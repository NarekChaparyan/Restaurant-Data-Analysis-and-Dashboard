But everything else was awesome.  The food was great, but the two problems that contributed most to my disappointment were 1) I made an OpenTable reservation for the dining room but when I arrived I was told the dining room was being used for a private event (so why was I allowed to reserve a table in it??), and 2) the host who was also our waiter spoke and understood very little English so it was like ordering in another country.

Perfect Sunday brunch!  I made it to my reservation an hour early & they accommodated me. Great service, food & drinks were amazing  Great experience. Bar area was bustling and loud but our table was nicely quieter in a full dining room. Was seated promptly at reservation time. Waiter was excellent; happy to give a sample of wine before serving it. Halibut and ravioli plates excellent along with apps. Reasonably priced for the area. Read more Food was great and the place is so beautiful. For whatever reason the service was super slow though. We had to track down a waiter because no one came to our table after we were seated and then once we did get a waiter we only saw him twice and it took forever to get the check.

The table attendants were attentive and friendly and to top off a great evening the manager even offered to check the line downstairs at the club to ensure that we wouldn’t have to wait too long.

So many other better options in West Loop. Our server was the sweet though, wish I remember her name! Read more Still thinking about the pistachio ravioli! Our group had a great time and enjoyed sharing many different plates.  Would’ve enjoyed my experience more if my server and bus boy weren’t so pushy. Our group just wanted light snacks and drinks and the staff seemingly didn’t like that. The bus boy was way too aggressive. He was literally lurking in the corner making my entire group uncomfortable waiting for us to be done, and in fact, kept taking plates we weren’t done with. It was extremely uncomfortable. We came for the hot dog cocktail and I kid you not- he snatched the drink out of my friends hand as he was eating the hot dog garnish. Would not recommend because there are plenty of just as good restaurants if not better in the city where I feel more comfortable.

ty**

Nestled in the heart of Chicago’s vibrant Fulton Market District, *Cira* offers a refreshing take on Mediterranean cuisine with a modern twist. From the moment you step into the restaurant, the ambiance captures your attention—minimalistic yet warm, with soft lighting and elegant décor that sets the mood for a relaxing yet sophisticated dining experience.

The menu is a delightful journey across the Mediterranean. We started with the mezze platter, which featured a selection of fresh, flavorful dips—especially the whipped feta with herbs, which was a standout. The lamb kebab was succulent and perfectly spiced, while the seafood paella brought a burst of vibrant flavors, cooked to perfection. Each dish was beautifully presented, reflecting the care taken in preparation. The portions were generous but not overwhelming, leaving just enough room for dessert. The olive oil cake with honeyed yogurt was the perfect sweet finish—light, fragrant, and not too heave: 4/5**
The service was attentive, though not overbearing. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered great wine pairings to complement our meal. However, the food took a little longer to arrive than expected during the peak dinner hour, but the wait was woriance: 5/5**
Cira’s interior is both sleek and inviting, making it ideal for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends. The open kitchen adds a lively energy to the space, while the quiet corners allow for intimate conversations. The blend of soft music and the buzzing atmosphere creates the perfect dining enOverall: 4.5/5**
*Cira* is a gem in the city’s dining scene, offering high-quality Mediterranean-inspired dishes in Read more Great food, good service, and they were able to surprise my wife with a dessert and a candle for her birthday, which made it even better. Thank you!  I often follow Infatuation for recommendations in Chicago.  We had been to Cira once before and I was surprised at the dismal review by Infatuation.  But we decided to go again anyway and we are so very glad we did.  It was surprisingly easy to get a last minute reservation, probably because of how much space they have in the lobby of the Hoxton Hotel.  The ambiance was fun modern and comfortable, the service was incredibly friendly attentive and helpful, and mainly, the food was inventive and delicious!  We had browned butter hummus and an heirloom tomato and melon salad that was devine, and our mains were as well - Pistachio ricotta ravioli and a beautiful mediterranean Halibut.  We will definitely be back and consider this one of our favorite go tos for a special night out in vibrant West Loop. Read more Only complaint I have is that the chairs 
are too low for short people.  The best restaurant in Chicago! The drinks a delish, the ambience is dim lighting, high ceilings, L train behind the windows, so so so cool  Nicholas was our server and he was fantastic! Great recommendations and all of it was delicious!  Great, as always! I love to bring my laptop and work through lunch or spend my remote days at Cira. The hostess was very perceptive to my potential need to be seated near an outlet. The stuffed dates and baba ganoush are my go-tos while deciding on my main course. I tried the grain bowl with lamb kofta added for the first time today and it was just as refreshing as my server, Julian, suggested! Read more Read more This was one of the best meals I have had in my life, seriously. The pistachio ravioli are to die for. Would recommend to anyone. I only took off a star because the guy who removed are plates and our server throughout the meal seamed to be a in a hurry to move the table for next reservation, we do understand there are other tables but a fine dining experience should never feel rushed. When the server came back after dessert he asked if we wanted anything else and when we said no he already had the check in his hand and placed it on the table… we all commented on it afterwards. Anyhow, the food was absolutely spectacular and would come back as many times as I could. Thank you Cira. Read more Best meal I’ve had in a while 10 out of 10 highly recommend  Excellent! They gave us free champagne and fudge balls for our anniversary 🥰  10/10, food was amazing, staff was great and very helpful!  Fantastic food and staff! Would definitely recommend!  It was my birthday and Bruce was our helper. He made sure to take good care of us, and my our time extra special  Wonderful food quality and service! I loved the pistachio ravioli and the fresh hummus/pita was excellent.  The food was delicious with the exception of the chickpea caramel ice cream that came with the brownie. It was extremely salty.  Additionally we would have greatly appreciated it if the restaurant had offered rice as an option as it is extremely common with the cuisine they serve.

Service was very polite and would have been excellent if it weren’t so slow.  We had long waits between server visits.  The drinks took a really long time and our entrees came out so long apart that my partner was nearly finished before mine arrived.  The server didn’t even seem to notice there was an issue.  I believe the server had too many tables.

This is personal preference obviously, but we found the music  to be uncomfortably loud.  It you want a party atmosphere, you would probably love it, but if you just want to have a nice dinner it might not be the place for you. Read more Food lacked flavor.  Service was average at best.

Not going back!  This was our first time at Elia.  We had lunch and were very pleased. The food was delicious, especially the lamb chops. Cooked perfectly, not overdone. 
The service was outstanding.  We will definitely return for dinner.  Elia is on our list of recommended restaurants. Read more This place is always inconsistent.   Last night our food was very good but the service was very spotty.   There were probably 6 filled tables in the restaurant but it seemed as though we had to search for our server.  At one point I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for our server who was not to be seen.  
Our server was very pleasant and informed but not always available. Read more Positive about my experience at Elia:
- nice atmosphere
- indoor/outdoor seating
- very nice wait staff

To be improved:
- My friend and I found the quality of the food very average. We always say that’s the company that matters but having great food matters too.
- On the day we went, the restaurant closed at 9pm. My own fault, I didn’t check. It felt weird having the waiter telling us we had to order desert at 8:30pm because the kitchen slides at 9pm, as we were just starting to eat. Given the quality of the main dish, we passed. Read more Read more This restaurant worked well for an early(ish) dinner outdoors. We could talk without raising our voices (save for the occasional ambulance passing and motorcycle cruisers with absurdly loud audio blasting as they looked at their reflections in shop windows).
The food was very good and good value. My only reservation was that they seemed to be short of staff, so things were moving a little slowly. However, the staff they had were very polite, courteous, and not pushy or overly talkative. We will go again. Read more I was excited to try Elia. I look forward to returning. Food was tasty and the details in the esthetic at the restaurant are exquisite.  Good service and specials and good sized menu. Enjoyed the food and will go back.  Elia was amazing ! Me and my boyfriend reserved a table for our 3 year anniversary and I must say ….. the food was beyond extravagant. The service was so good. Our server, Sue, was wonderful as well. The staff was so nice even if they weren’t our servers. One staff member even offered to take our photos. When I say this place is legit, I mean it. We will be back ! 🙂
Thank You Elia ! Read more We dined outside for dinner. The service was very slow and our server was long between visits to the table. We ordered a bottle of wine and were brought two glasses and then were asked if we wanted another glass. We had to remind her we ordered a bottle which she forgot so we were just served two glasses of wine and paid for the bottle. This was frustrating. We each ordered a salad with salmon. The salmon was very overcooked, potentially not as fresh so cooked to mask. Salads were fine, premade. Not worth the price for the street and very empty for a Wednesday night. We had high hopes but fell through.

Reading the reviews, it appears most are from staff or the same person as they are very repetitive in verbiage, grammar, etc, raving about dishes in a specific way. Inflating 5 start reviews won't help any customer. Read more Menu items seems very good and we were looking forward to trying something special.  Overall, it was mediocre-at-best.

Starting with the bread, for that price they charge I expected fresh bread that is baked inhouse.  This was not the case.

Oliver oil, it was more vinegary that oily.  I suggest you just put at bottle of Oil & vinegar on the table and let decide.

We order 2 appetizers:
1. Dumpling!!! (I just I should have known not to order dumpling in a middle eastern restaurant, my bad).
2. Octopus, this was good. 

Then we ordered the Mixed Grill platter and Grilled Chicken.  Mixed platter: lamb was amazing, minced meat was very good but Chicken was dry.  But the quantity was very small...

2 appetizers, 2 plates, 2-beers were $120.

Overall for the price, we expected more. Read more We had dinner at Elia last week and we were really pleased. The seafood appetizers we ordered were very fresh and delicious. For the main course, we chose salmon and sea bass, both of which were excellent. The service was fast and the waiters were very attentive. The atmosphere was also very nice, we had a relaxing evening. I definitely recommend Elia, it’s an ideal place for a delicious and enjoyable experience Read more Elia has a large menu for both food and drinks. The venue is one of the nicest on the street, and the service along with the staff are very friendly. The food comes out warm and quickly  Went on Mother's Day at 3:45pm. Food was great, but service and ￼was poor. From the minute we walked in, the host (or maybe manager) was very unfriendly. It was between lunch and dinner, and the restaurant was essentially empty inside w/a few tables outside. We had a reservation, and I asked for a specific table by the window. At first, he said it was booked, which made no sense since it was essentially empty￼ inside and I had a reservation.￼ He did sit us there, but he was not friendly, didn't smile or welcome us at all. It seemed like we were annoying him by being there. ￼The server was very busy, as he was serving outside tables as well. He was friendly enough, but wasn't very attentive. And when I tried to get eye contact with someone else inside, no one was picking up on our cues. Our food was very good, especially the Hummus and Adana kebab. But nobody ever checked on us after the food was served or asked us how everything was. It was like they really did not care they were there nor did they care if we ever came back. ￼Not sure I would return based on this alone. Read more Great food, wonderful dining experience!

It’s hard to spend $160 on a dinner for 4 people and not have quality food or service- unfortunately, we are taking this restaurant off of our rotation because side this is the second bad experience we have had…the first poor experience I chalked up to a bad night. We used to live going to Blanco, sadly things have taken a turn for the worse- $27 fajitas with stringy, chewy meat for the second time in a row…leads us to choose differently the next time- Read more Read more Excellent Mexican food- the best!

Upon arrival, they sat me and my guest right next to another table, which was not necessary.

The food was good, but I would say this is more of a $$$$ than the $$$ it advertises.  The wine-by-the-glass selection is excellent.  My guest and I both ordered Filets, and they were good.  I got the 5 oz, and it was a bit overcooked; my guest ordered the 10 oz, and it was cooked perfectly.  They put a sauce on the side with the steak (you get to choose), and this seemed very unnecessary, almost like they weren't sure of the quality of the meat they were offering.  We requested no sauce, but they then chose one for us and brought it out. We didn't use it, but thought that was a bit odd.

The food was okay as was the service. The winner is the ambiance.  Great lunch spot.  The menu is small but that's sometimes a great thing.  I had the tomato soup and blackberry grilled cheese.  It was delicious.  I definitely recommend giving this place a try.  Good place to go in a suburban wasteland.  Varied menu, interesting options.  Nice servers.   It was fine for the evening, but not so much a destination for us. Hummus needed lemin, plate needed veggies.  Carnitas apparently very good.  Avocado burratta very good.  Skip dessert. Read more Food was great.  Service was great as well. Highly recommend  Inside the rose hotel overall good  food and good drinks!  First time I had been at your restaurant actually my company used to be on that site about a few years ago was looking forward to your breakfast and will be back again for dinner. I just felt my first experience was a little off as I had to come up to ask for my water because I sat a bit longer than usual waiting for service, I will give my next experience another other than that. Everything else was awesome. They did recap after that. Thank you so much. Read more Read more Very attentive service. Every time we ordered drinks, they came to us within minutes. Food came out plentiful, hot and delicious. Clean plate club for both of us!

The only odd thing was the weather had been bad the last 3 days, and that night…again. Tornado warnings and sirens going off everywhere! We were surrounded by windows and not one staff seemed concerned nor told us to move to an interior, lower or safer area. So my out of town co-worker and I booked it outta there to my home, thankfully only 10 min away, to seek safe shelter (basement), since we weren’t getting that option at the hotel. Weird circumstance, but even the Target a few weeks ago made everyone in the store (!!!!) go to their back storage area during a tornado warning. Read more Terrible service. No host to be found, didn’t even acknowledge we were there. Just terrible.  We dined in the lounge area to enjoy the Saturday night live music.   Service was excellent. Cocktail and other beverage selections were great and delicious.  I had a truly outstanding double smash burger with very tasty fries, and my wife had a delicious steak cooked perfectly. We will certainly return on another Saturday for music and a delicious meal. Read more The food wasn’t impressive & they seemed short staffed  Everything was amazing as always. The only thing that became annoying after some time was the music that was too loud.  Great food and service! Will definitely book again when I am back in town.  Great place to be for a gathering  with friends, ect  I’m not usually a fan of hotel restaurants but the food and the service was great  The staff was so accomodating considering that we accidentally booked for lunch during an event that was already set up. they gave us a separate room & the service and food was delicious. Only issue was when we booked we were looking at the dinner menu and not the lunch menu so the item list was much shorted but we each found something we could get. Food and desserts were delicious. thanks to Mike for allowing us to keep our reservation & treatly us so royally. Read more Bad service, very slow. Food was gross, way over priced. Drinks tasted like garbage. Terrible experience. Extremely disappointed.  Read more Service was a bit slow. Food was mediocre. I guess what you can expect from a hotel lounge.  A great find. The food was delicious and a bit different. The atmosphere was better than pictured online. My only suggestion would be to put the name Thorn on the outside of the building.  The food was mediocre.

The worst part was I picked this restaurant for a business meeting during a snow storm because they say free valet parking. They had no valet parking! Read more In the Rose hotel but the bar selection was great and food surprisingly good.  Worthy of its rating.  Food and service were exceptional. We got placed in the private dining room because we were large party and it was beautiful! We will definitely be back.  I had the medí platter and the hummus was delicious. The plating was stunning. I tried the mule in the meadow cocktail and it was perfect on the palate as well as on the eyes.  Went with just the small plates. Everything had a good flavor and paired well with the cocktails.  After reading several reviews, I brought some friends and family here. It has low-quality diner food and very spotty service.  The burgers were ok. It was partly my fault as I did not research enough to know it was a food service center and a budget hotel. It was just unexpected in the entertainment district in Rosemount. Read more Overall, the food was delicious. It is very hard to eat chicken and waffles though with bone in chicken and my waffle was cold when it came out. The short ribs and appetizers, hummus and flatbread were really tasty. The burger and fries were good too. The ambience was nice, but a little strange being open inside a hotel.

Will definitely come back!  We expected a cozy, warm restaurant, but to our surprise the restaurant, was pretty brightly lit and lacked a little bit in the ambience aspect. The drinks were really yummy, but the food was pretty subpar.

We’ve been to Chicago q 3x now. Our first 2 visits were amazing all around, but this last visit missed the mark in when it comes to service. We sat in the bar/lounge area and the bartender was also our server.

Lovely atmosphere, great drinks, food snd service!  Great food for the money. Clean location and friendly staff.  Read more Really great BBQ. When the food arrives, everyone is envious of everyone else's order. Would definitely go back. Happy hour menu is also a great value.  We went to Q’s to celebrate my wife’s birthday.

Read more Excellent BBQ. St Louis ribs were fall off the bone tender.  Food was very good but not quite as good as a previous visit.  Consistency in preparation would be much preferred.  Coleslaw was more sour than previous visits.  Pulled pork was moist and tender and particularly yummy on brioche bun.  Carrot cake outstanding as were house made pickles.  House made potatoes chips very good although a bit too salty. Read more Place was not empty. It took over 20 mins to receive service. Food comes out fast. They gave us free drinks to apologize for the slow service. I would come back, the food was pretty good.

I don't know why we do hear more about them. Great ribs. Definitely worth a visit!  Pretty good for a ""for big city"" BBQ joint.  The potato chips deserve special attention - they were excellent.

Had a birthday and good carrot cake  Read more The food is really good here. Whenever I'm in Chicago I try and eat here... But, I think the 3% credit card charge fee is not on. This to me is a restaurant taking advantage of diners. It may only be a small amount..but it leaves a bad taste. There is a cost to do business.. Figure it out, but let's not fleece the diner Read more Regrettably, both baby and St. Louis ribs were extremely overcooked. Was very disappointing. This was true of my guests ribs as well. So it was not a one son anomaly. I am a long time patron of Chicago Q, so I am hopeful this was a one time issue. Read more I definitely would return to try more dishes and excellent service.  First serve of ribs arrived cold. They were replaced. Second set of ribs were dry. Should have bad the hamburger as that looked much better.

It was obvious we were not the server’s favorite table, she was cold and barely checked on us. Yet with the other tables she was chatty, even with her coworkers. To send my daughter’s dinner first and leaving my son and myself watching her finish her dinner and get our plates much later was not okay. As we start to eat she only comes by to ask unkindly if “we need anything?” I wanted another drink but did not order because of her approach. It was uncomfortable to repeatedly hear her say if we order another kiddie cocktail it will be charged, my daughter only asked for one, not my son.. and she still charged us for it. He left it there, untouched. I couldn’t finish my salad, it was an unpleasant experience. I really do not want to ever go back. I’m sure it won’t matter anyway.

The food was delicious including the butternut squash soup, pizzas, salads, and the fish tacos.  We loved every bite!

I’ve been here before a birthday and experienced alot better of an experience Read more We love this restaurant 
Food and ambiance is amazing  On my recent visit to Summer House Santa Monica in Chicago, I was impressed with some standout items that made the meal even more enjoyable. First, the Mexican Hash Browns were a delicious surprise—crispy on the outside and packed with flavor on the inside, with just the right amount of spice. They had a great mix of textures, and the seasoning elevated a simple side to something special.

Next, the bacon was cooked to perfection: crispy yet tender, and it had that savory, smoky taste that’s hard to get just right. It complemented the sweeter items perfectly, especially the Blueberry Pancakes. These pancakes were fluffy and light, with a generous amount of blueberries in every bite, adding a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness.

The drink selection also impressed. The Old Fashioned was spot-on, with a well-balanced blend of bourbon, bitters, and just the right amount of sweetness. It was smooth and strong, a classic done right. For something lighter, I enjoyed the Sparkling Prosecco, which was refreshing and paired well with the meal, adding a bubbly, celebratory touch to the overall experience.

These items, combined with the great atmosphere, really made this visit special and memorable! Read more The hostess was rude, we told her we checked in for our reservation around 1215 letting her know we all had arrived, she confirmed and said that the tables are being cleaned and that she will text me shortly. Then 20 minutes go by, and we check again, and she never checked us in as all have arrived. All this was done with so much attitude.

Always a go to spot when I have visitors in town.  Ordered cookies before dinner at the dessert bar before we sat down for dinner. My kids (5yr and 3yr) specifically said birthday cookie. The cashier confirmed. We got home and found out she gave us an oatmeal scotch cookie instead. The kids lost it.  I tried calling for over 20 minutes, but no one answered.  Unfortunately, 5 will remember this for years (he still remembers when they cleared our table at pinstripes after we told them we weren’t done 2 yrs ago and every time we go back, he tells the waiter).

They had our table ready, and took orders right away to keep us moving through our 90 minute timing.  Food was very good, too.  Great service & experience as always. Upstairs patio was great!  Just amazing. Drinks and food in the shadow of the beautiful and historic landmark. Perfection.",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/42082578.webp

They didn’t  refill water automatically. The music was too loud.  Drove two hours to patronize this restaurant for my birthday. Made a reservation and were  seated about 20 minutes past the reservation time. The hostess was very nice and professional. We waited a little under two hours for food. There were three people that came in before us they had already gotten their food and was finishing their dinner. We still had nothing. We asked the waitress who was very nice and professional And friendly when our food would be up and she said it wouldn’t be much longer. She offered us three pieces of cornbread for the long wait. About 20 minutes later she came and said it would be another five minutes. Another 20 minutes passed and we still had not gotten our food. almost at the two hour mark she comes back and tells my friend that they don’t have the dish he ordered and brings out a totally different dish instead. That was unprofessional and absolutely ridiculous. In two hours, they should know What food they are out of and offer some type of complementary dish or a huge discount on the bill. Sadly, we left and didn’t get to experience the food at all. We wasted $29 on parking 2 1/2 hours of driving time and two hours of sitting and waiting for food. We never indulged in Very disappointing and a sad way to spend my birthday Read more Overpriced. Long waits. Very loud. Out of desired food.  Food was fire and the service
Get the Düsse frozen drink 🔥  It was amazing being that it was our first time. We truly enjoyed ourselves && the waiter was very polite, pleasant and friendly. The guy at the front counter was very polite and quick to get us seated even after we was late. Read more Party of 4 patronized K&K for their weekend brunch.  We were greeted by Ashley who was very friendly, gave recommendations and explained the menu.  However, she failed to disclose the up-charge for the frozen Patron drinks and the restaurant not offering change if you pay in cash.  Please disclose up-charges  and the cash payment policy upfront.

The food was okay.  I ordered the catfish breakfast and a blackberry margarita.  My potatoes were served cold, while the fish was served crispy and hot.  My eggs and cheese were scrambled with shredded cheese on top.  I was not a fan.  Honestly, I expected more for the price.  My blackberry margarita tasted like grape medicine, while it was pretty it was not worth the $28 price tag.  No I did not send any food back as I’m always afraid of what employees may do to your food behind the scenes.

Overall, I wasn’t impressed by K&K.  I’ll prefer good food and drinks over aesthetics.  I won’t be returning. Read more Absolutely Delicious! I Loved The Ambience & The Food Was 10/10  Adrian the bartender was cool, but the restaurant and food?! Thumbs down for sure! This place is overpriced and overrated. The chicken and fried pickles were salty couldn’t even eat them. $21 for a rum punch and $20 for a lemon drop that tasted like juice. The employees were hanging around at the bar where my girlfriend and I were sitting trying to enjoy the not so tasty food. Not to mention the automatic 20% gratuity that’s added. I will never go back to Kitchen + Kocktails ever again and will not recommend it either. I am so disappointed. Read more My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with Dinner at Kitchen and Kocktails Chicago!! Wow!!! From the time we entered until we left, it was amazing!!!

The management and front of house leader, Vaughn was awesome and top tier. Our server, Olivia, amazing!!!

We felt like VIP's. Just a great time and the food was just incredible. We had catfish and grits, and the Pasta! Oh yeah, the margarita (virgin for us) and Peach Cobbler outstanding!

Get there, asap, you'll love it. Read more It was a nice place. Floors are slippery but good food  Read more Our experience could’ve been better. With the built-in 20% gratuity the servers are not motivated to give excellent customer service. I will say our server was very friendly. Was about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our server. Our food and drink took too long to arrive. From when we ordered it was nearly 15 minutes before my cocktail was delivered. Then another 10-15 before the appetizer arrived. Kept running out of water too. After the appetizer it was 20-25 before our meal came out. Even then the order was not correct. Our sweet potatoes were forgotten.Would have loved to try them. The food was amazing. During our meal I have requested a Diet Coke. Took over 10 minutes to get one. Our bill was over $200! Not worth that much. Especially with the poor service. 
Later on that night we went to another high end restaurant for dinner. The service was top notch. They did not have the built-in 20% gratuity. Those servers were motivated to give the best customer service experience and they delivered. Didn’t wait more than a few minutes for beverages. The wait for our food was significantly shorter. I should add I ordered a 48oz steak and the wait was shorter! That restaurant was packed while Kitchen+Kocktails at the time we were there was not even close to being as busy as that place. 
Would we return to Kitchen+Kocktails? Possibly. Would like to see the built-in gratuity eliminated. Then the servers would be motivated to give better and faster service. I must add I do tip at least 20% on my own. More for outstanding service. Once again food was amazing. But the service has to match. Ambience was great though. Read more Some of the best soul food i ordered in a while! Definitely is must visit again!!!  Food is too salty and grossly overpriced. Go to Virtue in Hyde Park for high quality southern cuisine  Our waitress was named Butter. She was friendly, professional and had lots of personality. She didn’t steer us wrong with her recommendations.  I was visiting Chicago, never heard about this restaurant and let me tell you it was everything! Everything was on point from the service to the food! Loved it!  My friend and i came there for the 1st time and we really enjoyed ourselves. Our Waitress Kenya was great, she made great suggestions for our appetizers, entrees and drinks. We would definitely come again. Read more The food is delicious. The peach cobbler is scrumptious!! Fried catfish the bomb!! I didn’t have a cocktail, but they looked pretty and I was told were good. BUT the food is pricey. It’s ala carte. $9 for 2 pieces of cornbread?! I didn’t mind paying for what I want, but I don’t want to be taken advantage of either. Read more Had a reservation still had to wait 20+ minutes. Was seated at a high top table by the bar, even though I had a reservation for regular table service was slow. Food was great. They ran out of one of the key ingredients for the drink we wanted. The 20% gratuity added to each check is a bit much for subpar service waiting over 20 minutes with the reservation and being seated basically at the bar. Read more The food was very good.   We were seated on time. The server was excellent. She explained the menu very well, check on us throughout our time there.  Excellent place to dine.  They don’t give you enough time to enjoy yourself and the food. We were rushed to leave and be done after spending 230.00 for two people 2 entrees and 2 alcoholic drinks.  Read more Usually food always  take forever coming out and is worth the wait this time chicken was fried to hard and cornbread didn’t taste fresh. I think because gratuity is added ahead staff don’t give good service to earn the tip. Waitress was awful. Read more We were on time for our reservation and waited about 20 minutes to get sat. No big deal. Once sat to took another 20 minutes to get greeted by the server. $25 cocktails that are not strong or even full sized drinks. Music was good but very loud. On top of people screaming at the top of their lungs watching a football game. We had been waiting over an hour before we had to flag the waitress down to place our food order. The food was pretty good but definitely overpriced. Sooo many up charges on the menu and cash grabs once inside. The experience was totally disappointing especially given the cost. I wanted to love this place but it was bad. Read more Food was good…service was good at the beginning at first then became none existent. Waitress took our cards and didn’t allow us to sign for our receipt!  My visit to Kitchen + Kocktails was long overdue, having seen them featured on Instagram as a must-check-out place in Chicago for over a year. I finally made my way there on a Saturday morning as soon as they opened. Initially, it wasn’t busy, yet it still took the server 20 minutes to take our drink order. To expedite things, we placed our food order at the same time, but that didn't help. Our food took an hour to arrive.

Our server only came to our table three times during the 1.5 hours we were there: once to take the order, once because I flagged another person to place another drink order, and finally to bring the check.

The food was mediocre, the service was awful, and the prices were ridiculously high, with an automatic 20% gratuity included despite the horrendous wait time. It's clear why the servers don't make a conscious effort to attend to you. Why would they, when their tip is guaranteed?

Save yourself the wasted time and choose a better restaurant with superior food and service. Read more The environment was dope but our server took away from the overall experience with it being our first time. The food was delicious though.  We loved our experience and will be back very soon!  The food was absolutely amazing but the service was at best a 2/10. It was basically impossible to get anyone to come to our table to take our dessert order or get the check, we were there for an hour and a half and our waitress came to our table only 3 times, the food was incredible but at that price point with automatically added 20% gratuity, I would hope to see my waitress more than every 45 minutes Read more Great experience! We loved our server Robert! 10/10 recommend  An amazing amazing experience, Kaylay was a delightful young lady- she knew her stuff about the menu and made awesome suggestions!  A memorable experience, we'll be back!  My food wasn't even warm when it arrived at my table. The short rib was very salty, I paid $29 dollars for 1 yes I said 1 small crab cake barely the size of the inside palm of my hand!!!  The coke I ordered was very watered down, there were no free refills on the drinks. I ordered waffles and they came out cold and dry! Where we were seated was noisy because we were seated right across a part of like 20 people.The only good experience was I was late for my reservation and K&K was able to update a new reservation for me right away it was sno line no waiting and we were seated almost immediate
That was very kind. The other nice experience was the place has beautiful decor inside and the chairs were extremely comfortable. I appreciate that! Overall only 2 stars. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/52860185.webp

They brought a birthday dessert which was really nice!
Paella was very good as main course.
All in all, it was a nice dinner! Read more Outstanding experience, enjoyed and Anthony was a fantastic waiter  It seemed like everyone was a little crabby. We had a waitress walk up and ask us our drink order.  Apparently we were taking too long (there were two of us) and confessed to disliking Pepsi with makers mark. She walked away from our table. lol. We ended up with Samuel who was good, but didn’t seem super excited about being there. The vibe was off. The food was delicious and filling and way more expensive than the last time we were there in November, 2023. I’m not sure we’ll return. We’ve been there at least 6 times and the Coke product thing is really a deal breaker. What about having a secret stash of diet and regular coke for those of us who will not compromise or paying a little extra to satisfy the majority of us who prefer Coke? Read more We ordered the two eggs potatoes and toast breakfast with a side of chicken sausage. The food came out extremely fast and was all delicious. We asked for cheers on the eggs and got a lot. The potatoes were really good also.

It was a little expensive of course but that’s expected being at a hotel restaurant in downtown Chicago.

But it was worth it because of the food and quick service. Read more We arrived for an early dinner before a show. Very few other guests in the restaurant. The server was pleasant. But service was slow. Cocktails were overpriced for the overly sweet, marginal quality.
Food was completely uninspired.
Location and view are good but doesn’t make up for the experience. Read more  We had excellent service, excellent food.  Our arms and our drink glasses stuck to the sticky table.  It was definitely not a problem of the previous tables’s server or or cleaner not cleaning correctly, it was a problem of old tables who’s finish finish has degraded into a ￼ constantly sticky mess. Still, best Spanish food still since we went to spain years ago. Read more First, the food is AMAZING. Scallops are maybe the best we’ve ever had. Also, there was this tomato bread that was insane, to go with the chorizo (which more resembles prosciutto). Also crazy good.
That said, portions were tiny portions. Entrees are almost the same size as apps.
Waiter talked A LOT sand was kinda slow. Also didn’t get the salad we ordered.
Worth it if you’re staying in the hotel, or one nearby. But maybe not a destination restaurant. Read more A picturesque restaurant with good service. I would say the food was overall good - nothing memorable for the expensive price point. Having lived in Spain - the menu’s aim for authenticity is there, but I think most dishes needed more seasoning and spices. The roasted chicken was definitely the best dish of the evening in terms of taste, and it is a good “bang for your buck” option. The lamb was well cooked but such a small portion for $36.00! The two tapas we had were average - patatas bravas are hard to mess up generally but I felt that they needed some more spice and chili. Skip the stuffed red peppers - too much goat cheese, and the aioli was too salty. The complimentary glasses of Cava to celebrate our wedding anniversary was a nice touch. Read more Our server, Samuel, was amazing! He gave us wonderful recommendations and amazing service!  Great tapas. Shared a variety at happy hour an they were fantastic. Service was amazing.  Had a great time eating the delicious food! Service was fantastic! Was able to accommodate the vegan and gluten-free requests of one of our guests.  Would definitely go again!  Being from Catalunya, our standards might be higher than others, but the food was average at best. The service was not extremely friendly or very attentive, the food took a long time to be served, the atmosphere is a bit dated, and the place needs a deep clean. The table tops were so sticky, you could barely lift your glass off if it. Read more Everything was perfectly fine. Just didn’t really feel the love in the service or the food. No problems at all. I was just hoping for a little more.  The glazed carrots were phenomenal. Seafood in the paella was nicely cooked. Crackers in the cheese and iberico courses were delicious. Read more We have loved this restaurant as a family and we're really looking forward to eating there and celebrating my daughter's bday. We hadn't been there since Covid. In fairness we went on a Monday night, so it was a Monday. That said, the ambience was not the same. Lights were never lowered, no hip Spanish music playing, it was lack luster. The food was ok, not great. Seasoning and presentation had changed in many signature dishes. Calamari and potatoes were over salted. The waiter left a dish off and it was served at the end instead of at the beginning. We were not given clean plates throughout the meal; only once after the 2nd tapas was brought out. Empty serving plates were not cleared frequently enough and it was hard to manage our table space. We had to keep asking for someone to take empty plates. It was not busy. We walked away feeling let down with the experience we were looking forward to. Read more Very disappointed that they have changed their procedure that you have to order all your tapas at once.  This is not how a Tapas restaurant works.  The fun is gone.  Then when we did order they rushed us through the courses.  Not close to the experiences we have previously has there and not sure we will return to this restaurant. Read more  I had a wonderful meal of stuffed dates, veggie paella and two cocktails.  The service was on point.  I would certainly eat here again on another trip.  Awesome food and drinks, very cool atmosphere and such a cool building… Paella was top notch!  Food was amazing. Shame the service was a disappointment.  Great experience! We got 2 of the small Paella and it’s was enough for 4 people. The food was delicious! Maybe a little over salted but that was okay. The sangria was also quite refreshing for a muggy day. We got there right when they opened so it was nice and quiet. The restaurant is beautiful! Read more Food was good. Overall experience was terrible! Server was pushy and rude, and obviously sick with Covid or some other respiratory ailments, as he was coughing all over the dining room and quite obnoxious when talking to us at the table. Interrupted us during a conversation to try to take plates when it was obvious that we weren’t finished eating. Not sure why this behavior was happening, but totally wrecked our meal. Read more Nice environment and great service. The food is absolutely fine.  We were staying at the Blackstone.   One word....ATTITUDE.  They are understaffed but when they are fully staffed the attitudes remain.  I really appreciated the server and kitchen accommodating my need for dairy-free options.

Thank you La Grande Boucherie￼  We ordered cocktails and placed our entree orders. No sooner had we got our drinks, our dinners were brought.  No time to linger and enjoy the cocktails.  
The cocktails were very nice.  
half price bottled wine was very good value.  
I ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon and was disappointed in the small amount of beef and too many potatoes.  The potatoes were undercooked.  Only a couple carrots and one small mushroom. Very little sauce/gravy.  I wasn’t expecting a “stew”but was definitely expecting more sauce that could last for all the vegetables and maybe dip the bread.  
Chocolate mouse was very good, espresso after dessert also good. Read more Everything was great except two notable things: (1) the fries were terrible (I don't say this lightly). Maybe the oil was old, but they were dark and soggy. We did not eat them. When you do steak frites you've got to get this right. The Madeleines we had for dessert were soggy. We left them as well. Otherwise, the service was excellent and the ambience was great (even though it was very busy). Read more The food was good. However, the service was a bit slow.

Just exquisite. One of the best steak we have had.
On top of the amazing food, the service was amazing. Matthew took amazing care of us and was very helpful with the choice of food. Matthew has been caring and sweet to us.
We also met a very nice francophone that works at the restaurant, Rachid, who took the time to advise us on deserts (we had the crème brûlée and paris-brest) and exchange with us (as we are francophone as well).

It is above and beyond wonderful.  Adalina is nice, not amazing, although it thinks it is. The tables are quite crowded together and it was really loud overall.

I liked it, but probably wouldn't go back. Read more We love coming here for some quick bites and great drinks. We don’t normally make reservations (for happy hour) but since we knew ahead of time, we did and had the option to sit at a cozy booth. But sitting at the bar during their happy hour is great too.

Service is always great too. Read more My service was AMAZING. Got busy really quick and therefore loud but the atmosphere was beautiful.  It was perfect, as usual. It never disappoints.

Read more Excellent date night location, wonderful food and environment.  Had a great meal for three. Food and service was excellent.  This restaurant is not open the hours that it states it is both on its own website and on Open Table. I made a last minute reservation on Open Table for 8:30 PM on Sat. based on their kitchen staying open until 9:30 PM and their bar until 11PM. When we walked in we were greeted with ""we tried to call you because we are closing at 9 PM."" (I didn't see the call/text). They tried to seat us next door at Encore, but they said they were already closed (at 8:30). We did stay, but we felt rushed. They did have  people in the restaurant, so it wasn't that it was completely dead. Also, the air conditioning was blasting (and it was cold outside) and we asked for it to be turned down, but either they could not or would not do so. So we dined being cold and rushed. The food was actually quite good, but I probably would not return based on the hours that they are open. They really should correct their website and Open Table listings to reflect that.

The restaurant opened up in 1952, and has been in continuous service ever since. Tom's serves only USDA prime aged beef for all of their steaks which are cooked to perfection on a grill over an open flame.

The star of the show at Tom's are obviously the steaks. Here, diners can order all of the best cuts of meat including filet mignon, bone-in rib eye, prime rib, NY Strip , and T-bone. However, Tom's also does much more than just steaks. Diners will also find seafood, poultry and pork options as well. Some of the most ordered non-steak items include a Athenian Chicken, grilled lamb chops, fresh filet of Atlantic salmon and steamed Alaskan king crab legs.","Read more Our second time here and oh what a contrast to the first time (which was only a month ago)! A polite server (Josie), but very little interaction with the staff otherwise. My drink was made incorrectly with raspberry instead of cranberry. It was terrible. The salads, Dover Sole, Rib-Eyes, and Prime Rib were all good. The bus boy kept slamming dirty dishes into the basin on his cart so hard that everyone jumped every time.

Great food, great service!  I understand the need to put a credit card down in order to secure a reservation, but the flip side of that is my table needs to be ready when I arrive.  I know there can be hiccups with people at a table too long, but if you are going to make me put a credit card down to make a reservation, then I have to be seated when I am there at the appointed time.  At Gibsons, that was not the case.  We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated for our 7:30 reservation and that's unfair.  There are too many places to go to that can handle reservations appropriately (and take a credit card for the reservation) to make Gibsons a regular stop for me.  It started the evening on a low note.  Then it was so crowded, our waitress needed 10-15 minutes before we even ordered drinks.  Now we are there over 30 minutes and we haven't been served a thing.  The waitress was nice and as the restaurant emptied out, she was way more attentive, so it was clear she just had too many tables.  Food was great.  Loved the crab/avocado appetizer.

Mansour our server was wonderful. He was knowledgeable and very helpful in making our food choices.  Amazing food, friendly/timely and quality service.  Great drinks as well.  Food was pretty good, service was good, but general atmosphere wasn’t as good as we expected. Prices are high, but soap dispensers are hanging on a black tape in their restrooms, also no paper towels and as a result no way to open the bathroom’s door without touching it! Don’t forget it’s an Indian restaurant where people suppose to eat with hands a lot (bread and gravies at Least). There where no toilet paper in my bathroom, it was at the end of the day though, but still! I didn’t like that bathroom is just by the kitchen and kitchen has no door except some curtains. Also you always meet waiters and kitchen workers in that corridor which leads you to the restrooms and it’s not very comfortable.

As for me - the restroom is a “face” of any restaurant, if it’s clean and taken care of - it means kitchen is clean and owners really care of that place.
When I imagine that chef used the bathroom and touched that door, then came back to the kitchen and made my salad with that hands - I almost want to , sorry. Read more We love Kama!

Read more Very tasty vegan options, creative cocktails, outdoor seating is very nice  This is my third time coming to Amerikas which means I've returned because of the good food and service I've received here the last two times. My only complaint had been how expensive it was for a single crab cake and no sides lol but unfortunately the server this time really made my friends and I uncomfortable. He was a shorter Hispanic man with a side part in his hair and a mustache. I don't recall him stating his name but he wasn't friendly at all which I was so surprised because everyone always has seemed so welcoming there. Not sure if it bothered him that we were sat indoors and we requested to be moved outside instead because there was no ac and it was way too humid to be inside.

We ordered drinks to begin and the waiter was just dry and when my friend asked for a recommendation he just answered very dryly but didn't seem like he cared about our experience at all. Servers usually ask what you like in order to best help you but he didn't. Once we ordered food, he came back about 10 min later saying that they were out of ceviche which of course doesn't fall on him but he didn't even offer to help with recommendations. My friend and I had both ordered ceviche so we were very disappointed that they were somehow out of it before 8 pm and after the experience with that server we decided we would be better off going to get pizza around the corner.

There were four of us and we walked away totally satisfied.  Food is always excellent at Seasons 52!

I highly recommend this place.  Great food, great service! Will come again for another special occasion.  The food and service were excellent. It was rather noisy.  Service and food was great.

I ordered the truffle mushroom with extra mushrooms and parmesan cream. Nothing different then tons of greens on top.

Had reservations for 4 people on Friday night at 8:45pm which was the last time slot for online reservations. My husband and I walked in at 8:55 and were told that the doors will be closed at 9pm and that our friends won’t be able to come in after 9pm. They also stated that the kitchen closes promptly at 9pm. I asked why they would even take a reservation at 8:45 considering their 9pm door and kitchen closer and the 2 males hosts replied with “we don’t make the rules”
The other host suggested it’s best if we leave bc of the 9pm closer.

Won’t be returning… Read more Everyone was very happy with their meals.  Service was awesome as always!!!  Don’t order the Beef Carpaccio. It’s a portion of food so small it’s like air. It was barely enough for one bite of food. They try to disguise this with bread toasts and a layer of peppers on top of their alleged beef then charge almost $18. We complained to our server who removed it from the bill. This was on top of their 3%service fee for their “hardship”, which everyone should have removed. I do go here frequently and like this restaurant but was so appalled at their money grab over this dish I had to post this. Read more I had the steak medallions special recommended by our server Memo. Everything was excellent and tge service was exceptional  Overall a great meal, we love all the homemade food.

We were seated a few minutes before our reservation time as we arrived a few minutes early, and planned to wait at the bar, but were delighted to get seated- at a cozy little (but roomy) booth for two!
Our server Adan was jovial, friendly and absolutely seemed to love his job! He treated us like long-lost friends! The pacing of his visits to our table between ordering and the course delivery were all perfectly timed for our liking!
Adan talked about the special risotto dish and described it well. We took him up on that and couldn’t have been happier. The beef tenderloin medallions were of large size and they melted in your mouth! I wish I could cook meat that well. The risotto was delicious! We raved about that meal all the way home.

Had to send back an entree because it was not hot. This is the first time ever that this has happened. I’d suggest that the sauce with the ravioli needs to be plated hot and the ravioli served right away. And it took the kitchen some time to bring back to the table. In the meantime the other diner had to get to eat their entree while the other diner waited. My rating is only poor for the kitchen.

Too bad because this is a great restaurant. It does get really noisy.  First time ever eating at this restaurant, over all an ok experience. Food was good.

Dinner entree included the special risotto with sausage, shrimp linguine, porcini ragu gnocchi, and sausage ragu cavettelli.  All delicious, though the sausage ragu was too sweet according to the food expert who ordered it.  We will be back to be sure it's a permanent improvement.

Food was superb- especially their dishes made with masa.  Not the best. Started off having to wait 30 min for our table. Then another 20 min until a service member actually approached the table.

On the other hand the cocktails are good but nothing special but the food was a big disappointment, the Cesar salad was tasteless and sour, the taco governador is just frozen shrimp in a tortilla with cheese no flavor you can't taste anything, the chicken was dry and With a lot of fatty parts, the cactus salad just tasted watery, the Barbacoa was the best of them but still needs some flavor in it, please remove the mint out of the recepy that kills all the meat flavors.

Again our server was great, the place is really pretty very nice looking bar, but they need to work in the food. Read more Excellent
The chef is personable and outstanding!  Very attentive service. Food was very good- especially the tuna tostada and the langoustines. Empanada was a bit doughy and the al pastor taco’s proportions were a bit off.

For the ambiance- it’s way too dark in there. You can’t see the food. Bar stools are big, heavy and hard to maneuver. Sounds silly but it’s a thing. Read more The waitress mentioned she would make sure the empanadas did not have any cheese that it would be on the side but then she asked if any of us had any food allergies. The appetizers came and the empanadas were stuffed with cheese. They gave us a small portion of tostadas when they ran out we waited 20 min for the waitress to come back. Also my margarita had a cucumber on the rim and not a lemon as seen on your social media photos. The drink was very basic and I did not even finish it. Dinner was just as bad we ordered the Wagyu steak and it definitely did not taste like Wagyu. The only good thing on that platter was the beans and onions. I did order the chicken and it was just as cold as the steak. Dessert was better than our first two courses but was just bland. Chicago is full of great restaurants and this is not one of them.

Will definitely be back Read more Excellent food, ambiance, and service. I highly recommend  The empanadas and tacos reminded me of CDMX the corn tortilla was perfect. The texture and flavor were spot on. Wife got the ossobucco while I had the pollo and the grilled vegetables were PERFECT. Only downside was I saw Fortaleza on the spirit list (IYKYK) and it was unavailable to order. Other than that everything was perfect. Also the pulparindo and the coco de oro were great! Will return next time I’m in town! Read more Vela is very beautiful inside, it was a romantic date night. Our server Ethan was kind and helpful and the service was quick. We came during happy hour so we took advantage of that a la carte menu to try more menu items. My favorite thing was the Tacos Gobernador. (Could’ve lived without the empanada.) Tuna tostada was good but really unique flavors. Langostinos were amazing but you do gotta do a little work to get them out of the shell and it’s a pretty small portion. The wagyu entree was really good but keep in mind it comes pretty rare so you may want to adjust that when ordering if it’s not your style. The Roma mocktail was so amazing if you’re looking for an N/A option. I saw there was a dining space a little more enclosed with lots of candles that was so beautiful, seems like a great spot to host a larger party. Worth the trip, will return.

Unclear how loud the seating indoors would be-  Always love the great service and the amazing food  I wish I had been told of possible loud noise on patio due to wedding occurring at space next door (outside wedding venue).  We were pleasantly surprised to find Eden tucked away where Roscoe dead ends. We sat outside and enjoyed cocktails and mocktails. The food was amazing: charcuterie board, gnocchi, roasted chicken, short rib stracci and mussels. We ended the evening with coffee and port wine. We were texting our friends and family telling them they had to come to Eden. They even sent us home with dessert and a thank you. We will definitely be back.

Food is very good and they are incredibly accommodating for someone with allergies (specially more than one).

(No water to drink, things ordered wouldn’t come in time)  Still love to come back here Read more Read more Great food, amazing space, indoor and out. I had the chicken pozole soup which was a special and it was really good. Love their French fries as well.  Brunch was outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, amazing pastry, everything beautifully prepared. Our server was the best and sitting on the patio was a treat - wonderful experience overall.  Always a great time with great food. Lovely staff :)  They offer a creative menu with great service experience.  We always enjoy our meals at Eden. This is a neighborhood gem you really shouldn't miss. It's a bit off the beaten path but, once you find it, you'll go back again and again. The food is really great (hint: try the pork belly!) and the service is friendly and professional.

The moon daisy cocktail was light and floral.
The sourdough was soft and flavorful. The hamachi crudo was spicy and fresh. The nichols farm compressed cucumber and watermelon salad was the best salad I've ever had. The red crab bucatini was delicious. The flat iron steak melted in my mouth! And even the carrots were perfect! The smores dessert was a surprisingly unique flavor!

The food at Davanti is always outstanding. Never had a bad item in the countless times we have eaten here. Our waiter was excellent and professional.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Read more We enjoyed our trip to Davanti's and were pleased with the attention to detail of the hosts, server and manager.  Our favorite is the polenta ragu, which has not changed since we first dined here.  It is delicious and a ""must have"" here.  The polpo preparation has changed over the past few years and while good, doesn't compare, in our opinion, to the single large piece that was served with a dark heavy vinaigrette dressing.  We loved the old/prior simple preparation of the beet salad.  It was all beets, with a fabulous walnut dressing.  The new prep is a full salad with beets sparingly placed in the mix.  It's great if you want a beet salad, but since we ordered their delicious chopped salad too, we were ""saladed out"". The wine list was not the same as the online menu, which we checked in advance using our wine app that really does a nice job of describing and rating the wines.  We were prepared to order a wine from that online list.  Because the restaurant's list was different, we needed some help and the manager was exceptional in this regard.

Lastly, the restaurant attempts an energetic environment with their music, which we have loved in the past.  A bit toooo much bass this time around. 

Doubly lastly, we like the different entrees served at this Scott Harris restaurant as a nice change up to the more Italian restaurants of his that we frequent often.  So it's worth the trip to see what's up. Read more This is our 5th visit to this restaurant.  It has an interesting menu and the food is expertly prepared.  

Friendly, helpful staff.

Fairly priced

Wonderful evening, sat outside on the patio, delicious food, good service, wonderful experience!  We always enjoy Davonti…the food is tasty and reliable.  Outdoor seating is a bonus on nice nights.

Food was good, not great, and expensive as are most restaurants now. Read more Having dined at Davanti many times, this experience was disappointing.

Sadly, the entire experience was a letdown. I don’t expect Michelin-level service at Cabra, but I do expect essential professionalism.
The waiter was rude and unprofessional.

This location features a full-service bar, and when the weather calls for it, outdoor seating. The interior design combines industrial elements with a vintage retro vibe that is reminiscent of the mid-20th century and the history of Oak Park. Whether you’ve been out shopping, strolling downtown or playing a round of golf, Lou Malnati’s Oak Park is the perfect spot to satiate your deep dish cravings.","Read more Our server was absolutely terrible. We waited for 25 mins after being seated and finally went up to the hostess to let them know we had never seen a server. She then appeared a few mins later. She took our order and brought our drinks 15 mins later. She brought my 6 year old water, instead of milk, like we ordered. She brought us 2 table settings, although we had 3 people. 2 hours later, our pizza arrived. It was not good at all. We were so completely upset by the time we left. Overall, I would NOT recommend this location. It was awful! Read more We had a table of 8 and we had great service.  Deep dish pizza and Lou's salad were delicious.  We visited this pizzeria yesterday. Arrived at 7:05 pm (table was reserved for 7) but had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated because as the manager said ""you see we are busy people came in and we seated them"" and for the whole  waiting time, no one from the staff apologized for this situation, never once did they say how long to wait and why, all we heard was ""wait a few minutes"", ""we are busy"", ""it's not our fault that people came, they also need to be seated somewhere"". So we had to wait at the door (8 people) and when we were finally seated, the floor under the table was wet and sticky, more than half of the chairs were the same.  And that's another 10 minutes of waiting until they seat us, to be more precise, after 10 minutes we went and sat down at the table ourselves, since there was no one from the staff in the hall to say that it was clean.  The waiter was friendly and the food was excellent, which somehow smoothed the impression of this place.  However, towards the end, the staff started cleaning up and the chairs creaked a lot when they were pushed around.  It was simply impossible to talk, because we could not hear each other, and the screeching sound was also very unpleasant.  This is our third visit to this place and it looks like our last.  The impression from the manager and the host is simply terrible. Read more A wonderful birthday party experience! The staff was incredibly kind and attentive, and the food was fantastic! I’m glad we were able to have a birthday celebration at Lou Malnati’s Oak Park, and I look forward to coming back in the future! Read more I wish i could remember the name of our wonderful server - she was great!  The food was so good.  We had calamari, which tasted so fresh; wings - so crispy and the sauces were dee-lish!

Such a fun night with my two adult children!! Read more First time being at this location, they took a while to get us seated even if we had a reservation,
The food wasn’t what I hoped it would be, undercooked pizza was a problem but we pushed through it given the circumstances it was 8pm and it was a busy area for all restaurants. The waiter was very polite and kind Read more Typical slow service, decent food but table sticky and needed better cleaning  A Chicago classic. Having moved from Chicago, coming back for pizza is a joy.  Due to traffic, we actually ended up at Lou Malnati’s West Loop…therefore, this review is associated with our West Loop experience.

And…add the tasty Malnati Salad, and one thus has an incredible Chicago Deep Dish  restaurant experience!!! Read more Excellent server.  Food would have been five stars, but don’t understand that if you order your largest wing platter for an appetizer, you can’t get half and half on the sauces. Has to be on the side.   Different flavor profile when on the side.

Excellent service though. Read more Read more Service was great food was great, just a bit of a wait but the waitress were kind and nice.

Food was good as well and since this was a weekday, it was a relatively quiet and relaxing time. Read more Service was great. The pizza was a bit overcooked. The family salad was delicious!  Our server was fantastic and did a great job for us. We had 4 adults and 3 kids age 3, 2 and 1.  When I was planning my trip to Chicago, I knew I had to try the legendary Chicago-style deep dish pizza. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The sauce alone was out of this world. As a pizza enthusiast, I have high standards, but the combination of sauce, cheese, and slices of sweet sausage came together in a way that felt like it was destined to be.

It's as if it was written in stone tablets and handed down to Lou himself to share with the world. Needless to say, this experience has earned a permanent spot on my list of must-visit locations whenever I'm traveling through the Chicago area or any of their other locations.

Cheers to delicious pizza discoveries! Read more When we were seated, the hostess pointed out that the table was very wet from just being cleaned. It would have been better if she had gotten a rag and dried the table so we didn’t have to sit with a wet table and wet menus.

The hostess is awful, the manager is awful, the server is awful.  Never coming back.  Stay clear.  Look at their bathrooms, that just tell you how disgusting the rest of the place is.  Gross. Read more Service was horrendous. Took 20 minutes f0r a server to greet us and 30 minutes to get a beverage. This was WITH a reservation!! Bartender doesn't have a clue  Service was not good. Server delivered one of our pizza’s and admitted he forgot to put the other one in. He stated he was going to put the other one in right away and speak to a manager about rushing it through. At the same time I ordered another glass of wine. About 25 mins later when my kids had finished their pizza I flagged down our server to ask about the other pizza and wine. He admitted that he had still not entered either and wasn’t sure if he could find his manager. I told him to enter both now and to please track down the manager. Eventually we got the pizza and wine. Pizza was cold but we ate some of it anyway. I asked for the check and nothing was offered to us for the admitted errors. I just paid the bill as is and left. Will not be returning to this restaurant anytime soon. Read more This Oak park location is absolutely terrible.  Sadly this will probably be our last time dining in.  Management is terrible.

Great music I was singing the whole time while I dined. Cant wait to go back. Thank you for the amazing experience  Been to Barcocina a few times and have had a blast every time  This restaurant was recommended by our Air BNB hosts and it really delivered!  Food was delicious, people watching was great and the patio was AMAZING.  The only thing I'd warn potential customers - the restaurant has a very young, hip crowd so the music was very loud.  This worked GREAT for my 23 year old son and 24 year old nephew, but not so much for my 81 year old mother.  Get ready for more of a bar vibe than a quiet restaurant and you'll have a great time! Read more It’s a pretty place on the outside and inside. but tacos nasty , drinks water down fr , and customer service is very poor. My waitress took her slow sweet time bringing me out the items I asked for after my food came out so by the time the my other stuff came my food was cold already and mind y’all she didn’t even bring the items I asked for back to the table she sent another server over to bring it instead all because that was my second time reminding her I needed sour cream , straws and my other bowl of tortillas they never brung out. Smh I would never go back at least not to this location. And can’t forget they charged me $4 for a very small side of sour cream. I was very disappointed I do not recommend but to each it’s on. Read more Excellent service for our large party of 20! Love the neighborhood spot for delicious tacos and great atmosphere.  Outstanding service. We had a large group and Barcocina was easily able to accommodate with outdoor seating on a large couch. We received fantastic service from our waiter and the support staff. I love their cocktails, I would highly recommend the ""When I Met You in the Summer"" as it is delicious and packs a bunch. I was recommended to get the shrimp tacos and they were excellent. Love this place. I will say be warned there are 3 nearby train stations, which is ideal for travel, but loud as hell when you are seated outside. Read more Drinks were great. 

Service was slow. Good server, just does not appear to be enough waitstaff. 

The food was mediocre at best. None of the items ordered were prepared as described in the menu. The ingredients and flavors of our tacos were not the best quality and we wouldn’t get them again. Guacamole was very good. 

Nice high energy atmosphere. Read more I went to Barcocnia recently and it was a brutal experience. I arrived early and was told I would have a 90  minute limit on the table - which was totally fine, I waited until our actual reservation time and my friends arrived - we were a party of 6. When we were seated we were told only outdoor tables were available even though I had made a reservation weeks earlier. It was one of the hottest days of the year so that was really disappointing since the reservation obviously didn't say anything about being outside. Then it became very obvious that a massive storm was coming imminently, folks were still being seated outside. I've never heard of a restaurant seating folks on the patio with a reservation without any warning when booking that that could happen. Then once we finally were able to get inside and it was total chaos, our server never came after asking multiple people. They finally took our order about 1 hour after our reservation time. Then everyone's tacos came except for mine (I know they come out as they are done but everyone was fully done eating before my food arrived). Overall, it was an extremely frustrating experience and while I love the vibe at Barcocina I was super disappointed. Read more Food was not good, sadly. And waitstaff neglected to help let us know when they were out of certain drinks.  It was every enjoyable me , friends,and family spent my birthday here and it was very enjoyable  Read more Server was very friendly and had no problem with him, but it was a bottomless special and in 2 hours no one got more than 2 drinks because the service was slow. It didn’t feel like it was worth the money at all Read more The cocktails were great, the patio was lovely, and the server's recommendations were all lovely. I got the shrimp tacos and they were quite delicious, as was the barcocina guacamole, and dulce de leche cinnamon roll for dessert. The atmosphere can be a bit loud, but on the patio it was much more tolerable. Overall I would go again. Read more Went for drinks with my friend and sat at the patio! Was super good and fun vibes. Highly recommend for a nice warm day.  food portions are small for the price. server was not very friendly, but the patio was great. good drinks, decent value  There was a fight in the street right next to the restaurant, the food was very good, but the street fight was a little off-putting  Good food, good environment. What held them back was the bait and switch we had happen to us regarding the margarita flight deal offered on Tuesday by a girl on instagram named Ken. They promoted the big glass flight for free when you say Ken and then brought over tiny glasses. Read more Waitress was great, there is a really cool lunch deal where you get guac or salsa, a salad and 2 tacos. Felt very satisfied and had a great time on the patio!  Friends and I came by since we saw a promo on Instagram. Ended up being significantly less than advertised, and we sat 1.5 hours before placing our food order. It then took an additional hour for the food to come. Read more It was overall an ok experience. It was a super busy night and they were clearly understaffed. The wait staff was very nice though. The margaritas were good and the guac was great  My friend and I made reservations here after seeing a fun promo for a free margarita flight with purchase of food.  Our server stated that it was one flight per two people; however, the promotion didn’t mention that anywhere.  My friend and I agreed to share the flight.  We put in our order of an app and tacos.  Our server was unsure if the app was available saying he thought it had sold out but that he would check for us.  Thirty or so minutes later when our flight arrived we asked about the app and he said that it was not available so we ordered a different one.  Thankfully the app came out quickly and it was delicious (it was a truffle guacamole).  We assumed the tacos would be coming out shortly after since it had been quite a while since we ordered.  We were seated at 7:30 and did not receive our meal until 9:50.  My friend flagged the server down around 9:30 bc he hadn’t been by to check on us and I feel that’s the only reason we ended up getting our tacos.  I’m not sure if the promotion overwhelmed the restaurant or if it was our servers fault but it was a completely unacceptable wait time.  Thankfully all we ended up paying for was the app because the manager decided to comp our meal.  The vegetarian tacos were very good and I would like to try them again but maybe not on a promotion day. Read more Read more Never got to eat dinner.

Food quality always on point. Drinks are amazing. Great dining experience!  Great Chicago feel. Service was Superb! My only complaint was the quality of the food was good but you can get better quality in the area at a much cheaper price. My date and I had 2 drinks each, each got a steak and a side and shared a lobster tail. 
My side was mushrooms for my steak but not marinaded or sautéed in wine or anything but olive oil. Lacked flavor. The lobster was good size but the butter was not flavorful. 

All in $600 with tip. Not worth it. Read more Always excellent service and highest quality food. We had both seafood and steak and both were wonderful.  Gibsons is always a place to go for wonderful food and a wonderful atmosphere.  Read more We were there for a birthday celebration, as we normally do.  Quality of the food was outstanding.  That being said, prices were outrageous. Prices have increased a number of times over the past year. Also, we always order Veuve Cliquot champagne. Restaurant was out of that brand. Disappointing.  We were expecting to order the extra large lobster tail, but it was not available. Disappointing, but probably a good thing.  The 20 0z lobster tail was extremely expensive and way overpriced, though delicious.  In the past, the large lobster tail came with vegetables as an included side.  It no longer does.

It took a few minutes for our server to realize he was responsible for our table but once he did, he was great and attentive. We will be back!  Bad service, long time to eat, would not go again.  If you eat here, make sure you have plenty of time to wait. We arrived for a 5:15pm reservation & told our server we had tickets for a 7pm show and wanted to make sure we’d be finished by 645. She said wouldn’t be a problem. Our drinks and 3 appetizers came quickly, but all of the food was cold-not even warm. The sprouts were served in a cast iron skillet that my spouse easily picked up with bare hand to pass around the table. We were with hungry kids so ate everything anyway.
We finished appetizers by 5:50 then we waited. And waited. At 6:10 I asked the server when we could expect our food. And again at 6:20. At 6:25 a manager came over to say he’d check and came back to tell us our ticket was third in line. I asked how long it would take for our ticket to get to front and he said it took 5 min per ticket (so 6:40pm best case just to get our food cooked) and would that be ok. No, it wouldn’t since we had tickets for 8pm show, and we asked for the check.
I’m not sure what happened here or why the kitchen hadn’t even started cooking our food when we’d put the order in nearly an hour ago.

The server and manager were nice enough and we received a discount for the drinks/apps we had received but it was a bummer over all. Unlikely that we will return.

Great and extensive cocktails and happy hour  This spot never ceases to amaze me. The space is gorgeous. The food is always on point. And the staff is warm and inviting. Can’t wait to return  The hummus plate and beet puree plate were EACH $20!!  The tuna crudo contain very little tuna NOT seasoned with some snall pieces of charred avocado and a store bought bottled salsa.   That was $23.  Fortunately each item was half price under happy hour.  The olive oil cake was $14 and DRY.  Best item on the menu that we had was the warm pita bread.

Food and service were excellent!   Never disappoint!  The service was a little slow but all in all it was nice  Very very noisy music. Good food but not great for conversation.  The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful interior and decor. Vibes were also great with DJ setting ambiance. The food was disappointing and not very good. If you are going for brunch the brunch menu is interesting and does not have a lot. Got shakshuka, cinnamon roll, steak and eggs and chicken and gravy. Shakshuka was good and so was the cinnamon roll. The chicken was bland and so was the gravy and peas were a weird addition.  Steak was chewy and only came with a egg yolk sauce and yogurt. No other accompaniments. Cinnamon roll was very good.Mango margarita was also good. Overall this restaurant is mainly for the aesthetic Read more Read more The Pace is just Drop Dead Gorgeous.  The Staff is just over the top Friendly. The food and Drinks are just Stellar. It doesn't get a y better than Beatnik.  The place is absolutely stunning.

Read more We celebrated my daughter's 25th birthday during brunch at Beatnik. We love the atmosphere and thought it would be very festive. The service was very good, with our waiter bringing water right away (it was a bit warm inside with the roof open on a very hot Chicago day). We ordered a round of drinks and just talked for awhile before ordering. 

For appetizers we got an Avocado Toast and a cinnamon roll - both were outstanding! For brunch, others got the egg sandwich and a double cheeseburger - plus the fries! All were very good! 

My only disappointment came with the cocktails.  All were $17 and up and served in very small glasses - my son's drink came in a small coupe glass with the others (margaritas) in small rocks glasses. For the price, they were too small and very average in taste. 

Otherwise - the visits was wonderful and we would go back again for the food and ambience! Read more Our Server Sam was amazing !! He was so hospitable and helpful.  Nice aesthetic. Service was poor - did not get much attention. This was our first time, and asked the server how many dishes he would recommend for a couple. He recommended 5-6 dishes. We ordered 5, and went home with about half the food - way too much. On top of that, they brought out every dish almost simultaneously, so our table was PACKED with food, and by the time we tried our final dish it was cold. And on top of that, the food was very mediocre. Overall, would not come back. Read more The ambiance in this restaurant is amazing! Good portions were perfect - not too big, not too small - and everything tasted delicious. Happy hour menu with discounted pricing on drinks and food made this Friday night outing a great value too! Read more Food and service was perfection. Tried their baba ganoush, cheeseburger, fries, and steak and not one dish disappointed. Will definitely go back!  Enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch in the front room with skylight roof for a bright, open feel.  Loved the decor/vibe and sitting on one of the big couches surrounded by lots of pillows.  Shared the mezze plate (delicious) and split the breakfast burrito (yum).  Very relaxing meal with friends.  Will return soon and do it exactly the same way!

Enjoyed dining in NYC location several years ago and was looking forward to trying in Chicago, unfortunately it was a disappointing experience.   Our meal started with an appetizer which did not arrive. After asking our server, we found out he never put in the order. He became very defensive, even though we said it was not a big deal.  After that server was very unfriendly, he made no offer to place the order or even acknowledge the error.   Meals arrived and a two of them were not good.  Gnocchi was dense and doughy and pesto sauce was not good.  Sauce on cacio e pepe was watery. Filet dinner was good.  Server was absent and never checked to inquire about meals.  Server seemed annoyed when we ordered desert.  After that he did not say another word to us even when he brought our check.  I understand it was a busy night, but had made reservations a couple of weeks ahead and there was no excuse for the service failure. Read more Great restaurant; food, vibe, service! Everything we ordered was delicious!  Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to expectations. The food was not good at all, and the portions were quite small.

The food was good and the service was amazing! We had non-alcoholic beverages and they were delicious!  Beautiful patio and excellent service with tasty food  We had a very nice time at The Table at Crate.  The food was excellent as was our server.  Read more Gone many times, always different. IMO, this is a great room searching for a better restaurant. Hostess was a gem. Seated us and our well-behaved Lab in a corner table. Brought water and a treat. Thumbs up. Waiter was raw. Fun, personable, knew how to work the clientele, but raw. Loved his positive personality, but doubt anyone trained this poor kid. One of the best things I have seen in any restaurant, lit a candle for a woman's birthday, she blew it out, he relit it and said, ""I'm giving you a second wish!"" 9/10 creativity. The food server was fun to watch as he was reminiscent of the Soup N@zi on Seinfeld. He would go table to table brusquely dispatching plates after barking out what they held. Nothing more, nothing less. I'd have thrown in an ""enjoy"" for good measure. Though I understand the difficulty places are having getting workers. More places, fewer candidates.

The offerings continue to surprise me. The price point for what you are receiving defies logic other than the ""we-have-a-captive-audience-at-an-upscale-mall-and-no-one-will-care"" model. We started with hummus which, for $14, was surprisingly hummus free. Seemed like a swipe on the plate like chefs did back in the early 2000s. Plenty of raisins, though, and a merely inoffensive pita. Has to be a profit driver. Then came the two pitas with chicken. For $22 each, they were surprising lite of chix thigh. Maybe 3 ounces each. I thought about ordering a side of commissary-made waffle fries, but even I could not justify the $10 price for what appeared to be a small bowl. 

A 9 oz pour of rose was confusingly priced at $21. Granted, that's more than 1/3 of a bottle, but when it retails between $17-22, you wonder why gulpable rose is at that cost. Up drink was miniature in the big glass (available at the store, BTW), and the old-fashioned was lacking any discernible bourbon flavor. If you like them sweet, this is for you. 

All in all, I love the place, but hate the tariff. Solid thumbs sideways. Read more Food is always kinda a let down and small portions.  My noodles tasted good but for $27 I would expect more than 3 little shrimp.  The burger was not good and very small.  Don’t even bother. What on earth was Crate and Barrel thinking opening a restaurant? The food was not good and the service was terrible. Lots of other choices in the Mall.  Karen was great as our waitress.   The spicy fried chicken is based on an Asian approach and is fantastic!!  Creative dishes and cocktails. Service was excellent . Highly recommended.  Was there for lunch.  This was my first visit and i will definitely be back.  Everything was excellent.  We started with the tomato goat cheese app and it was just wonderful - great flavor combo.  Main course was the burger and the chicken wrap, both were cooked to perfection.  We finished with the banana bread pudding and it was good, but the caramel ice cream was superb.  I did not enjoy the coffee, it tasted old and bitter.  Overall i loved the place.  Our server was fantastic, she did a great job taking care of us.  The restaurant is beautiful, had a fun vibe.

I think it was the kitchen more than our server. Started to get a little noisy as time went on  We decided to have pre-theater dinner at the Walnut Room.  A touch of nostalgia and a great pre-theater location.  We were seated in the Walnut paneled area near the windows ""to view the city"".  They didn't plan on the sun going down early (it was October) and there wasn't enough light to read the menu.  Service was is and probably will always be - SLOW.  We planned ahead and had given ourselves and extra 1/2 hour before curtain. 
To the food:  The classic Chicken Pot Pie was goopier than remembered and the Meatloaf glaze was way too sweet.  The green beans were sautéed in beef fat and had an off taste.

It's lovely, a pleasant place to go for lunch and steeped in history, but the service is so slow and all the beautiful touches that once were Marshall Fields are gone (the finger sandwiches, the Frango's after lunch, the strawberry iced tea).

Have the wait staff or menu mention it for proper ordering.  This was our second visit to Mantra and, like the first, we were impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food. Salads were fresh, qualities plentiful and seasoning done right (Caution: for some, the food might be spicy, but it is prepared as it should be). The only issue here is that the courses are served very quickly, sometimes too quickly. My husband is diabetic and usually takes an insulin shot between courses. Though we asked them to hold the entree for a few minutes when we placed the order, entrees were served while he was taking his shot. In addition, there is a tendency to bring things ""as is,"" so I had to send my salad back as I asked for the dressing on the side.

We’ve been going to Mantra for several years now. The food, the setting were always good. This time, unfortunately, was a real disappointment. The service was well not “service.” Our cocktails took ages to come, and the waiter kept pressing us to order our food, which we were t going to do until we started our drinks. When we ordered a bottle of wine, I specifically pointed to the one we wanted. They brought the red Seeker not the Reisling. They went back to get the right wine—took ages—only to come back and tell us they didn’t have it. We ordered a different bottle and when it came it was already uncorked! We ordered lamb vindaloo, which it came much later than everything else and was actually chicken vindaloo. The waiter was not customer-focused. There seemed to be a lot of staff but very disorganized  with noticeable  tension among the staff hierarchy.  The food was still good but the chicken in the tikka masala was dry & bland like it hadn’t been even cooked in the spices or sauce.

Special shoutout to Vamshi who took care of us the other night  One of the best Indian places in the entire Chicago area. So amazing! A must for locals and visitors.  There is a no meaning for table book.You are making fool as manager didn’t want to know that I booked table before he give me a random table although I write that It’s my special day.
Waiter always rooming around us for order we enter at 8:00 and he want order at 8:05 means he just want that empty this table for next person. We were eating our appetite and he place all main menu item and then again waiting for us to finish that thing early.
THE main thing is we order and he didn’t give us that thing and he knows that he not gave that thing because it’s not in the bill and after I told he want to give me that thing as a compliment means thay all do that thing with all people.I drove for 1 and half hour from my home for that experience…wow… Thanks for the service. Read more Food and the flavors are very good, as is the service. However, they need to find a way to get the food to the table while it is still hot, not lukewarm.

Definitely going back!  Expensive, but fortunately the quality of the food matches the price.  Everything was good with restaurant especially with the food. Service was okay it took them like 15 mins to get my drink when I ordered it when my meal came. Also the waiter never got my check so the manager had to bring me the check Read more Great place! Good food, not as authentic as expected but overall a nice place to have peruvian food  El restaurante es muy bueno, sin duda de nuestros favoritos. Todos los platillos y bebidas estuvieron excelentes  Un lugar con excelente comida, servicio y ambiente  For many years Tanta has been a wonderful restaurant with excellent food and servers who were thoughtful and proud of the cultural heritage they represented.  Today  in our experience it is none of those things. Quite ordinary in fact. So goodbye Tanta! We will remember the good days. Read more Went for brunch for a girls day outing. Sat outside on the rooftop. Beautiful weather and nice ambiance. Service was very good. It was really windy and the umbrellas kept falling. But staff made sure to check on people and even moved us to a different table. They tried their best to secure the umbrellas so no one would get hurt. Food was so good, we were so full. And bottomless mimosas were great,  but very dangerous. Had so much fun! Read more Unbelievable expensive! A Branzino dish $75?! The food is good but extremely highly priced.  I used to love Tanta about 5-7 years ago. Unfortunately it has really gone downhill. The interior furniture and decor is incredibly dated and out of style. The ambiance is no longer trendy and the lights are as bright as an operating room. I was excited to return here but won’t be coming back until after they renovate in January. Food is still very good, but vibe isn’t worth it. Bummer! Read more Read more I LOVE Tanta! The food is always amazing! The ambience is phenomenal! I will always frequent Tanta!  Really noisy background music with Base sound making conversation difficult! Some excellent food items especially the Tuna but some others like the rare steak with a quails egg on top was chewy and especially mediocre and goes against the very concept of the dish! The cocktails are very mediocre! Had the flaming lips but the Rum used was low quality and harsh versus smooth! Also a dinner for two came to $ 180 which is very expensive given the hit or miss quality of the food and cocktails! Service was attentive and accommodating ! Overall if you are in your 20s and looking for a loud and hip place with mediocre food and cocktails this might be your choice! Read more Everything was so flavorful! Both cocktails and appetizers.  Overall a nice Peruvian place. Service is great. The food is well presented - I do think some of the dishes lack a bit of flavor. The empanadas are great.  We had reservations at 8:15 but weren’t seated until closer to 8:30 which is fine! Our server McKenzie was great! Very informed on the menu and even surprised us with dessert for my birthday! We had the ceviche, lomo saltado, and empanada trio and it was all very delicious! Love coming here for special occasions!! Read more The food was amazing for the price. the ambiance was perfect! The staff was on point!! Love love this little gem... will be back !!  Excellent ceviche, mussels were cooked perfect with delicious sauce  Great food and a good vibe.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Way way way too loud. 
In combination with communication problems engendered by differences in native languages, this resulted in service problems that otherwise would not have existed.

Also, your 90 minute time restriction on those couples who eat at your restaurant on Saturday night is unrealistic given your service limitations with a full restaurant. We took dessert to go rather than take a risk of being told to vacate the premises. Read more Excelente food, drinks, and service…a Chicago treasure  Read more The waitress, Paula, was extremely rude—it's the first time in my life I've ever been treated that way by a server.

I am a big food of peruvian food and the food you get there is not any less that what you get in Peru  The overall experience was quite positive, as it usually is. While the quality of some dishes may not fully justify their prices.The atmosphere was somewhat loud, which may be a consideration for individuals who are sensitive to noise. Read more Peruvian is one of my favorite cuisines and Tanta did not disappoint! We explored a variety of dishes - cebiche trio, tuna tartare causa, empanadas de tamal, chaufa aeropuerto, churrasco, and yuca fries. Every single item was delicious, fresh, and craveable. The timing of the plates was done well, allowing us to work our way through the dishes without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.  The server was fantastic, friendly and available  but not over solicitous. Read more Another great experience, in all aspects. Tanta is always a great choice!  Happy hour ended just before we arrived.  Ceviche was day of, I wished it had a little more time to cure.  Great drinks and friendly staff.  This was my second time here. Honestly it was one of the best dining experiences I have had in years, and in my opinion of the finest restaurants in all of Chicago. The dishes are brilliantly conceived and prepared, especially their seafood items. My party each had two drinks, a small plate, and an entree. We shared everything. Every single component of our meal and drink I would rate a 10/10, which I don’t say lightly.

Pizza was excellent, but we wished that there had been more sausage. We knew the wine so it was fine.  Extremely rushed service at every level…value is going down…becoming a bit of a disappointment  The pizza was delicious and so was the chicken parm sandwich. The fries that came with the sandwich were dry, which is weird for fries. They must have been old but kept hot.
Our server took our order and disappeared. We asked the person who brought our food for peppers and salt but never got them. I finally got up and got them myself.
The pizza is the best at Roberts but after a lot of visits I’m finding out that they really don’t care about the service.

Service was great thank you for being another great staple in Chicago’s food scene. Read more Not Chicago style, just very average pizza with an above average price, in a very loud space.  Por ser la noche previa a la maratón en Chicago, había mucha gente y el servicio fue demasiado lento. Adicionalmente, nos enteramos al salir que había un menú especial para participantes en la carrera señalada, adecuado para sus necesidades. La mesera nunca lo mencionó y lo más probable es que hubiéramos ordenado algo de ese menú ya que participamos en el evento.

Lovely relaxing atmosphere due to the fabulous location on the edge of the water Ogden slip.

I don't understand why reservation and walk in queue together, maybe because it was not so busy.

would return Read more Great flavor and NY style thin crust. Great sauce flavor   Touristy pizza place. Great if you are going on a river cruise and want a before or after meal. Great outdoor seating right on the canal. Pizza is decent.  Very disappointed. Reserved a table outside for a special occasion only to be seated inside and treated rudely by the hostess. Our waiter forgot multiple items in our order, and everything took a really long time. I will likely not be coming back anytime soon. Read more Excellent food and considering they were so busy service was good.  Loved it! Great neighborhood restaurant…pizza so huge we had to split it along with a lovely bottle of wine.  Such a great, laid-back vibe! The owner, Robert, and his wife were sitting at the bar and were both very friendly. Robert made a point to walk around and check in with tables, which showed how much he genuinely cares about his customers and the food they serve.

I’m gluten-free, and this was honestly one of the best gluten-free pizzas I’ve ever had. Robert mentioned they import the gluten-free flour from Italy, and it definitely made a difference! The rest of my group ordered regular pizza, but after trying mine, they agreed it was really delicious. I’d highly recommend it and will definitely be back! Read more Amazing pizza! The weather was beautiful and we sat outside and enjoyed the river view. The service was excellent and Robert even came to our table to check how everything was. Definitely a place I would visit again. Read more We love this place and the food is outstanding!  We always order the apple/hazelnut salad and the veggie pizza. Every time we are in town we make sure we stop by this restaurant! Service is always en pointe too!! Read more We love Robert’s. Great pizza and salads. Staff is welcoming and very personable.

When we ordered, my wife in addition to saying “Detroit J” pointed it out on the menu to our (very nice) server. She even said that the Detroit pizzas take longer, about 20 minutes.

Tonight was a service fail. Our server got our order wrong. A manager came over to apologize but then flubbed it. He said, “you pointed to the wrong menu?” He led with this? Basically saying it was our fault? Never mind that the Detroit J pizza is on a physically separate menu which my wife was holding. Rudeness with a smile?

So, in addition to waiting 15 min for the wrong pizza we waited another 20 minutes for the one we’d ordered.

No guest recovery beyond a backhanded accusation veiled as an apology. Cmon, Robert’s, we love you guys but this was amateur.

One person must eat gluten-free free & the pizza was outstanding!  Great menu options for all tastes and preferences. Nice appetizer menu (excellent arrancini, chicken wings, calamari).

Read more We came here after a Bears game and it was awesome! I wish that they would’ve had room for our party outside, but the ambience was really cool and the food was fantastic  The mussels are so so so good. (And the pizza)! Definitely recommend! They have a brunch/ lunch menu until 2 that doesn’t include some of the items on the “all day menu”. FYI :)  Best pizza in Chicago!
Absolutely lovely sitting by the water, too!
Very highly recommended!  Good food. Good atmosphere. Only draw back was feeling like you packed too many people in an elevator but at tables.  Excellent! Some of the best pizza I’ve ever had and great service!  Great outdoor seating.  Great crust.  Innovative combinations.  I ran across this place on a walk through Chicago.  What a pleasant surprise!  This may be the best pizza I have ever had!  Perfect day to eat outdoors. Excellent pizza. Good beet salad. Very good value on special wine offer. Otherwise a little pricey on the wine options.

￼  William Murphy and Russell Kook have brought this place back to life! Amazing service and food!   Julia our server was great ! Bar was super crowded and she showed grace under pressure !!  We chose this restaurant for its outdoor seating and because it was a perfect day for brunch. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing from the start. The check-in staff were neither friendly nor welcoming, and our server had a similar lack of warmth, which set an uncomfortable tone.

When I ordered a mimosa, the staff seemed unfamiliar with the drink and instead brought me champagne. After I clarified my order, they appeared confused. The food, when it arrived, was bland and lacked flavor, and part of my order was forgotten altogether.

Things have definitely improved a lot since Chef Russell came on board.  The menu has undergone significant changes and continues to evolve, and the service feels more elevated and refined now.

When we were there a few months ago, our server informed us they would be changing the menu soon and making other improvements, so we were very excited to get the ladies of our family together for a summer High Tea yesterday. We were so disappointed in the quality of food and service that I'm not sure we will be back! The menu has changed--and not for the better. Scones are small. No clotted cream anymore. Sandwiches were a bit tasteless. Cucumber sandwiches had such thick slices of cucumber they were falling out of the sandwich. Same with the lox...so thick and falling out of stale bread. No pound cakes  Just little petit fours that were average. They used to ask if they could refill any empty trays. Not this time. 

They used to have such delicious sandwiches and sweets. I desperately miss the curry chicken salad, which was my absolute favorite.

Hot water refills for our tea pots was hard to come by and our server spent more time trying to sell us extra beverages from the bar. 

Less food. Poorer quality of food. Poorer service--for nearly $25 more per person.  Such a big price increase for a lesser experience.  I'm not sure how they can justify such a large price tag. Read more We have been going to High Tea at the Drake for a number of years.  For the first time we were very disappointed.  The service and food were not at the level we were accustomed to.  We have had the same serve previously and he had been wonderful and attentive.   This year he was too busy outside of the Colonial Room with unknown responsibilities than he was inside with his guests. Read more Lovely setting, good and service. David, our waiter, did all he could to make our time there perfect. I’d be happy to return there.  We attended the July 3rd experience for the 2nd year in a row. For the price, we thought the food was just OK. By the time you made a plate and got to your seat, most of the hot items were cold indicating they were not that hot when plated.  Buns for burgers were not warmed. Waters were brought to the table but if you wanted anything else non-alcoholic, good luck. The outside space was nice and of course the view for the fireworks was phenomenal. Valet service was fantastic and helped accommodate elderly or special needs guests first. Which I thought was great. Read more This review is for the Independence Day experience at The Drake. Definitely not worth the price. Reservation on Open Table stated ""Price includes all taxes, fees and gratuity"", but we had to pay an additional $44 for those extras when we arrived. This experience was $204 for 2 people and didn't even include soft drinks. I wouldn't do this again. Read more Read more Overall we enjoyed it but won’t be going back. For $75 there should be more food & more tea options. Also service was slow.  I sat for awhile before anyone even came over with water. Also we had to ask to have our food brought to the table. Read more The tea includes a glass of champagne, one selection of tea, two two-bite scones, 4 slices of different sandwiches which tasted like they were made on Wonder bread and all together made up maybe half a sandwich, and desserts that looked and tasted like they were bought at Costco. For $75 a person, we left hungry and unimpressed. You can head on over to almost any restaurant at the Oak Brook Mall and get much better value for your money. Read more The food was excellent; it was a bit pricey.  The service was slow; nobody was there, and it took 15 minutes to get drinks. The bar is gorgeous. We opted to sit outside on the veranda, which was very pretty, but they didn’t even put white tablecloths out there, and the table was shaky.  ￼ It’s definitely worth going there and these are minor fixes.q Read more Not good at accommodating allergies. My daugter has a tree nut allergy and she couldn’t eat anything they had.
They made her a plate of cucumbers and carrots wrapped in lettuce and cucumber and carrot sliced on top of each other. They also gave her some fruit.  Not worth $75 .
The other food was fine. Nothing special. Our sever wasn’t very nice. He barley came to the table. When he was at the table he wasn’t very nice. He seemed in rush. There were only 2 other the whole time we were there.
I was super disappointed because the high tea in their Chicago location is really good. Huge disappointment. Read more Great atmosphere,  food, service and best of all no noise level.  We started in the bar with an excellent cocktail (Lavender French 75)served by a friendly bartender. What a pleasant surprise that Gerry, our bartender, was our waiter in the dining room. His personality and service excellent and the food delicious. He was right there back in the bar when we retired for conversation and an after dinner drink. Gerry created an otherwise pleasant evening into a great memory. Read more Very enjoyable high tea!  Nice champagne and yummy sandwiches and desserts.  Our server was very attentive.  Water both for tea and glasses were filled regularly. He explained the teas and all of the food that was served. We never felt rushed. The room was lovely and the tables set with beautiful tea service. Read more High tea with 7 friends at The Colonial Room was beautiful.  The food and tea was delicious. Tea was high quality.  I thought it was nicer and better quality than the Michigan Ave location which was way too crowded when I attended a high tea a few years back. I highly recommend high tea at The Drake Oakbrook and would attend high tea again. Read more Service from waitress was uneven and not attentive during the meal.

Amazing service :)  We love coming back to the Dawson. The best outdoor patio in Chicago, and food that is tasty and done exactly right. Exceptional service!  This was my first time at The Dawson. We were greeted promptly and politely. We were seated outside, and it was a perfect day. From the delicious cocktails to the very tasty entree evrything was great. The servers were attentive, but not intrusive. If I could give one suggestion it would be a little less of the delicious brisket on the Grilled cheese and little more cheese. The brisket was so plentiful that is overpowered the cheese. So either add more cheese or less brisket. Overall, a very nice experience.

We were told all of the tables are reserved and yet they were all still vacant when we were leaving not to mention we reserved an outside table next to the water, but another host then said that they don’t take reservations for outside tables after the host told us that they were reserved ..￼not to mention the photos online are not accurate with the set up currently they have high top tables covering the whole view of the water and then the little tables behind it so you’re sitting looking at people eating instead of water.

The problems were that she never, ever brought our 4th entree out, and never asked if we wanted another round of drinks or dessert menu. So strange.

The cook did great but the waitress had a bad attitude and mixed up the orders of everyone at our table.  Got there to celebrate my birthday. The hostess told me happy birthday which was great. Sat down and didn’t even get water or have a plate or fork. Ask the waitress for all three. Brought a plate but forgot the water and the fork. Had to ask three times for a fork. Twice for water. Never got my water refilled. My husband was expecting them to sing happy birthday to me like the other tables but nothing. The other tables got more of a show than we did. It was such horrible service and never been so disappointed. The good thing was the food was good but he kept forgetting who had what. Very disappointing birthday lunch ☹️ Read more I was very disappointed. They have seemed to cheapen the experience. Our soft drinks were flat and the replacements only slightly better.

The chef was engaging though he seemed a little bored with the routine. The server did her job adequately, but seemed a bit disengaged and even slightly dismissive. She became much friendlier at the end of the evening after I paid the bill upon my leaving an appropriate tip. At that point it didn't matter much. One way the restaurant needs to be more transparent in the way they charge for rice. I was charged a flat fee for the meal, and then a separate charge appeared for the chicken fried rice. Had I known it was extra, I might have chosen the plain steamed rice unless that was extra too. This practice is lacking in transparency. I did not want to argue so I just let it go. Overall, I was out with a great group of people who don't complain or nitpick so we had a good time. The service could be better and they need more transparency in their pricing. Read more Outstanding food and service always. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars, is it’s a bit too overpriced.  Fun spot for special occasions like birthdays!

My only complaint- they cram you in.  They stuck us with a table of adults that had already been served cocktails and immediately asked our order before even having a chance to sit down. It was me and two kids and I was not able to fully sit on my chair since the others at our hibachi had already claimed their space. Got some attitude when I asked to be moved- which they eventually did and we were seated with a friendlier family at the same time so our orders were synced and not rushed. Other groups around us arriving later asked for more space too.

That’s inexcusable for a pre-sliced steak where they could plainly see it was overcooked in the kitchen but sent it out anyway. The manager told me they purposely under season the steak because some people like it that way and the rest can use the salt and pepper shakers at the table to season it themselves. A $65 steak should be properly seasoned and if you expect me to add any salt myself you should give me some proper finishing salt, not a salt shaker of iodized table salt.

Muy buen restaurante!

He went around the table  greated everyone   The staff was  great, our server Sabrina, was great & took very good care of us. Read more A little too loud by the bar. The music didn’t make it easy to chat but the food was magical  We discovered this restaurant from searching around on Maps, and wanted to give it a try. I give a lower star for ambience because there was a live band for a private event in the back and it was extremely loud. After they were done, it was better but still pretty loud. 
Food was awesome. We had tacos and enchiladas between the 4 of us. The seasoning on the ground beef is excellent. Chicken was a little bland in the tacos though. Salsa was top notch. We ordered margaritas, and the flavor was off a little. 
I can't say the value is there. It's hard to say I'm happy to pay $120+ for a family of 4. But we will be back. Read more the food, drinks, staff, vibe was just all amazing. definitely coming back  Delicious food and drinks.  Service was excellent and attentive to our needs.  Atmosphere is festive and lively.

The men's room is very small for the size of the restaurant. 

Service was ok. Read more We went for our anniversary and we were pleasantly surprised with the additional touches that our server made. We had a great server and would highly recommend this place for special occaisions. Read more The restaurant is very nice, waitstaff was pleasant and the food was exceptional!  The food was amazing.   I recommend any of the oyster dishes and the wings.   The service was perfect.   We all had a wonderful time there and will definitely return!  This was our second time eating here and it was fine.  The Brussel sprouts were outstanding.  My husband's lamb chops were overly salty. I had the scallops which tasted fine but I expected 4 or 5 scallops.  Three scallops is a bit skimpy for an entrée.  The service was fine. Read more The food was amazing! We started with the wings and did not expect them to be as tender as they were. The chicken fell right off the bones, and they were so light and easy to eat! We didn’t think we’d eat them all, because you get a decent serving size. But we couldn’t stop since they were so fresh and hit the spot.

Then we had the salmon for dinner and the honey glaze was amazing! I didn’t want to finish it, because I wanted to savor every bite. It was a perfect size and cooked very well!

Compliments to the chef! We will definitely be going back. Read more It was very delicious and the service was awesome. Charging 3% on  every credit card bill is ridiculous considering every bill is at least $100. Who carry that amount of cash and they charge the waitstaff 3% on their tips. Read more Food was really good! Luis was attentive and got us in and out in a reasonable time. Can't wait to go back and try something else.  Great food and service. I was disappointed to be seated upstairs as it has a much different ambiance from downstairs. I had an 11:30 am reservation, downstairs was empty and they took us to the bar upstairs. I work in the building and come here often but not sure I’ll be back. Read more Great food, love the ambiance-great for after work drinks!  Read more Great food and friendly atmosphere. Great for groups of 8 or less.  Zac was a great server.  The rest of the place was awful.  When we got there for my wife's birthday, they didn't have a table for us and we made a reservation and included it was her birthday.

They wanted to seat us at the Chef's counter which didn't look like it was cleaned for awhile.  They finally sat us at a booth for 6 people that was sort of in the kitchen, a way from the dining room.  You would think this might be a good seat to watch the chef's cook.  NOT!  Instead we got to watch three managers do there paperwork at the chef's counter and eat their food and frankly do nothing to help run the restaurant.

The food was OK  The Steak Frites would have been amazing if it didn't come out raw.  TWICE!  Do you think one of those manager's standing there came over to inquire.  NOPE!  Too busy eating their Frites.  They were very addictive.

We're from Cleveland and were really looking forward to eating at Jonathan Sawyer's restaurant.  If it keeps getting run like this, it won't be there the next time we are in town. Read more Food was delicious and atmosphere as well. Size of proteins to add to salads are too small  Great food!  Fun atmosphere! Plus easy access to train station.  Overall experience was great - just a few hiccups with my order that prevents me from giving much experience five stars.  This was my 2nd time at Kindling, 1st time for @valeria.pruett. Every dish and cocktail has been really good to excellent. Then food is creative and flavorful, usually kissed by the open fire. Similarly, the cocktails are balanced and tasty. Most places make cocktails sweeter than we like. Kindling’s, if not quite as dry as I would make them, are definitely restrained in sweetness.
The confit chicken wings are unique. Duck is the most common poultry prepared confit (a long, slow cook in fat or sous vide) but it’s great for chicken, too, giving a silky tenderness to the meat. These seem to have been crisped quickly over the fire and tossed with a flavorful jalapeño, garlic and lime sauce. 
The quesadilla was stuffed with grilled chicken, black beans and cheese and served with a chipotle-lime crema. The tortillas were also crisped over the fire. Excellent
Foie gras with fruit is a classic. Kindling’s Foie Gras Tartlet combined creamy foie gras mousse with an very flavorful strawberry jam in a crisp tartlet shell. I would make them with a little more mousse and a little less jam, but they were decadently good.
I had tried the Cochinita Pibil, a traditional pork BBQ dish from Yucatan. Valeria ordered it and loved it. Warm, flavorful pork, pickled onions, creamy avocado, and a smoky salsa wrapped in a warm tortilla is a bit of Mexican heaven.
I tried the burger. Generally, I prefer smash burgers, but this was an exceptionally well made not-smashed burger. A thick patty, but not ridiculously so, intensely beefy with the wonderful flavor of a burger you grilled in your own back yard. The “special sauce” had a bit of a spicy kick that I was not expecting, but the burger was a classic, really good grilled burger.
If you are old enough to remember how good McDonald’s French Fries were back in the 60s, you may know that they were fried in beef tallow. Beef fat was declared unhealthy and now they are cooked in vegetable oils. Kindling’s tallow-fried fries are outstanding! Read more Had a very nice experience. The food was delicious--my friend and I both chose the chicken and a side of ratatouille. Both items were wonderful. Portions were generous. It's a little pricey but not overly so given the quality of everything, and not compared to other nice restaurants. 
The server was very professional but warm and the atmosphere was great. Possibly a bit quieter than normal because of other events going on, and it was somewhat early in the evening. But all the same, really nice. I would definitely recommend checking it out and I will be happy to return here myself. 
Also they make a wonderful bourbon old-fashioned... Read more Overrated and overpriced. The appetizer was good, NY strip was fair but a poor cut that was tough and chewy in places, and the sides were virtually inedible - particularly the twice baked sweet potatoes. The music selection was annoying. Read more The Italian Beef sandwich is terrific - much better than the usual.  The service was friendly and there when needed without being intrusive.  The cocktails were tasty, though tended to be a bit sweet. Read more We are upstairs which is a very different vibe than the main restaurant. It was loud, there was techno music playing, and service was pretty slow. We loved the food but wish we had had the same experience as downstairs. Read more Read more The food is pretty good but the overwhelming bbq smell that stayed on my clothes and in my hair for the rest of the day is incredibly annoying. I will not be eating there again! It was awful to be in my office smelling like a campfire. Read more Food always great. We had a small booth facing the food prep area so ambiance not as great as usual.  Food was OK for the price. Service was OK. Make sure you read the check as the restaurant charges a 3% credit card fee on top of the total bill.  If you’re contemplating booking….. BOOK IT!

Food and staff are great.  It’s a staple once a week.  Solid business type restaurant.   Good food, atmosphere, and location in Willis Tower.  Good for drinks or casual business dinner.  A great place for a fine meal.  We were sat next to the entrance,  so sadly we did not get to experience the main dining room, which looks lovely from pictures.  Our server was wonderful.  Made us feel welcomed.  I guess charging the customer for credit card fees is a thing now even in fine dining establishments that are charging above market prices for meals.  Overall, I would recommend bringing cash, ask for the main dining room, and making this a stop on your travel itinerary. Read more Very cool to sit at the kitchen counter and be served by the chef! It wasn’t super busy at 6:30 on a Saturday so the kitchen wasn’t crazy. Still cool experience. The food was great. I had the ribeye, which came on a small chip burning platter and you have the choice of whole or cut before you on a plate. I chose the foie gras on top. That was the only disappointment. It wasn’t just fire grilled it was charred too far. The hasselbeck taters were very very good and the appetizer grilled oysters were good. My wife had the tenderloin with wine reduction sauce. It was excellent.  The best was the appetizer Brussel sprouts. Wow!! And it was a good sized bowl. Drinks were nice and the wine pour generous. We would go there again in a heartbeat next time we are in town. Read more They were out of quite a few menu items. what we were able to order was quite good. ￼  Food was great!

They were for sure understaffed, so things took awhile, but we were not in a rush and could tell they were working their butts off. The speakeasy is by far the best ambiance.

We waited a good 15 minutes for a server and I asked her about ordering drinks!!  We were a little disappointed in the service and food. I thought it was very over priced and not great.

We also stood for about 5 min at the host stand before anyone greeted us.

It’s a cool concept, but it needs some work Read more Too cold inside, server was clueless to menu, two of us asked for one beer taster and we received one beer taster with two straws… lol.

Restaurant actually looked like it wasn’t completed. We went at 5pm on a Sunday and it was not busy. Waitress was super nice but I truly hope she was new. She kept forgetting everything, refills took forever, she offered us ketchup when we were done with our meal (odd exchange), and told us twice she would be back with our dessert.

The stay puff marshmallow man s’more dessert was terrible and not worth $18.  The cookie tasted stale. Read more The experience at Sony Wonderverse was exemplary! From the games, to the food, to the staff, everything was next level. My entire family came to celebrate three birthdays will definitely be back again.

I am totally impressed with the facility!  I am a Sony friend and fan. I love Sony products and even worked for Sony as an intern and independent consultant. 

I hope this is a catalyst for other Wonderverse facilities all over the world. And I thank Mr. Kenichiro Yoshida San for bringing the first Wonderverse to the Chicago area. Peace and blessings to Sony! Read more This feels like a cafeteria at high end dining prices and miserable staff at the restaurant just suck. The bartenders were great in both the primary bar and the speakeasy. The food was mediocre at best. I had Thai chicken tacos and when I asked what came with it the server told me rice. It comes with nothing, just “ok” 3 tacos no side, nothing $20. They don’t server bread or salad or soup with your meal not even a side. It’s not Ruth’s Chris it’s a cafeteria it’s loud and not private. Don’t waste your time. The whole place was empty EMPTY pictures online are NOTHING LIKE what the actual place feels/looks like slide from how many empty seats there were. Never again!! FYI the escape room and bartenders in Ghostbusters speakeasy were awesome so there was that but the price of $20/drink was not worth it. Read more Great spot the seating was nice
Food was delicious they serve real fries  Amazing food and and service while at this location  Food was not great. Potatoes were cold. Drinks were bad. Very short pour on the wine. Had to send 2 drinks back. Wait for drinks was long.
The server, who was very nice, took about 25 minutes to take our order causing us to not make our reservation for the VR attraction. Manager was not very helpful. Scolded me and pointed to a little sign advising patrons to make reservations for attractions 75 minutes after dinner reservations. That’s not on the website by the way.
The VR Jumangi was really cool. Get dinner and drinks elsewhere Read more Service was really slow. Our food was like warm and it was way overpriced for for you get in return. No charm to the place.  Cafeteria style food.  Service was excellent. They wanted feedback on our entire dining part of the experience. My dish, the spicy chicken wrap was fine. My wife however got a double patty burger with cooked onions. She told them she would of liked to have more vegetables in it (like lettuce and tomato). They came back with entire plate of sliced lettuce and tomatos.  The cubed fried salmon bites were also great. The speakeasy Ghostbusters bar, The Ghost Trap, is a sight to behold (sorry 21+ only) for any Ghostbusters fan. From the glowing card catalog furniture, the large stack of books, hanging ghost traps, and a nearly fully functional in-wall ghost container and proton packs are just few of the features here.
The arcade is similar to Dave & Buster's but even less games, but try to make up for it with bumper cars area. A separate video game race game area is also there. Oh and a 21+ board game area in the back...no Monopoly or Risk but there are a few party games. $10 for Ghostbuster VR, your choice of standing or motorized chair there. No reservations on that First come first serve. The other attractions cost more but do take reservations. Jumanji escape room and Encharted activities. Gift shop was a pass. How many hoodies does one need? Columbia/Sony movie themed all the way here. Read more The management was amazing and the food was great!  Had reservations for dinner. The appetizers at Wonderverse were delicious.  We got fried pickles and mac n cheese balls.  My Thai chicken tacos, not that great.  And our dining service was terrible.  Got seated and it took a long time to be greeted by our waiter.  Also took a long time for us to get our bill at the end.  My husband had to get up and walk to the hostess and ask her if we could pay up there?  Because we haven't gotten a bill and were sitting there for a long time.  The games are expensive.  They should definitely lower prices.  The Ghost Trap was the best part of Wonderverse.  It's an amazing speakeasy.  Bartenders and people that work there...all they did was talk amongst each other and were probably louder than the guests.  Less chatter more working, I would recommend for the employees.  With how expensive this place is, guests should be treated top notch. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/61325382.webp

Thanks,  Read more Service was very efficient and excellent personality from our server.  It really is a treat to have dinner in an environment in which you don’t have to shout in order to have a conversation with your dinner companion. Excellent food, outstanding service, a relaxed atmosphere and a fair price, all within steps of the Loop’s main attractions. The friend who dined with me drove in from the burbs, parked in the Millennium garage and emerged literally at Remington’s front door. Not sure what more one could ask. Read more Our server Jason (I believe) was absolutely amazing for our dinner last night. Was timely in service, polite & made sure everything was perfect.  Everyone had a steak. A bit salty but overall good value. Mash Potatoes are huge.  I’ve been to Remingtons many times.  I always would get a steak.  I decided to try their rotisserie chicken was very disappointed.  The dish cost roughly between $22-24.  I didn’t ask for all white meat but also not sure if they could have done so.
The chicken breast was impossible to cut with the knife they provided and I couldn’t remove the meat with a fork it was beyond tough. I would expect the meat to be tender and fall off the bone in a restaurant with the caliber of Remington’s.
I’ve had grocery store chicken that far surpassed the rotisserie chicken they offered.  The mashed potatoes were the only saving grace.  I didn’t tell the waiter because I honestly can’t see how they could have improved it a second time.
Remingtons does have phenomenal steaks and my mom loved hers.  Recent health issues require me to stay away from red meat.  There are other food items like a veggie burger I could try.  But “STAY AWAY “ from the rotisserie chicken. It’s like rubber on a plate.  We took a brownie to go and always do. The brownie is truly one of the best.
Overall Remingtons is still a great restaurant.  Wait staff is always attentive and friendly. Read more Food was great. Service was lacking. Came back after having a great experience a few weeks ago. We made a reservation, had people get seated ahead of us, we got stuck at a table in the bar area. Waiter was slow, had to ask for water refills. People that were seated after us got drinks ordered before us and had much more attention. Read more The food was very good. My husband and I tried the tempura rock shrimp and the lobster devil eggs as an appetizer and both were very good. For dinner we had the ribs with spicy BBQ sauce and the salmon. The mac and cheese is amazing!!! I recommend Remington for a nice dinner date. We were shocked at how good the prices were being that this restaurant is on Michigan Ave. Read more Love Remington’s! They have amazing servers as well.  Staff was wonderful. Attentive. The restaurant is beautiful. They don’t have a lot of tables for large groups (we were 8) and they did an incredible job accommodating us. There’s a great private room surrounded by wine bottles that seats 8 people and we loved it. Great wine selection. Read more Excellent service.

Respected sole diner and made me feel welcome.  Read more The location is perfect and the host was pleasant.   Our waiter was extremely informative and a pure delight.   She checked on us to ensure we had everything we needed.  Our server Abbey, was extremely attentive and anticipated our every need. Every meal item we ordered was delish!  Come here all the time. Disappointed with the dinner and service this time. Brought food out at different times and forgot a substitution that was OK’d in advance.  Very accommodating, super location from nearby attractions - good for after work too. Nice menu- something for everyone.  Great food and relaxed atmosphere. Impeccable service.  Even though we were seated with the last reserve-able time this past Saturday night, we were made to feel very welcome. The food was awesome--French dip was perfect. I'm drooling as I recall it now. Read more Our first night in Chicago and determined to stay awake after our 9 hour flight we booked Remingtons based on reviews. The welcome was friendly and we were given a table overlooking the street. Whilst there are some TVs around the bar I would not call this a sports bar (see other reviews) and the food was more gastro pub with options to suit most and prices to match. The thing I remember was the cocktails which were some of the best we had on our trip and whoever mixed my Gimlet gets 5 stars from me. With a couple of glasses of decent California Pinot and a couple of courses + service the bill can mount up. On a Saturday evening the place was busy and service fine.

Read more They were at tentative to our anniversary celebration.  Fabulous place!  We went there for my 70th birthday. We got there at 4:00 and sat in the lounge by the bar for an hour and had cocktails (there were four of us).  The cocktails were varied and delicious. 

Then we sat for a leisurely 2-hour dinner trying as least half the menu. Every dish was perfect with so many different flavors. 

We had a lovely time. Read more Our meal was absolutely fabulous!! Kudos to the magnificent chef!! We shared 3 different tapas and a decadent dessert!! Such a cute place with the friendliest staff!!! Definitely will go again!!!  Phenomenal food and view and easy to get a table right by the window on the 9th floor.  Underappreciated gem, delicious tapas.  Nice bar and all around great experience.  Been here several times, highly recommend. Read more Dined on a Wednesday evening.  Good ambience.  Able to easily hear and talk with my dining party.  Restaurant on 9th floor of building and had a bit of trouble finding the restaurant.  Table was by the window and had a very nice view.  Regarding the meal I ordered a sangria which was ok.  That was the least impressive part of the meal.   Had the Paella de Diablo which I thought was very good.  Favorite part of the meal was the dessert of churros.  That was excellent and would definitely recommend.  Service was friendly and attentive without leaving one feeling rushed.  Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience. Read more Because hotel restaurants might sometimes be a generic experience, El Tapeo exceeded all expectations. The food was perfectly prepared and presented, the wait staff attentive and ready to help make selections. This restaurant fits the saying, ""You get what you pay for.""
In this case, no regrets, can't wait to go back soon! Read more Read more Service was fantastic and the food and variety was excellent  Muy rico todo lo que comimos, las tapas ,la paella los cócteles de 10  Very enjoyable experience as always! We will be back.  Overall good, alcachofa were great, empanadas as well.
Only low point the Patatas Bravas which are the breakfast poatatoes with missing bravas sauce.  I had no idea this restaurant was in a hotel! Haha Good to know! Parking was tough on a Thursday night! Service was lovely. Tapas were tasty especially the Brussels sprouts. Not very busy and died down around 8:30. Overall, enjoyable dinner.👍 Read more Everything we ordered was prepared perfect!
Friendly staff and attentive service.  The restaurant is on the 9th floor of  Le Meridien Hotel with a very welcoming open concept plan. The restaurant itself is small but it's very busy and very lively. All the food we ordered was very good and tasty. I knew it was tapas style but didn't really realize the serving was really small. The 4 pieces of maiz (corn) looked like they were cut from 1/2 of corn on a cobb, and the chicken looked like 3 pieces of scallops. Little pricey for the price but very tasty. Moctails are not bad price and very delicious. The service were excellent, but they seemed a little short of help. The noise level was really up there, I had a hard time hearing my daughter sitting across me. Overall, I would recommend it for happy hour, since most of the people were drinking more than eating. Read more We dined here during Restaurant Week and the portions and quality of food exceeded our expectations. Service was good and not so good.  Several dishes were brought out almost immediately and then we waited a long time for the remaining tapas.  Took forever to get our check.  In the middle of dinner all of the bright lights came on.  We asked for them to be turned down to the level when we arrived and it took quite a long time for that to happen.  The ambience went from comfortable to feeling as if we were in a cafeteria!  This restaurant is a hidden treasure but service needs to improve. Read more Great ambiance and selection!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will definitely be back  Food was undercooked and terribly bland   Sent the food back and second attempt was not much better  Read more Excellent ambiance, trendy atmosphere and the food is amazing!  Been looking for a good Tapas option other than one or two in the near Western 'burbs and was excited about trying El Tapeo. Good location and great views-okay that's a plus. I had to ask our waiter twice about the bottled wine: once on what the prices were other than the provided wines by the glass list which he vaguely verbally inaccurately provided, and the 2nd time for the actual wine menu. He finally provided it. Some of the tapas were delicious, Alcachofa, fried artichoke dish being one of them, no question about it. The Gambas, shrimp were great! However any of the hot tapas were at best, tepidly warm. The Patatas Bravas  was such a dish.  One of the tapas, some type of pork belly,  had a clear liquid in a small container that was poured over the dish. Neither my wife or I could understand what he hurriedly said in regards to the liquid and frankly neither one of us could figure out what was inside the liquid that was meant to highlight the tapas. But this particular type of pork tasted dried out for a few of the cuts, almost like it had freezer burn or similar. We left it unfinished-uncharacteristic of my wife and me. I don't think I've ever written an ""average"" to borderline negative review of any restaurant I've ever been to and wouldn't completely write off El Tapeo. But I would say they've got to up their game for sure. Read more First time eating at El Tapeo, great food, great service, only reason rated noise level was a large group having fun, New Years Eve Eve, understandable , otherwise great.  Very nice experience on a Saturday night. Nice ambiance, delicious food, good wine selection and friendly service.  Food wasn’t bad but not great either. No bread provided. The one included in my plate was burnt not toasted.  Accommodated 6 gluten free people, including using a separate fryer. Our server was super nice about it and the food was amazing!  Wonderful ambiance, food and drinks were perfect!  We were able to chat and hear one another which is a huge plus since so many restaurants are extremely loud. Tables are well spaced so patrons are not on top of each other. Definitely recommend!! Read more Polite staff and great food. Views are amazing. Glad we went  Really good tapas and drinks! The ambiance is a bit stark and quiet——very few customers, music very subdued. For a Friday evening, although it was the Friday after Thanksgiving, not much was happening. Our wait staff was excellent. The bartender was friendly and made us feel welcomed. We sampled a variety of tapas; our favorites were the empanadas, mushroom croquettes and the bacon wrapped dates.

Never disappoints  Food as always is delicious ,servers and workers very polite and courteous  Unfortunately heard a lot of good things and made reservations but disappointed. Service was slow for not being super busy. They had a vendor show happening upstairs and wondering if that’s where servers kept going. Food was room temperature when it came, not much flavor. French toast was very dry. Steak had no seasoning on it. Coffee was good though. We were given the bill, paid cash and never received our change. Never got our dessert we ordered to go, and no receipt. The waitress never came back and couldn’t be found. We stopped at the vendor show and there she was shopping. So disappointed and won’t be returning. Read more I went and had breakfast here it was extremely good. The service was excellent too. Highly recommend you grab something to eat maybe even a date?!  Love all the breakfasts I’ve tried especially the coconut oatmeal. Nellies breakfast special is so unique with the plantains and cooked in sofrito.  Breakfast jibarito is really good as well  I enjoyed the omelet/egg station most of all. The guy working the omelet/egg station was friendly and hard-working. I would have liked to see labels on brunch buffet items. I had no idea what some items were, which left me less inclined to try them. The service was slightly below average. In my opinion, the buffet brunch was not worth the price paid. My Cafe con Leche was not included. However, the OJ and Sparkling Passion Fruit Water my friends ordered was? Both items were not listed on the receipt. Would have been helpful to know what was included and what wasn't. Read more As always, the breakfast and the service is amazing!  The food is awesome!!
The music is great-
Always fun to go to Nellie’s!
Best Avena de Coco Read more We had read a lot about this place and were excited to try it.  There were some good things on the buffet, like the oatmeal, but overall didn’t find it outstanding.  Next time I’d order from the menu and skip the buffet. Read more Good food. Fun time. Good server....very friendly. Oatmeal was delish. Would come back.  Read more The avena de coco is phenomenal the rest of The food was just ok. The service was terrible. Took 35 minutes to get our check, and it wasn’t even our original server. My dad asked for a different mug for his coffee, he wanted black coffee the second time (he originally had cafe con leche), but everyone just turned away and said no. I’m assuming it was because he had to pay ( which we were totally ok with), but they flat out said no and had thee worst attitude in life. There should be more urgency in checking people out so the line isn’t out of the door for a table. This place has soooo much potential, but definitely need to do some staff training. Read more Came in from out of town and was told to visit here and I am glad we did! Fresh and delicious!  The food was awesome!!!! Highly recommended. The staff was friendly.

Amazing as always  We always go for the Jibaritos - delicious! The coconut oatmeal is also great. Not super fast, but the friendly service and great food make up for it.  The food was very good. We had Fried Plaintain Jibarito sandwiches and waffles. Highly recommend both. The restaurant staff is great and very friendly. Fun atmosphere and neighborhood. Read more Mother’s Day brunch 2 stars, we arrived two hours before closing and the food was COLD! They put us upstairs, which required my 82-yr old mother to climb 2 long flights of stairs, no elevator, no accommodation on the main level ￼.
If they had better decorations, it would have made the folding tables and chairs look way better.
We had reservations we should’ve been told in advance, It would be upstairs as we were expecting the main restaurant. ￼

She did order sausage but they gave her bacon instead but it was still very good. I swear they put like 6 eggs or something cause it was a big boy. My jibarito came with a side order of the coconut oatmeal and high key so amazing. They really don’t hype it up for nothing!! Only thing that irked us was that we clearly were not finished eating and the waitress came up and asked us if we were ready for the check like 2-3 times and followed it with “no rush tho…”There were zero tables besides us and we felt like we were being rushed out so that definitely could’ve been better.

We've been here many, many times, and this was by far the most negative experience here. The food was good, as usual (save for the bacon....their ""cooker"" was broken so it was fairly soggy). Typically the servers are on the ball, checking in, refilling juice or coffee etc. Not today. I had to get up and walk to the bar, three times, in order to get a coffee. The server finally brought it over, in a to-go cup! We hadn't finished eating, by the way. I realize post-covid issues area common, but they seemed to be adequately staffed to handle the diners present. Just an off day? I hope so. Read more Amazing food, great brunch options.  Will definitely be back!  The website states that the buffet breakfast is $15.99 a person.  They charged us $23 a person plus they added a 20% gratuity charge because we were a party of 7.  I understand that restaurants automatically add a gratuity charge but it’s usually 15% to 18% at most.  As stated on their website that orange juice is included but they ran out and served us apple juice. There was no syrup for the French toast or waffles.  I had to ask for milk for the two options of dried cereal.  Staff was friendly but not sure I’ll ever go back. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/41983316.webp

The crab Rangoon was good, not too spicy and that was the last thing I enjoyed. We also got the crazy tiger app which wasn’t flavorful and the sauce that came with it made it worse.

Read more The server was good but the music was way too loud, I could not enjoy a conversation at the table nor hear the server at times and heard the table behind us due to them screaming at each other to talk. Drinks took extremely long but food was quick. Pancake tasted sour, not sure if there was a mix up in ingredients or spoiled milk but exchanged for French toast and it was cool. Just didn’t like the music volume, the time it took for drinks to hit the table yet we were rushed to get up from the table while waiting for the last drink to arrive so if those things changed then I think the experience would be great!

A couple of exceptions:

Didn’t care for banana bread pudding!  It’s an overly decorated plate with mainly raw bananas,  granola like crumble, a circular puff (?) and a tiny piece of bread. An underwhelming dessert.

Burrata flatbread was mediocre.  You can never tell if the the melted cheese is Burrata or any other kind.  Why name it Burrata Flatbread?

I was seated directly next to the host stand and witnessed the host offer parties with no reservation outdoor seating.

I spilled water, accidentally, and the insisted they had to clean it up. But the water remained on the slippery floor. The inbetween lunch and dinner menu (at 1pm) was very limited. It took 2 hours, due to extremely poor service. I would Not recommend this restaurant for any occasion. The staff isn’t rude, they just don’t care. For yogurt, ricotta toast, a waffle, and a bagel it was $135 without tip, nothing but tap water was consumed. Overall poor experience, lackluster food, terrible service, in a 4 star hotel river north restaurant. Read more Our brunch was decent.  We had to wait a few minutes for the greeter to confirm our reservation.  What I mean by that is that we were at the desk for about 8 minutes before anyone stopped over.  We were seated on the Terrace, as we reserved.  The food order was taken in a timely manner.  They our waitress became invisible.  It did not look like the restaurant was busy.  I know that we weren't the only ones waiting to pay our checks after we were finished.  All in all, the food was outstanding.  Just wished they paid more attention to the customer. Read more I showed up for my reservation at 8:30. We waited in line for 25 minutes before being seated at 8:55. We were seated at a couch not the counter seating we booked but she walked away before we could speak to her. Then we waited for 25 minutes - in that time no one spoke to us, or brought us water, or took our order. At this point, we walked out. 

This restaurant is super expensive, the view was mediocre and the service was unacceptable.  I’m glad we didn’t even eat here because it would have been a waste of money. Happily dropped 300 bucks at RPM instead. Read more The service was slow i guess that happens when you have 1 server outside. Our reservation wasn’t held and had to wait an additional  15 minutes.

Nice little hidden spot with a good menu. Great place to meet a friend for a nice lunch and glass of wine while shopping at Oak Brook.  Hidden gem inside Nordstrom. Food and service were excellent!  The remodeled, bright and spacious space is great and very clean!  It was an excellent choice for a lunch, even in an Saturday. We arrived 11:30 and it wasn’t crowded. They have a regular menu plus a special menu that changes every 2 months. Today was the last day of the current specials. I had ind if the best, freshest salads with fruit and nuts with a special dressing that was light and complemented the salad. My niece had the Avocado tacos that looked really good and she said were delicious.

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Pizza which was OK, but what they called Alfredo Sauce was tasteless and watery.  My companion ordered Salmon with polenta and cauliflower.

The service was fast , the food was hot, and delicious !  I took my mom here for lunch. We were surprised by the service and quality. It wasn’t what we expected for a restaurant inside the mall.

The service, food, atmosphere and value is exceptional.  Was disapppointed that a restaurant that seems to have an Italian name did not have cappucino on its menu.

Our server barely checked on us, forgot our drinks, and provided very little attention throughout the meal. This isn’t the first time—our previous visit was just as frustrating.

Good food. Great service. Our server, Colin, was very nice, very knowledgeable, put up with a lot of silliness from our table.  Everything was perfectly fine at Quartino. It was great food and the ambience in there is always enjoyable. Only complaint was our waitress. I really don’t want to knock on her too hard because she could’ve been very new to the restaurant with not a lot of experience, but it’s a little frustrating to ask questions about the menu and wines and not get any real answers. Drinking the wine out of water glasses when we asked for wine stems was a little odd too. We were told that’s what the wine was supposed to be served in, but there were two tables right next to us with real wine glasses so that was very confusing. We were on a date so it was a little bit of an odd experience with our seevice. Overall, great dinner though. We love Quartino and will keep coming back. Read more The seating was very cramped and uncomfortable, and the waitress was neither helpful nor attentive. My husband did enjoy the slider he sampled and my aunt and uncle enjoyed their eggplant Parmesan and salads, the rest of us were disappointed with our pizzas.

Read more Our server explained the food concept and timing of the dishes very clearly. We ordered appetizers, pizza, pasta, meat and dessert. Everything was prepared perfectly, well seasoned, and arrived at the right temperature. Generous portions for a ""sharable"" concept restaurant. Wine by the quart is a terrific deal! Read more Great experience as always! Will definitely be back  The food is good, no question about it and the staff are typically very nice. I honestly only go because my girlfriend loves the food. It's always chaos there and the impression is that quartino's is only focused on quality of food and making money. Our table this last visit was in a corner by the kitchen that barely fits a table. It was shoved into my stomach because my girlfriend was shoulder to shoulder with another table. If Quartino's goal is to give the impression that they want you to eat as fast as possible and get out. They've succeeded, because that's how my visit feels every time.

Had an awesome server very friendly and helpful  Our meal, service, the ambiance and friendly service were perfect.  Our waitress Gretchen was fantastic the food was great  The food and drinks are amazing, the service are fabulous.  Ordered food which took very long and when came pizza was made wrong. Expressed I wanted pizza the way I wanted it had them remake it which we ordered take out at that time. Pizza came which was good but waiter kept telling us take out order is delayed because kitchen backed up. This  happened at least two or three times. Finally called manager after 30 minutes of waiting for take out. He proceeded to get take out ready. We were there for over two hours. Manager compensated us with percentage off after I spoke of situation.

Good food, good service, a little pricey  Seated right away, great service, food came out quickly.  My biggest gripe is the me us were not wiped down- so not sanitized before being handed to us.  I know this because there was moist sauce inside the menu.  And the Table was sticky. Read more Service has really been getting worse . I would recommend carry out instead.   It was a really good weekend date. Burgers were amazing and the pizza was bombed. Definitely want to come back sometime soon. Service quality can be improve.  Took a friend here for the first time.

Did not like the change in my chicken parmigiana entre and that my favorite dessert funnel cake was removed from the menu.  My phone was broke, so I couldn't scan the wine menu, there wasn't one drink menu available, and they don't offer a corking fee for patrons to bring their own wine.  Food was good, unfortunately my guest had to keep seeking out the waitress, for the simplest thing such as water.  Great service and amazing food.  from the host to the food was great.. The only thing was my waiter very slow in looking out if we needed a refill ..napkind..clean plates. He came once on his own and other times I had to hunt him down. That not the first time with him. the cuople of times i visited and happen to get him whch is 4 times.

La sopa de cebolla no la pudimos tomar ya que estaba demasiado salada.
Al pedir un steak tartare, me dicen que no puedo elegir el grado de picante, ya que viene ya preparado de fuera…inaceptable para un plato que se debe preparar en el momento y al gusto del cliente…
El servicio, sin embargo, fue amable.

For the price, I think I could have a more enjoyable meal and modern experience elsewhere Read more We had a lovely evening at Venteux.

Don’t let the “French” title scare you. Delicious!!!!  The service was attentive and quick. My food was a totally different story. I ordered a shrimp cocktail and a salad. The shrimp came out mushy with a strong fishy taste. The cocktail sauce was too spicy to eat. I like spice and love hot cocktail sauce, but this was almost inedible without a bucket of milk.

Kitchen should know how to time dishes so that all are ready at the same time.  We like it very much, the personal was really kind with us  We really enjoy a Publican brunch and this morning was no exception. Thanks.  Just okay. Won’t ever be back as no need to make a special trip for average. Also, they tell you how you are going to eat their food and you just have to be okay with it.  Full disclosure - This is MY recent experience at the Publican and your experience may vary. I’ve had good experiences thus far, have been to Publican several times over the past few years - until this last visit. Can’t complain about food (always enjoy the meal) but the service was terrible. Drinks were not served until mid-meal, request for a dog bowl seemed to have escaped the servers mind - I had to remind another staff for both. I always bring out of town visitors to Publican for brunch but after this experience I won’t be coming to Publican again. Read more It was very empty for lunch, so felt a little strange. Other than that, 10/10. Great meal!  We have been here several times and today was by far rhe best. Every plate and drink were great, well served by Joe.  We far preferred dinner to lunch.  Some dishes were great, but sadly many were pretty basic. There was no ""dish to die for"" at lunch -- at dinner last month the Branzino was memorable.  Beverages almost all with alcohol -- how about some fresh orange juice?  Server often vanished for long periods. The place is well staffed for the volume of customers, but most of the servers seemed to be busy conversing (with each other, not their customers).  Noise level was way way way too high -- couldn't hear the others in our group.  Have noticed this before at Publican.  Perhaps  someone on staff who has hearing issues.   We will never be back for brunch, but will come back for dinner. Read more Service was exceptional, but the food felt a little over priced. Would be nice if they updated their menus on the website to match what they are serving  Always great service and food. Never had a bad meal or service at the Publican.   Octoberfest was really loud. Portion were really small for the price.  Love returning here when invite Chicago. Amazing food and service, never disappointing.  The Oktoberfest dinner was great!  And, as always, Blake was terrific. Thank you!  We went there for their Oktoberfest experience and it was great! The ambiance was warm and energetic. The music was perfect. The food was delicious! Highly recommend!  They had a great Oktoberfest menu and band playing outside. Service was great and the food was exceptional.  Love One OFF and am a devoted customer !!!

Missed the mark this time (it happens)

Won’t deter me from returning many times !!!! Read more Really disappointing. It is falling off. Very sad for me as I love this restaurant for so long.  Great Oktoberfest menu that vovered all the bases: sausage, schnitzel, beets, pretzels, the BEST potatoes.

We will definitely be coming back!  Food is always wonderful here! We had family in town & they were blown away by the publican signature bacon along with the other dishes we ordered.   It was good. Not great.  I had a Negroni. The rocks glass came out 2/3 full.  It was light. Was really looking forward to the roast chicken and fries. Chicken came out dry and the fries tasted like they were dropped in the frier a 3rd time to get hot…that doesn’t work guys. The fries get tough and gross.  Also had the sirloin. Ordered med rare. Came out med+.  Salad was nice. The oysters had really nice flavor albeit too much broken shell in the meat. The Broccolini was ok I guess. Not sure why it was brought out with the appetizer…. 15 min before the rest of the food. And then there was a bar area server who was clearly exhausted, at was 6:00 pm, he was yawning, rubbing his eyes and nose and then handling peoples drinks. Ya..I get it, he touched the outside of the glass, but it still think it’s odd. Anyway. I’d go back, but I wouldn’t hurry back.

They were very tasty along with a nice local (lime-flavored) beer.  Dinner was the porchetta that was spectacular as well.  I was just a party of one and sat at the bar.  Both bartenders were really nice and attentive without being overbearing.  Great place!  Great food!  Great service!  HIGHLY recommended!!! Read more Not what it used to be.  Salad, veg, and bread still great but the Ham Chop was not worth it and I've had it everything I've been there.  No longer a favorite.  Happy Hour on the patio is a great deal. Our waiter was terrific, the oysters and burger were great, but the schnitzel fell flat. It was overcooked and leathery. A real disappointment.  The chef’s tasting menu was excellent! Was worth the walk to the West Loop.  Superb meal at a great restaurant. We had the chef’s tasting menu and loved the variety and atmosphere. Highly recommend.  Inattentive service and vulgar songs during brunch wasn’t a great experience.  We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were treated like VIPs.

Value is poor, especially at lunch. The lobster cocktail was $38 and had about 2 ounces of lobster, if that. Very disappointing. The chopped Italian salad is very weak. At $18, such a miniature portion at $18 is just not a good value, especially when many people like a salad for lunch). The salad was predominantly marinated red bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and a few slivers of salami.

With a wide-ranging menu of dishes, you’ll feel right at home at our table.","Wonderful dinner and service. Dealt with an obnoxiously loud group of 12 for the first half of dinner, but that’s not the restaurant’s fault. The vibe by the end of our visit was probably a much better indicator of a typical night at Saba. We’ll definitely be back. Read more I came here to celebrate my marriage! My wife and I both got the 3 course dinners and it was great! Our starters and main course was phenomenal, I was pleasantly surprised at the portions. The gelato unfortunate had a strange texture for the both of us. My chocolate gelato was icy in the middle and my wife’s pistachio gelato genuinely tasted like play dough. A fight also broke out during our dinner but that was behinds the staff control and they were. try apologetic. We were also given housemate orangecello at the end of our evening and it was absolutely phenomenal. Everything was served piping hot and was absolutely delectable. Read more My family loves the food at Saba and the service is always excellent, which is why we go there for dinner for birthdays.  We will always go back to Saba.  It was a little too loud, but the food and dessert was amazing!  Absolutely fabulous all around. Food, ambiance, and Diego, our waiter! And half-price wine bottles that night was an extra plus! Highly recommended!  Wonderful staff all around! Portions are large. We shared 3 entrees, 1 salad and an appetizer among 5 people. The short rib dish was excellent!  Celebrated my 50th Birthday and they did not disappoint. Lovely time. Great food great drinks amazing service. equals fantastic memories. Most definitely will recommend!  From check in to leaving the restaurant, the staff was very friendly.  Kaitlyn was our server and she was great.  Very attentive and friendly.  It was a little hot in the space. But loved the food, the service was better than any we have received in YEARS. And the food was so tasty, the flavors exploding in the mouth and not overwhelming. Cannot recommend enough. Possibly sit outside during the warmer seasons to get the breeze Read more We ate outside on the patio.

Everything was amazing, thank you all so much for all that you do.  Our servers were very kind and attentive. They all wished us a happy anniversary throughout our visit. They gave us two drinks, on the house, as a gift. The vibe of the restaurant was relaxing and perfect for our dinner. Read more I am such a fan of Saba Kitchen that I wanted to share it as part of a thank you dinner for a friend.

A lovely place for a date with the gals or a cute date night.  Made a reservation for 14 people, had no issues being seated. Food came quickly and everything was delicious.

The dessert was really delicious as well as the food, second time there and amazing experience.  The food was absolutely delicious!

Tara spoke very highly about the daily specials and she was not wrong! Will definitely be going there again. Read more The patio could be a nicer and more private experience. Our host almost didn’t seat us on the patio because it was 9 pm but then allowed it since it was made through Open Table. Our waitress and the rest of the staff was very nice and patient with us. Due to the location of the restaurant, I wouldn’t recommend sitting late outside but the inside looks nice. We just had the fries which were enough to share for 4. The cheesecake was good but the crust was soft. The limoncello flight was fun. The white sangria was not as refreshing as expected.

Great food, HORRIBLE service. Ate breakfast there today and had a reservation. We were seated right by the front near the kitchen, and somehow we were never seen by a waitress. 15 minutes go by with out being tended to and I finally walk over to the hostess and ask if we could have a waitress over to take our order. The hostess comes over and takes our order instead of a waitress. Our food comes out, 2 of 3 orders are wrong. I send mine back to be corrected but my husband decides it’s not worth it since he is really hungry. We eat our food and by the end we have not gotten offered a coffee or water refill a single time and the only person helping us is the hostess(but only when we walk up there to ask for something). By the end we are so confused, the only thing they did promptly do was bring us our check when we were done eating. No apologies or explanation for the lack of service. It was such an uncomfortable experience. Read more Food and service were excellent. We had the burger, truffle fries and tomato salad. Burger was large, seared and well seasoned.

Great place with great service and drinks. Food was pretty good but the lasagna wasn’t liked by all. Other dishes were great!  Our server was hilarious and amazing and the food was fantastic  Server suggestions were spot-on — wonderful food!  Not typical hotel restaurant!  Would definitely go back.  The carrots on the appetizer menu were phenomenal!  Amazing! The food was beyond words. Service was spectacular. Who I assume was the restaurant manager was super helpful and took the time to check in on each table. I had pointed out some weird social media issue where it was showing the restaurant as closed for dinner service but we were still able to make reservations on Open Table.

Great experience. I had dinner with a friend from long ago and the staff was so kind as we sat for a while. Food was delicious!  Very walkable from the Riverwalk. Nice vibe inside. Felt modern but still welcoming, cozy. We had a fantastic server, Jordan. He was attentive and kind. We were very happy with the service and the delicious food. Fresh pasta and sauces were amazing. My husband is a dessert junkie and he FELL IN LOVE with the skillet cookie. Sooo good. Skillet cookies are hard because they usually end up over cooking the edges but this cookie was perfectly warm and gooey throughout!

The service was excellent both at the bar and restaurant  The staff was very nice and service was good. The outdoor seating by the water was nice. The food was meh. Our fries were delivered cold but they replaced them right away. The short rib quesadillas were tasty but the margarita pizza was just ok. Read more I had made a reservation for what I thought was Water's Edge, but it turns out it was the Hyatt Lodge restaurant.  Apparently, they share the same space, but Water's Edge only serves lunch.  That was a bit confusing, especially since no employee was there to greet and seat us.  So be aware of that. There were only two waiters, which was fine since it was not very crowded, but it took a few minutes before either of them acknowledged our presence. After that all went well.  The food was delicious, waiter service was fine, and dining on the outside patio by the small lake was quite nice on a perfect weather day.

Food as great
Patio is beautiful!  Great experience!!!!! You should go to experience it all :)  We hosted a very large table after or wedding the night before at The Lodge. They did such a great job!  There is no Water's Edge by which you can have dinner. Only some meals are served at certain times. And dinner is not one of them. You instead are directed to eat in the bar, whuch has a different name, and which has a limited menu selection.  So I'm not sure why they allow you to make reservations and then send you elsewhere. Read more We had a very large group, and the servers handled every request with graciousness and efficiency!!  Spent 250.00 prepaid for two people for mothers day brunch. Food was sub par. The mimosas were made with 4.00 wycliff “champagne” we were promised live music, the entertainment was on stage a total of 5 minutes before taking a break for the remainder of our brunch: brunch was NOT at the restaurant they advertised: it was hosted in a banquet room that was nearly empty with table numbers like we were at a diner.  For 250.00 we expected a LOT more for our money. Would never recommend going here for a event like this again. Read more This brunch is overpriced compared to similar holiday/celebration brunches in regards to food offerings and ambiance.
It was good, and the service team was very pleasant, but it was not worth $50 more per person than almost all the other brunches in the area.
Now I understand why there was more availability here than anywhere else. This would be a more popular choice if overall $$$$ was reduced. Read more Read more We went to Waters Edge for Mothers Day Brunch with a party of 10.  The food selection was poor.  I expected much better for $120 per person.  I thought this was an actual restaurant, especially since it was on Open  Table. I  made a reservation for 5. While the setting is lovely, we were basically the only people in the place.

Imagine my surprise to discover that it is one small step up from a fast food restaurant. You order at the counter from a very limited menu.  The food is brought out to you, which is what makes it one step up from fast food. It’s the only “restaurant” in the hotel.

I would think a beautiful venue like the Hyatt could do better. Read more Nice experience. The server was great. He made my friend feel special with a slice of cake for her birthday. It was a nice quiet lunch. Nice atmosphere.  This restaurant is located in the Hyatt Lodge, which has either valet parking or you have to park in a separate lot across from the hotel.  If you have mobility issues, this could be a consideration.  We picked this restaurant because it started with the letter “W”.  Long story.  We made reservations for breakfast on Open Table.  When we got there, the staff had absolutely no idea what to do with our reservations.  We thought it was a sit-down restaurant.     You order breakfast from the service counter, you pick a table, and they bring the food out to you.  We thought it was pricey- $60 for breakfast!  Fortunately, it wasn’t crowded and we got seats right by a view of the pond.  We had an omelet, French toast, a muffin, and two coffees.  The food was good but nothing spectacular.  The blueberry muffin was excellent though!  Based on our experience, the best thing about this restaurant is the lovely setting.  It must be even prettier when the flowers have bloomed and the trees have leafed out.  Everything else was just okay:  ambience, service, food.   Would we return?  Possibly, if we were ever back in the area. Read more Best Easter brunch in Western suburbs.  Not crowded and good champagne.  We had a very large party for Easter brunch.

Now it is just a kind of fancy continental breakfast. I've done a bunch of their Easter Brunches before, but this one was our last.

Not quite as elaborate as in the past but still very good.  The setting and the service were. excellent.  It was my daughter's 5th birthday and the gentlemen accommodated our large group.

It was fantastic!  Went for the Prancer's PopUp. Expected it to be decorated to the max. It wasn't.  Took 5 minutes to just get water. Server never came to take our drink order, after 10 minutes. They weren't that busy. Food menu was not impressive.  The bartender came by and told our server would be with us shortly.  Still another 5 minutes went by. 
We left! Read more I made a reservation however when we arrived the restaurant itself was dark and we were redirected to the bar area to order. The person at the bar said he didn’t know about reservations. We sat ourselves at the only vacant table and waited. Finally we saw another guy who apologize they were crowded and only had two people working and said he would be with use as soon as he could. I even went to the hotels desk to ask questions and was told they were a separate entity. This was not what we expected after making a reservation. Read more Don’t make people make reservations when there’s no one there to even check you in. Making reservation does nothing. You still have to stand in line behind people ordering at the checkout. It makes no sense. And also you should give some information about where to park because it’s super confusing. Read more Lovely place to eat. Very cozy. Food was good as were drinks.  Cute decorations. Food was ok and drinks were ok. Still a hotel bar.  Water's Edge was okay since it was the only place to eat in the hotel at that time. Food was good, prices are high. Using Open Table didn't help. We made a reservation for 12 and the table was not ready when we arrived. Staff didn't seem to know anything about it. Read more The restaurant was solid. Nothing revolutionary, but nothing awful either. We had artichoke dip, chicken fingers, and the burger -- all were very good. Dinner is served in the bar area not the Waters Edge restaurant.

The service was great except that we were sitting outside and as the evening progressed, the temp was dropping.  There are propane heaters in plain view and when we asked if they could light one up for us so we could continue to stay outside, we were told they are only used for events.  It just seems strange that during the pandemic many restaurants were using them, why wouldn’t they light just one up for our table?  The food was also very good and arrived quickly.

Everything else, not so good. I appreciate a leisurely brunch but service was so spotty we were never quite sure who our server was and if our orders were even being put in.  The food was mediocre and clearly had been sitting waiting to be served so it was cold.  As much as I enjoyed the music, I paid for the food and service and that wasn’t great. Read more Fantastic brunch. The live jazz was unexpected but a wonderful added touch.  Read more Food was wonderful though service was slow. Waiter was kind and gracious but my guess was either the waitstaff or kitchen staff may have been understaffed that day. Also, this was the evening of the worldwide  tech failure and could have been the core issue with delayed food deliveries/prep time.  Really good food, lovely to sit outside on a summer night.  Recommend. Read more We ordered a glass of juice and they gave us an alcoholic beverage. When we let them know about it, they charged us for the juice we never received instead.  Everyone was so nice, and went above and beyond. Euro was on and our waiter spent 10 minutes logging in so that we could watch the match, and the host greeted us so nicely because we were celebrating Jen’s black belt Read more Great menu and service! Original items hard to find elsewhere plus great mix of cocktails.  The GM was amazing, she made sure we had a chance to stay dry on the patio. When the weather went South, she set us up inside very quickly. 
She even noted it was my birthday and brought out a comped order of pancakes with a candle at the end of the meal.
Really liked the mediterranean menu, lovely brunch dishes. Nice big mugs of coffee, this is a great place. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/66494921.webp

Outstanding. The only item is that it was quite loud inside; however, we were seated in the very back room behind the inside bar. This was amazing because we were clear of 95% of the craziness I tend to dislike when out at a restaurant.

Highlights were the garlic potato salad, stuffed mushrooms, and again- the paella was everything!!!! Good sangrias and wine selection. I will definitely be back!

I also found it problematic that they allow seating by people wearing gym clothes in a restaurant of that caliber.  We were here for breakfast. Overall, the quality of the food and the server’s attitude were very good, but I expected a much better ambiance.  Read more Nice Sunday brunch.  Decor was impressive and all the staff were so nice  Ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  All meals were delicious and service was superb.  Highly recommend.

He was attentive but not overbearing, knowledgeable, and accommodating. We both wanted French Onion Soup but felt it was too hearty to have with an entree. He said we could split it. It came in two small crocks. Adorable. The soup was the best I've had outside of France. He also recommended their sidecar, which they call Dusable, named after the founder of Chicago. Excellent! My friend loved the Reisling he recommended. The shrimp risotto I had was good, but not great. My friend had the burger and said it was wonderful. I ordered one to go for the next day!

Read more We're in Chicago visiting family around the time of our anniversary and so we walked over to Brass Tack for a quiet meal with just the two of us. This happened to be when the cloud flare cyber security issue is going on and all the credit card systems were down. Upon arrival we were told we would need to pay cash for the visit which was unexpected. Not their fault but I didn't have a couple hundred dollars on me in cash at the time.  They did offer an ATM machine in the building and so we did that and enjoyed our meal.

Service was excellent, really tough class. Drinks were on par from the bar we tried two of the different signature drinks which were really good.  Appetizer we had with calamari that was delicious. Main dishes of steaks and seafood we're on par cook perfectly and very good.  I felt the service really went above and beyond to help us celebrate our anniversary.

Great fun food
Can’t wait to go back!  Trash , don’t waste ur time unless it’s like 1 min walk but still trash  Ambience and food were great, a little pricey for what you get but definitely generous portions.  Not very breakfast-y, which was disappointing. The food was fine  - although the portions were too big - but more Asian-influenced than I anticipated, and lacked usual breakfast items. I also disliked the ordering system using a QR code at the table or at the counter and forcing you to tip in advance. It was like ordering at an airport restaurant. Won’t return. Read more I had the Zen Bowl, and it was very filling and delicious! I was able to take half home, so I can't wait to enjoy the leftovers later.  From our Facebook post. First timers….mot impressed. Presentation is very nice. Burger was very flavorful. The rest was pretty basic and taco steak was tough and chewy. Half of 1 of 3 tacos all sitting wasted on my discard plate.  1-5 stars, Two ⭐️ The rice and beans on taco plate ice cold. Tater tots, luke warm. Their preparation and timing is off. Also, gratuity is the first screen you see at payment (before), any service or meal delivered. No issue with gratuity as we overtip. However, after signing for gratuity, may as well call it self service. Had to get up and ask for everything. Water, refills, boxes, hot sauce.  Didn’t even ask for refills or bags cause we got tired of asking for shh. Won’t be back as it’s more of an instagram portable than actual service and food. Read more Experience was good. Food was so so. Hated the ordering system. Took too long then when an error happened on our order we had to wait quite a while for them to fixing since we had to prepay on app Read more The food wasn’t good. My French toast were burnt. Service was okay. You basically order on your phone and they bring it out to you.  Great place to dine. Parking was difficult if looking for street parking and they had no available lot.

Great food and menu items, service was quick with water and food once ordered, cocktails came quickly too, however they were out of several basic items that impeded our food and cocktail order. Overall great place to go with friends for a brunch Read more It was  cute place but a little weird that you had to order food through a QR code (which was fine) but add a tip in advance! I had ordered a Big John and am not sure whether a bowl mainly filled with tator tots, some bacon and eggs on top was worth $14. Bloody mary was good! The wait staff was very friendly and service was prompt. It was also a cute brunch place! Read more It was fabulous!  Delicious!  Great service! I would definitely go back!  Food was okay. It looked pretty, and photo worthy. Service wasn’t great. They make you order food and pay for the food online by scanning the QR code on the table and they bring it to you in the restaurant, even though they have servers. My friend and I ordered food at the same time, but her food came about 10-12 minutes later, which I thought was a little strange. We never had the same person twice. Unfortunately we had to ask for a water refill multiple times, and also ask how to get to go containers. The space is an odd shape so tables are very close together so it didn’t feel private at all as multiple people accidentally bumped into us at the table while trying to get through the tight area. Also really strange as they have a toilet room, but there is no sink at all. We thought it was quite gross to have a bathroom with no running water and no other area to wash hands. We absolutely could have missed something but there were no signs showing where the running water was. Read more Friendly staff and chill vibes. Great place for customers!  Overall the food was low quality and while the ordering and paying on a QR code vs through a server is convenient - it was not ideal if you have question about the menu as a first time guest.

Will certainly tell me friends about it and go back. Burrito was great  The food was delicious and the restaurant was beautiful!! I love the ability to call your server over and order on your phone.  The food was actually super good and the staff is super nice. The set up is BEAUTIFUL! We were sat pretty quickly despite arriving two hours prior to our reservation.  Loved the location and the decor. Food was average. Staff was great.  Minimal service. You have to order, pay, and tip from your phone before you even receive your food. The food was pretty, but not very tasty in my opinion, but the coffee was great. This is place is more for the photo op you can get rather than the actual dining experience. Read more Love the play on words and the decor was fresh and colorful. It was unique and the food was good.  Very cool space. Nice that we could make brunch reservations. The food was delicious, but the noise level was such that the people went to the counter to order for the table were misheard and we did not get exactly the food we had wanted. Purely our fault. Nevertheless, everything we got tasted great. Read more This restaurant is very misleading. Everything about their marketing implies heavily that they serve food & drink that can get you high.

The food was great, and the experience was great. As far as steakhouses go, this was exceptional, but the price did not match up to the overall experience that we probably expected. We are glad that we came to the Michael Jordan steakhouse, but this will probably be our only visit when we travel to Chicago. We do not have any “complaints”, but it just didn’t quite match the price tag. Read more The Michael Jordan Steakhouse in Chicago offers a refined atmosphere, but my dining experience fell short. While the mac & cheese was delightful, the steak was overcooked, lacking both thickness and flavor, and the mushrooms had an unexpected taste reminiscent of fast-food teriyaki. The automatic gratuity was unwelcome, especially given the limited service staff, as there appeared to be only one waiter. Overall, it didn’t quite meet my expectations for a high-end steakhouse. Three out of five stars. Read more Read more Horrible experience. Waitress was not concerned when displeasure was expressed over food. Steak was average at best. Sides were over cooked or cold. You could get a better steak at billy goat tavern down the street. Do not go here if you want a high quality meal. 0/10. Read more I don’t write this review lightly, as I understand there are always two sides to a story. However, I feel it’s important to share my experience. Recently, my friend and I went to a steakhouse and ordered a medium steak. Everything started off well, and we enjoyed the appetizers. But when the steak arrived, we realized after a few bites that it was more cooked than we had requested. We tried to get our waiter’s attention, but he was nowhere to be found for quite some time. In the meantime, we attempted to flag down other staff members, but one of them gave us a look of disgust, almost as if it was inappropriate to ask for help. After waiting 15-20 minutes without any sign of our waiter, I finally went downstairs to speak to the manager. When the manager came up, instead of being understanding, he seemed irritated and started lecturing us about the difference between medium and medium rare, as though we didn’t know the difference. I couldn’t help but wonder if this treatment had anything to do with the fact that we were two young Asian women dining at an upscale steakhouse. He raised his voice, which drew the attention of the other guests, leaving us embarrassed and uncomfortable. Rather than offering a solution, he essentially dismissed our concern, implying we didn’t know how steak should be cooked. At that point, we simply asked if they could reheat the steak since 20 minutes had passed and it had gone cold. The manager was visibly annoyed by this too, but after more back-and-forth, he begrudgingly agreed to cook a new steak for us, though he warned it would take a while. Overall, the experience left me feeling humiliated and upset. I don’t want to jump to conclusions about the manager’s motives, but the way we were treated was both embarrassing and disheartening. Read more Awesome food, I had the filet mignon and 4 cheese mac and cheese. The steak was moist and tender with a buttery taste  Julio was amazing. My son and I had a great experience at Jordan's. He treated us like family.  This is my 3rd visit and everything has been consistent. The food is always top notch.  Service was good , jumpman cocktail was great everything else was extremely overpriced and not worth the visit.  Went for a birthday and David was nothing other than perfect !  Great food.

Read more The food at the Allis is generally good quality and has nice flavors. We did their afternoon tea service. Compared to some in the city, the price is okay, however, the selection of teas is quite limited and only Rishi teas (available easily off the shelf) are offered. They used to offer tea from Rare Tea Cellar I believe. That would have been much better. The quantity of food was quite limited. That was disappointing for the price. I would have liked to eat to fullness considering the cost. Most of the items were fine tasting sweets, but not particularly special.

We had a birthday and were given a complimentary piece of cake  One of the worst meals we’ve ever had. And we brought an out of town guest. It was embarrassing and a shocking waste of $175. The swordfish kabobs were so dry we all only choked down one tiny shriveled piece. It took 40 minutes to even receive our first dish which was a chintzy burrata dish with grossly sweet tomato jam. The cauliflower au gratin was something out of a horror movie. It was also the only truly edible thing on our table. Our server was very kind and I could see he was the only person working the entire floor and I felt bad for him. But they kept seating tables even though they were understaffed and that’s a choice. I should have just made another reservation somewhere else when they called me at 7pm, thirty minutes before our reservation, saying they wanted to close early at 8 and do we still want to come in….When we arrived they were accepting walk ins which was very confusing. I don’t understand how this place has so many good reviews. The food was atrocious and overpriced. Read more Great food,  prices, and service.

The gelato and sorbet was excelent. The chicken was a little lemoney. The onion soup was good. The lobster roll was a little over done. Waiter was nice.  I made this reservation for dinner before attending a Broadway in Chicago play and chose Bandol for its close proximity to the theater.

At the time we arrived at Bandol, it was too late to make a reservation at another restaurant near the theater.

Would try again Read more Saturday menu was limited so didn’t have the selections we wanted but we understood  My partner and I spent date night here this past Saturday night. We shared three appetizers, oysters, crab cakes and the French onion soup. Oysters will forever be my favorite but those crab cakes are a close second! So much crab meat!!! For our main course I had the seared scallops and he had the salmon. The scallops are always cooked perfectly but that salmon skin was the crispiest most delicious I’ve ever had. My partner also had the patatas bravas with his salmon and those we also exceptional! After dinner we headed upstairs to Aire for drinks and dessert and were not disappointed! We had the flourless chocolate cake and highly recommend it! Will be back for sure!!! Read more I went with my niece for happy hour.

The bathroom is a bit far and they were out of some desserts, but a great dinner spot overall.  Read more Good was great but took nearly an hour to come.

We went for dinner just prior to a Broadway in Chicago show down the street on a Saturday night, and the place was almost empty.  There was a guy moping up the floor, and we weren't even sure it was open.  But we sat down, and saw the staff all wearing ugly T-Shirts promoting a roof top bar that had nothing to do with the restaurant.  The kitchen really messed up an order, saying that they made a chicken dish atop the salmon we ordered....bizarre!  The atmosphere was fine, the food was actually good, but if this restaurant is going to survive it can't be empty on a Saturday night! Read more We tried Bandol for brunch this morning and walked out after a 30 minute wait for a sweet starter that never arrived. We never saw our mains, either, or even a hint that our meal was on its way.

We were greeted and seated promptly, with coffees brought out in a timely manner. Things fell apart after that, likely a kitchen issue as others seemed to be waiting for food too. After bringing our coffees, our server never checked in with us again and only noticed us as we gave her cash for the coffees. Very disappointing… Read more The food was not good, overcooked eggs and unappetizing soggy bacon. I would not recommend or go back. The service was fine.  Really terrible, they never served us. There are so many options in Chicago, try something else.  Cute quiet place for a yummy breakfast/brunch. The cinnamon roll and crab cakes were amazing.  Went with group for special birthday.  Despite making reservations weeks in advance and calling restaurant twice to make sure we had good table — service simply sucked. Waited 30mins for drink order despite restaurant occupied by only 2 other tables.  We simply left.  Never going back. Read more Went there for a brunch on a Sunday. It was connected to the hotel I was staying at. My daughter and son-in-law who live in Chicago were with me.
They were not full at 11:15 and we were seated promptly. We were then ignored for about 15 minutes.
We tried to order lattes, but the barista wasn’t there, so only brewed coffee. We ordered a lavender-cream waffle off of the starter menu as a starter. We had to ask about it after our food came out later.
Someone asked for ketchup for fries, and they were out. They had called for “some other location to bring them some.”
The food was okay and the server was pleasant, but I wouldn’t recommend or go back. Read more Kind of average food. Steak frites was pretty charred for medium. The presentation on the plate was best described as sloppy. Service was painfully slow despite the restaurant being only half full.

This place is cute love the vibe but everything was just meh... 

We went to support our friend who was DJ'ing that Saturday for brunch. He was awesome but I wouldn't go here if it wasn't for him. 

the food was just ok.. very heavy on the beef, and pork which is a no-go for me. We both had the chicken sandwich and didn't even finish it. It wasn't good at all. the drinks we had were so spicy we couldn't even enjoy them then come to find out instead of jalapeno peppers muddled (which I asked for) they gave us poblano peppers. And wasn't gonna say anything until I asked. Didnt comp the drink or even apologize for the mistake. 

It's gonna be a NO for me. But bring back the DJ and I'll eat before hand. Read more This was by far one of the best brunches I’ve experienced in Chicago!

Apologized, cleaned up table. Floor needed to be wiped up. We asked 3 times and never happened. Waited for our check, never saw either of our servers again. We were all standing near our table. Rest of group went outside and I went to front to find someone so could pay bill. Was told by hostess any server could get us our bill. Found another server who pulled our bill. Definitely understaffed. We were all very disappointed.

Not to mention, the fried catfish is the best I have had in my entire life—and I am a catfish aficionado and complete snob. It is very easy to screw up catfish, and extremely difficult to make it very well—and CheSa does it better than anyone!

In addition, every single meal we've had at CheSa's has been both a culinary delight and a wonderful dining experience. The service is excellent and the whole venue is light and airy and super clean.

I am fortunate to live just down the street from here, which means I can eat at CheSa's whenever I like. Lucky me! Read more Wonderful food, great selection, will go back and recommend  Excellent service and various amount of options to choose from. Food was amazing and I will definitely be going back!  CheSa's Bistro was AMAZING! We were celebrating my adult daughter's 41st birthday, and Brianna and CheSa both made us feel like we were having brunch with loving family members! They checked on us often and the food was DELICIOUS! As a new pescatarian, I find it hard to find really good fish meals, but CheSa's catfish skillet was EVERYTHING.

I ordered the jimbalaya crawfish and my partner ordered the gumbo. We were both delighted with the complexity of the dishes which was layered with subtled flavors. The ambience was low key and the asthetics were very well thoughout. Read more The fried chicken and beignet waffles were amazing. The waffles were even better than the beignets I had in New Orleans before becoming gluten free. The crawfish tortellini was also delicious.  Everything was delicious!!! I had the collard green oysters and the fried catfish fillets with smothered potatoes and eggs. I’ll be back for sure!  Hidden Gem that I highly recommend for anyone looking for homemade, good authentic creole soul food, with love. Chef CheSa is an amazing cook, extremely personable, and loves what she does.  Do yourself a favor and visit and indulge in an enjoyable, flavorful, filling experience, where you will leave both full and satisfied! Read more I made a reservation on Open Table and drove all the way to the restaurant just for them to be closed. The hours on the door was the same as on here. They charged my card for the reservation and I’m currently waiting for the hold to be released. Very unprofessional and careless in my opinion.

Highly recommended.  Generally good and a good value. Brunch buffet is an exceptional value when you consider the omelette bar.  It was our first time here and eating Turkish food. The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive. Highly recommen it.  Delicious weekend buffet brunch of Turkish foods plus custom omelette/waffle/pancakes. Full restaurant is a bit loud; buffet comprised of all savory items with the exception of spreads to put on items, which is strange given that they have a bakery + restaurant. Read more Service was excellent.  The fresh squeezed lemonade was terrific after a long hot day!  Food was great, esp the lamb.  Enjoy!  The service was very good.  We were greeted immediately.  They offered us Turkish tea which we had not had before.  They offered to let us try it and it was delicious.

We have had Mediterranean food before but not Turkish.  They gave us good explanations of our options and good descriptions of some of the foods that we had not heard of before.  We ended up ordering the Sunrise Feast which serves 4-5 people.  It was a delightful experience of so many different foods.  From french fries and waffles with fresh sweet fruits to tahin pekmez, honey kaymek, 5 different cheeses, cucumbers, olives and it goes on.  Most items are served on individual plates so there were about 15-20 plates brought to the table.   There were 4 of us with different tastes and everyone went away happy and full.

We had to take a loaf of the bread home that they served in the restaurant as it was so good by itself or with the tahin pekmez, honey kaymek or the nutella.

Of course we had to wander through the bakery to take home a dessert or two because we certainly did not have room for it with the meal.

And all of this for under $20 per person!  Unbelievable and so good!

Read more The only negative I have is that every table is charged a mandatory 18% service fee. Just call it a mandatory rip because this is exactly what it is. Then the receipt has space for more tip?

This is unacceptable. Read more Went during their special buffet meal. Had reservations at 1:15pm, we were seated immediately, but the line to get food from the buffet was at least 15-20 minutes long.   When we dod get food, most of the meat dishes were warm at best with some being cold.   Their special buffet seating may have outgrown their capacity for service.  Previously had not had any complaints before, but this day's experience was bad.  For $50pp I expected better quality food.   It didn't help that some of their patrons in the buffet line were very rude, but that is not the restaurant's fault.  It just made this dining experience worse. Read more I came for a brunch buffet. The price was $35/person. Whats offered was a breakfast at best:
- There were no juices
- No shrimp offered for omlet
- Most of the offering were items from their bakery. Did not have any Lahmajoun.
- No meats or chicken ( only processed meat like sujuk).
Overall not a good value for the money. On top of that you are charged 18% for service although the kevel of service is fair at best.

We will definitely be returning to the Fillmore. Read more They didn't seem to have enough staff/waiters, so service was slow. The waiters they had were so busy, they forgot part of my order. They did bring it when I asked the second time and actually brought a bowl instead of a cup of soup I had ordered. However, the soup had a piece of hair that was clearly not mine in it, so can't say that they really redeemed themseleves. At the end, the waiter had given himself an automatic 20% gratuity (nowhere on the menu did it say they will automatically apply gratuity, so not sure if this is standard practice), which I paid even though I was not happy with the service. Also, there was an automatic ""voluntary"" additional service charge of about $4 added to the bill for the staff.  On the bill it did say guests can ask to remove the service charge, but it wasn't really voluntary as it was already included and not an election you can make. Overall, the atmosphere is ok, but the service and food are subpar at best. Wouldn't go back to this restaurant. Read more Service was extremely slow. It took several minutes to be greeted by a host at the front door. After being seated, we waited several minutes for our server. After ordering, we waited more than 30 minutes for our omelets (very simple orders).
The food was decent (omelets, potatoes, fruit) and it wasn’t overpriced. So thumbs up for being reasonable. Read more Service was great, even as they got busier throughout our time there. The food all came out quickly and was very tasty overall. Our server was attentive and quick to action. 

The chicken sausage breakfast sandwich was a nice switch from bacon or something. It tasted great and the bun was very nice too. The breakfast potatoes could perhaps be a bit crispier, but they tasted great so it wasn't a big deal. My wife and mother-in-law liked their breakfasts, too. 

We got there around 8:15 am on a Saturday and it wasn't busy yet, but by 8:45am, it was almost full I think.

I would go again.  Gave us a private area which was great. Our server Abby was off the charts excellent. Friendly, patient and so easy with every request. It made the whole experience great.  Eggs Benedict was not runny even tho I asked for it specifically to be. And it came on 1 slice of bacon (not ham or Canadian bacon) on an english muffin not really toasted. My friend had an omelette which she asked to not be cooked too much but came out looking almost burnt.

It took 40 minutes to receive a single appetizer, and an hour to receive lunch entrees.  The server was inattentive and only acknowledged the wait after our table asked another server about it.

My first time here and the ambience was the stand out with service a close second.  A pretty buzzy place with what looked to be a completely full house.

The food was unfortunately mixed.  We did the Experience flight and the patatas bravas were flat as were the brussels sprouts and desert / churros.  We did appreciate the accommodation of fitting octopus into the flight, and it was very good.  The other items were good, but not remarkable.

I’d probably give the flight another shot hoping this experience was a misfire.  I’d definitely go back for drinks. Read more Menu is tedious to read ... should simplify.

We ended up trying about 10 tapas, but unfortunately, only 1-2 of them tasted good. Temperature and consistency were fine, but the flavor was not it, especially with the mussels.

The servers are so nice but they appear understaffed a lot. So service can be a little slow. Still one of my favorite places though.  Another wonderful experience at this fabulous restaurant. I cannot say enough about the warm service, the excellent food, the ambience that is so warm and inviting.  We were made to feel as if we were the most important customers! All the managers, and especially Joey who has only been there for a few weeks, had such warm and inviting personalities.
Not only did they create a special experience for us, but Joey had a special delicious drink created for my sister who does not drink alcohol.
Jose was our waiter and he was so attentive, customer service oriented, friendly, and always at the table checking on us.

Be back!  Some really good hits; some misses, sometimes in the same dish. The stems of the grilled asparagus were hard and woody; they shoud have been cut off; but the tips were delicious as was the sauce. Tabla con Queso was excellent as were the Pan con Tomate. Croquetas de Seta were boring, and you could not taste the truffle oil. Coca de Setas (grilled flatbread) was good. The orange olive-oil cake was good and the churros were excellent. The music was so loud that we had trouble talking. Read more Good food but it was so loud that it was difficult to talk with the other people at my table.  I made a standard reservation which I assumed was dining room and they tried to sit us outside on a chilly night.  My friend cannot tolerate cold and it was frustrating that they tried to sit us outside. Usually when you make the reservation you can choose patio if you want. Standard should mean dining room.  The hostess tried to tell me that the system decides. Was not happy about this and then had to wait until a table inside was available. Read more The whole experience was absolutely incredible!
Everyone from our server to the manager were  so attentive, energetic and friendly the food and drinks were delicious. Perfect visit all together. Read more Average food quality. The Tortilla Espanola is good. We had a selection of 7 other tapas which were average.  Excellent place : you feel like in Spain !

The name ""Whiskey Hill"" pays homage to a speakeasy run by the Reitmayer family during Prohibition. Known for brewing exceptional beer and distilling whiskey, this establishment became a hub for locals and visitors alike. Today, Whiskey Hill continues this tradition of creativity and community spirit.

Join us to savor our craft beverages and create your own memorable experiences at Whiskey Hill Brewing Company in Westmont, Illinois!","Read more We didn’t get our requested table when we made a reservation and service was slow  The Whiskey Hill is finally here! As neighbors, we are very excited to see this establishment up and running. Our server, Jenna, did an outstanding job. She guided us through food & drink options, was attentive, and extremely personable. It was apparent that she took pride in her job and was invested in the success of the restaurant. There are many seating options: outdoor, high tops, tables, and even a private room. Great for couples, friends, and families. The atmosphere is vibrant with chic decor, TVs for sports and such, and a very friendly staff that worked as a team. We had the burger and pulled pork sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious! We recommend the pickle chips and uniquely cut fries. The beer (try Oktoberfest!) and cocktails were equally delicious. Chris, the GM, graciously checked in with us. We ended our evening with a decadent dessert which was brought in from the Bacuri Bakery across the street. We loved the neighborhood partnership and were compelled to try the empanadas from the bakery the next day! We didn't rate the restaurant with a full 5 stars only because there's always room for improvement, especially when first starting out. However, it was evident that the entire team at Whiskey Hill is dedicated to creating a high end and inviting neighborhood 'go to' spot.  Hopefully, the people of Westmont and especially the Village, do everything on their end to support this anchor restaurant so that the revitalization of our downtown can continue. Cheers to Whiskey Hill! Read more First time at Whiskey Hill.... food was delicious, and the service was great.  We will definitely be back!!!  It was our first time there and will not be our last. We went around 6PM on a Saturday, crowd was light when we arrived but there was a steady flow of patrons as it got later. We were able to sit outside on the patio and it was great evening for outside dinning. My wife had the Baton Rouge Chicken Sammy, she said the bacon and ghost pepper cheese knocked it out of the park for her. I had the pulled pork sandwich, very flavorful with the right amount of smoke. We both had the fries which were awesome.  We were able to get tasters of several beers before deciding which one to have with our meal. It was a great time and we will definitely go back. Read more Ordered drinks and apps.  Apps came in 20 min.  Still didn’t have our drinks.  No plates.  I could give a pass for being understaffed but food was below average and the beer was mediocre.  Many better options. Read more Love the ambiance and outdoor seating. INside it was way too loud to even have a conversation, but enough room outside to sit. I was left feeling underwhelmed by the food. I took my husband for his birthday and ordered the Nachos (which were really loaded fries) and margherita pizza (which was really a flatbread or crispy pita chip). The ""Nachos"" were really good, the fries were crispy on the outside and ""pillowy"" on the insider. The cheese blend was delicious. The brisket on top was very fatty, but flavourful. 

The pizza was more like a flatbread or crispy pita chip. With sliced tomatoes and some melted mozzarella. They add fresh garlic and it was overpowering in some parts, and then other parts were flavorless. The tomato could have used at least some salt. 

For drinks my husband had the Muy Bonita lagger, which was average. I had a coctail and it was delicious. Service was great. Not sure if I would return to try other parts of the menu, but cute area. Read more This was our second visit to Whiskeyhill Brewery and Kitchen in Westmont, and it did not disappoint. This time, we had the pleasure to dine with Jacey, who was an exceptional server. The service we received was top-notch and attentive. The food was outstanding, particularly the margarita pizza. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the crust was perfectly crispy. The Electric Duck Hefeweizen beer had a refreshing taste and smooth finish. I definately recommend trying the RAWberry cocktail. Overall, we had a fantastic dining experience and would highly recommend Whiskeyhill Brewery and Kitchen to anyone looking for a great meal and exceptional service. 👍🎉🍕🍻 Read more Ordered the fish platter, fish itself was very good, batter was soft. I was hoping it would be a nice crunchy batter crust. Prime rib sandwich was ok. Ragoon appetizer was very good.  Overall, I would try again. Beers were good, would prefer more choices that weren't bitter or an IPA. They were out of Tony's.  Good value. Read more My husband and I went to Whiskey Hill Brewing & Kitchen - Westmont for a “date night” and it was an excellent dining experience. The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly, ensuring all our needs were met promptly. Red went out of her way to make personalized recommendations based on our preferences. The level of service truly enhanced our dining experience. We were impressed with the craft beers and we thoroughly enjoyed the food.

The good, drinks and staff were exceptional. Highly recommend.  Fun and high energy vibe. Nice location. Great decor. Really limited wine and food menu. Service that is friendly but just misses a bit, likely because of how new the place is. Food was so-so. While our experience was mediocre overall, I would definitely try again once it has been open for a while. Read more We visited during their soft opening - as a formal announcement of being open had yet to be made.  It was a busy evening, with lots of diners. Service was professional but slow - this is expected since the restaurant was only open a few days before our visit.  The food and beer are AMAZING.  I highly recommend Whiskey Hill Restaurant as this will be a destination for downtown Westmont.  We will definitely be back and know the service will align with the great food and environment.

Fantastic food

Server very congenial

Patty sausage deep dish. We will go there again! Read more Very good pizza and great service. Prices are fair seating was very good. Ample parking.  Excellent pizza, vegetable soup, cheesy garlic bread.  Great service from Ava.  They even put the BHawk hockey game on for us.  Pricing not bad.  Only minor issue is parking a bit tight, esp for handicap spots. Will be back! Read more Very good service and food. It was a last minute choice. Glad we stopped in and we’d go back if we are ever down there again.  :)  Service was terrible. They served all of us except one person - our server explained she “forgot” her order. I Ordered a small pizza, they brought out an individual instead. They said they’d make another individual for us. Shortly after that they brought out another individual pizza to make up for their original mistake. After cutting and starting a slice each we discovered they gave us the missing order they forgot - a totally different pizza. Then it took over 35 minutes for her to create our checks and they charged us for two individual pizzas - THEIR MISTAKE - instead of what we ordered - a difference of $5 additional dollars. We had families in from out of town totally looking forward to this and it was a big disappointment. Never again! Read more Excellent service & food. Waitstaff very friendly.  Pizza was delicious with friendly service.   We got the  Numero Uno pizza and are glad we have leftovers for another day!  We got a Small Deep Dish and a large and they were amazing! Great service, we will be visiting again.  When we finally got to order the server did tell us that the deep dish pizzas take an hour to make. This is something we did know and so we ordered thin crust for the kids and asked him to send it out when it was ready and deep dish for us. He told us the thin crust would take 10 mins.

2 hours passed with no food. He kept telling us 10 mins. Finally one of the pizzas came out and it was the wrong order plus the crust wasn’t cooked. He then told us that they ran out of cheese and are making the other pizzas. After another 20 mins nothing else came out and we ended up leaving and getting hotdogs because the kids were starving.

I’ve never experienced something like this before and hope to never again. Read more  We ordered a deep dish pizza and had to wait a long time. I didn’t time it and I know deep dish takes longer but it seemed an inordinate amount of time. When we got it the crust was so hard. It wasn’t burnt, just too hard. You had to press hard with a knife to get through it. My husband just ate the toppings. We complained and they offered to make us a new one. Since we said we would not wait that long the server said he would make a thin crust for us to take home. It was just ok. We won’t negotiate g back there. Read more Only restaurant I’ve seen in a long time that is fully staffed. Food and service both good.  Pizza very good but still not as good as the original.

Had to be sent back. Service just fair  Food was great. Very nice but very small. There happed to be a party of over 30 the night we attended, all teens. Will definitely stop in again.  Place has no ambiance and location is sketchy  Good was good. The service had a lot to be desired. The staff did the best they could, but there were only 2 people to handle the bar and the tables. It’s a new location so I will right  it off to growing pains. Read more Service was slow. One server doing everything. Making drinks, serving food & handling to go orders. 
40 minute wait for pizza. (Usually 30)
Pizza was dry. Will not return. Read more Pizza was okay. Service was fine. Atmosphere was traditional pizza bar.  Thought pizza crust was a little dry. Location is a little out of the way and in a Comfort Inn which appears in need of remodeling. Read more  Perfect spot close to O’hare for a quick layover Chicago style pizza.  Just remember it takes 45 minutes to cook a deep dish pie.  So if you are short on time, call ahead and order one to go, it’s super casual, so I’m sure they would let you eat it there if you have a reservation. Read more Our server was extremely friendly.

Good, quick meal enjoyed on our way out of the city. A bit noisy due to the fact that it is open to the hotel lobby.  Expensive for what you get. A lot better options in area.  Service friendly but did not refill water.
Food okay but not as tasty as expected.  Read more I had to meet a client in Rosemont and didn’t realize this was the hotel restaurant at the Hilton.  There is no unpaid parking there and paid parking is $29.  Strike one.  

The restaurant is a dull, oddly lit space.  It has all the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria.  Strike 2.

The food is overpriced for what you get.  I was going to get the Southwest Salad, but when I asked for dressing on the side, I was told it was pre-mixed.  Fantastic.  I got the Pub Burger instead.  It was pretty obvious that this was a pre-made frozen beef patty.  Not what I expected from their signature sandwich.  There are so many other choices in Rosemont.  Choose them over this place. Read more We ate in the first room to the left and that was excellent. We appreciated the opportunity to chat and laugh together. Waiter was excellent- except he mixed up the steaks. No worries- we’re all friends. Some of our potatoes were crisp and not quite soft enough. One of our group thought her steak wasn’t hot enough. Overall, we appreciated being together and enjoyed the 25% discount offered to us as Conference attendees. Read more We would definitely recommend folks to this restaurant.  Excellent American fare with outstanding service.  The venue was nice.  It’s a hotel venue so most people are hotel guests.   The staff were very nice and the food was good.  Would go back when in the area  Beautiful little spot. Food was very good, but very small. I ordered the grilled octopus as an appetizer and I received one tentacle (about the size of my finger) on bread with some greens. I have eaten in other restaurants in the area and received more food for the same price or less. The wait staff and ambiance were very nice. Read more Appreciate the service and round table for this large group  Emma the host was very accommodating 

Much appreciated!  The drinks were good and my teenage daughter enjoyed her alcohol-free pomegranate mojito. We ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts for an appetizer and the chicken pot pie and fish tacos for entrees. The tacos were cold and the fish was dry. The server sent them back to the kitchen and they made the again. The second time around they came out perfectly - they were hot and the fish was moist. The manager gave us 15% off our bill which was very nice. Our server was nice too! Read more The food was delicious (we went for dinner) and our waiter Ken was fabulous!

Great food as ever a little disappointed that we reserved a high top but we were told on arrival they didn’t have one available  I love Neat for great cocktails and food.
We had the pork bao buns for an appetizer. They are amazing ( we have had the bbq chicken ones in the past and they are spicy).  The cocktail menu changed and I had a spiced pear martini ( yum) they made an off menu aviation for my husband.
We split a dinner salad ( which came out in 2 bowls already). Then I had the caprese chicken sandwich and my husband had the tacos. We had a red blend which was really good.

I had a burger that was very good, daughter had a mini lobster roll that she liked & a salad .
We were there pretty early, 5:30 on a weekday & there weren’t many customers, our server came back several times to check on us & she was very pleasant.
I can’t believe we have lived here for years & haven’t been here before, we will definitely be back. Read more Always a great time at Neat.  Great food.  The servers and staff are top notch which makes the experience and food all the more enjoyable!  We had the most patient young man as our waiter who fielded numerous questions about both food and drink options as to whether or not they were gluten free.  This restaurant is good, but not extraordinary. It is an upscale sports-bar. The atmosphere was good but not fantastic. The service was good, but not fantastic. Very nice outdoor seating area. Extensive beer list - draft, bottles and cans. The Wagyu burger I had was quite good, juicy and flavorful. I would go back if a friend wanted to go there, but I wouldn't seek it out as a go-to place on my own. All that said, there are not many good restaurants in the immediate area, so I would say for the area this one is better than most. Read more Love this place and the manager couldn’t be nicer.

Will go back soon!  What a cool place to go in Edison Park…a lot of fun …  This was our fourth time dining at Weso. The food is very good. The drinks are also great.  We have tried  steak,  seafood  and  vegetarian  dishes and found them to be creative, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Read more Went for EPs restaurant week. Food was very good and decent priced for everything we got. Would come again.  Initially we were excited about the new restaurant in the neighborhood but were quickly disappointed. Edison Park has a Restaurant week where restaurants have fixed menu's so when Wesco was participating for $45.99, we booked our table for a Tuesday night arriving at 6:15 PM
We ordered the Margaritta and Sangria which was a little pricy at $16 each but was good. The appetizer's we had was the Steak Sope and Elote (corn ribs) that were both initially good. One surprising thing we noticed, there was no chips and salsa on the table. We than thought because this was a higher end Mexican steakhouse maybe it wasn't part of the experience. Later after the drinks and appetizers the chips and salsa showed up.  Everything was going well until the time kept getting longer and longer for our main course. The waitress kept telling us its coming but didn't arrive until 7:30PM. The Chille Relleno and Pollo En Mole tasted good but by this time we were hungry and upset it came so late and didn't enjoy the meal the way you might normally. It would have been understandable if the restaurant was crowded but I counted fourteen patrons three Waite staff and two cooks on a rainy Tuesday evening. The waitress and owner acknowledged and apologized for the excessive time but by now the experience had been ruined and we just wanted to go home. Read more Food and drinks were delicious. Steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked. Service was very attentive.  Lovely upscale Mexican steakhouse.  Excellent service by all staff, especially our waitress.  Excellent!

The inside was very chic and luxurious, will definitely be there again for a cocktail and dinner. Read more This was one of the worst dining experiences.

My mom and I got to live the ultimate experience at WESO! From the service, to the drinks, and the food. Everything was absolutely stunning and mesmerizing. Let me start telling you about our waitress “Sheyla”, who went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience being our first time. We ordered the “Piedra” drink that she recommended and it was a 10/10. Not to mention the presentation it came along with. For an appetizer we chose the “pulpo” which was beyond my expectations. The taste was exquisite, tender and very fresh. For our main entree we had another recommendation by Sheyla which was the 36oz Tomahawk Steak! Absolutely delicious! The overall rating of this newly opened restaurant is a 100/10. The aesthetic and theme for this restaurant is very pleasing! I can’t wait to be back with my grandma!

Happy to have a great steakhouse in the neighborhood!  Great food great service we were content with everything  This is an extraordinary restaurant for a celebration or to treat yourself to a wonderful meal. We went to celebrate our anniversary on a Tuesday night - because it was our true anniversary date - and we were so lucky that someone recommended Weso to us. It was one of the best restaurants we have been to recently, and from the moment we went into the restaurant we knew it was the right choice!
From appetizers to desserts, each dish was unique and exquisite. Read more Please use warm plates to serve the dishes. This helps keep the food warm and served at the correct temperature.

Can’t say enough about how great it was. The service, the food, the cocktails…so great!  I was truly impressed with my dining experience. The ribeye was exceptional, cooked to perfection with incredible flavor. The cocktails were not only delicious but also beautifully presented, a true testament to the skill of the mixologists. The empanadas are a must-try; I haven’t had such outstanding empanadas in a long time.

First time there catching their taco Tuesday special which is one of my fav days🥰  It was our first time here we were excited to try out the food because it looked really good in the pictures. However, it had no flavor!! The food is very bland not authentic at all! The Service was not good. When we got there the waiter was confused when we told her we had a reservation.

Read more It took forever to get our food. Appetizers came out second to last and the kid's meal came out last. She was sitting there so hungry. The service was so bad that I might not return which is a shame because the food is so excellent and has such a great selection of vegetarian options. I have gone before when it was called Adelitas and didn't have such poor service. And weirdly, you'd think they be more crowded on Cinco de Mayo. Very disappointing. Read more Amazing!!

The food tasted really good. The music was just a touch too loud but it would not prevent us from returning  Great food and service even in spite of being seemingly short staffed. Place had a nice neighborhood feel with wall deco lifting up the strength of diverse Mexicana women. Temperature was a bit cool by the front of the place, but definitely a pleasant surprise and not what I expected coming to Bridgeport.

Vegan options were tasty and all the food was incredibly presented. PAPAS CRIOLLAS TACOS were good, just not my favorite. Would like to try the AGUACATE FRITO TACOS next time. The SOPES VEGANOS SURTIDOS DE VERDURA were delicious even though I didnt see the black bean sauce. Overall a great time! Read more Reservation was booked, but the restaurant was closed when we arrived and there wasn’t any follow up.

Read more They had the best Vegan Mexican options I have ever had!  Did not enjoy this experience as the first time for some reason. Food was very bland and waitress wasn’t present. Maybe because it was early and short staffed, but would give it another try being I really enjoyed it the first visit. I was highly disappointed in my second visit. The salsa wasn’t flavorful, sold out of avocados once again, & sold out of rice, and no hibiscus tea. Read more The birria torta was delicious! Definitely making this place part of the routine.  It’s unfortunate it could’ve been a better experience if they weren’t understaffed. Gotta give it to the cook and waitress though, they still tried there hardest.

Made it there early and they said they wasn’t taking any customers… horrible customer service  Pros: food was tasty and staff was friendly. Con: It took a long time to get our food.

Read more Inventive and delicious! Go now and bring your friends.  We made a reservation and were excited about trying the menu. When we arrived we were not greeted or told where to go. We approached the counter where a friendly server checked us in and told us she’d seat us in a minute. Several minutes (more than 10) passed until she sat us down. She was very friendly towards the other parties but seemed to have forgotten about us. We didn’t take offense and waited. When we finally got a table, she said she’d be back. Again time passed and we were not given menus, water or some sense of what was going on. Server continued bringing out food and water and tending to the other tables without coming our way. We waved her way and she again must have forgotten about us. After some failed attempts to get her attention and 30 mins without water or menus I walked over to her and expressed my concern and how long we had been waiting. She once more said she was almost going to go to check on us but did not do so.

Had a great time.  The experience was good based on the food and service. It was diminished by the number of dogs that were in the patio area. As large as the patio is there is space to separate dogs from those who do not have them. 
As a person with a pretty severe dog allergy that diminished my experience exponentially.
Seeing a patron put a spoon from the restaurant in their dogs mouth was disgusting and concerning.
Additionally my food was brought out on the same plate as another patron, and we both have food allergies that did not support that practice. 
It would be helpful if in the future the server verified that the food should be put on the same dish. I cannot imagine its conserving that much energy to not put all the food on the same plate.

Someone in our party left their wallet on the table as we went to the bathroom, as we were leaving, one of the workers flagged us down and asked if we were sitting where we were and said they found a wallet and took it up to a manager.

Best to reserva a table, although they might show availability that doesn’t account for the walk in traffic considering the limited seating. Will be back for ramen soon no doubt! Read more WINDOW IN BATHROOM. Don’t bother using the bathroom, there is a window in the bathroom where all the chefs and kitchen workers can see you!!!!! They have a curtain that is split in the middle and doesn’t close all the way, I almost took my pants down and noticed it’s right across from the toilet. I walked out immediately and the cook was smiling at me so creepily. THIS RESTAURANT IS SICKENING Read more Read more Hot and spicy,  but then again, so was my date.  Plan to go again soon!  Was super excited to try this place, as I’ve seen it everywhere on social media. Walking in, the ambiance was lovely. Really loved the intimate space. Sadly, upon checking in for our reservation, the service was horrible. Took way too long to get menus, way too long for the server to actually take our order. Granted, the food didn’t take that long, but the food was not as good as I expected it to be. The ramen was incredibly oily, noodles were not ramen grade ramen, shrimp katsu wasn’t bad, seaweed salad was bland. The tofu buns were not memorable.
Even the table next to us was having issues with getting attention from the server we shared. They asked for water several times and when water finally came, server came to our table instead of the one next to us. After the serve gave me water, I had to tell the server that the table next to us needed their attention. Think they would get water, the server left and took a while to come back with water.

Overall, I wish I could rate this place higher, but I can’t. Service was not good and food wasn’t what I thought it would.

The karaage chicken and pork belly buns were awesome.  We had reservations for an early dinner. The food was SO good!! My son and I are still talking about the dumplings! Yum!  Seating was small for a party of 3 or more. But the food and service was delicious  Very casual but charming ""hole-in-the-wall"" ramen place.

Our server came right away and one of us ordered a coffee/chai drink that took about 20 minutes - unacceptable.  Our entrees also took a long time and were cold when they arrived.  The bacon was inedible, and the hash browns were just glorified McDonalds hashbrowns.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pinched on the river, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.

We love Brooks and have been here a few times.  The outdoor space is covered and somewhat protected - which was nice with crazy wind gusts.  The food, as usual, was great.  I had the chicken salad and my husband had the truffle burger.
Our server seemed new, which was fine, but there were a couple of hiccups.  We ordered a bottle of rosé, which the bartender uncorked for her. she brought it out in a steel wine chiller, and then set it on the table with a glass and walked away.  She didn’t pour any of the wine.
The wine was also not especially cold, so the wine chiller was half filled with ice in what seemed like an attempt to cool it down.
For a half price bottle of wine I certainly wasn’t going to complain, but it would have been nice to have the option of ordering a different, chilled bottle.
Like I said, nothing major, and certainly not enough if a complaint to change my opinion of Brooks overall, or affect our decision to return. Just a little bit of an off night. Read more Love Brooks!  One of our favorite places.  Thought I would try something different and got the chicken club. Disappointed as chicken was dry!

It’s been a top tier date night spot for us the last two years, and we’ve made a tradition of taking our mothers there for Mother’s Day. Made a reservation this year to continue this tradition…only problem was I wasn’t aware they were not serving their normal menu but having a buffet style brunch. The food was delicious but they didn’t post about the buffet anywhere on there socials (I follow) I don’t think I would’ve made the reservation knowing it was buffet style, you want your mom to be served and relax on Mother’s Day. Plus it was $45 no alcoholic drinks included..so I think it was pricey. I hope they don’t do the buffet next year.

Out quick but it was only ok. Staff was nice but because it was empty they were almost too attentive.  Honestly, what happened to this place? This used to be a go-to for delicious tacos and margs - but it’s gone waaaaay downhill. I don’t think the menu has changed since they opened and the ingredients have become way worse.

Wood is more than a name: our wood-fired oven is at the heart of it all, enhancing a dynamic menu of small-plate, American fare, made with the peak midwest farm produce each season has to offer. Though the dishes regularly change, they are defined by a few constants: meat is butchered in-house from humanely-raised animals; vegetables are drawn from local family farms; and all pastas and sausages are freshly made. Lead by our talented Executive Chef Devin Kreller, who is a 6-time Michelin Bib Gourmand winner, Chef Devin uses French-dominated cooking techniques combined with multicultural inspirations such as Asian and Italian to create new dishes.

Located in the heart of Chicago Boystown, we're known for our brunches, and house butchered meats. Come see why our restaurant has been around for 12 years.

Perfect start with our waiter - JJ - until a large table showed up and were obnoxiously loud. Loud because the building is concrete and hard surfaces.

Something was very off for our visit. Our server was clearly inexperienced, unprofessional, and unable to think on his feet.  When I mentioned a 4th person will join us after we've eaten, we were told we may need to move for other guests even though were were at a 4-top. Its no big deal that a barcode is offered instead of a paper menu, but when one of our party couldn't make the app work on his phone, we asked for paper menu. The server brought one out and simply mentioned ""we don't have some stuff"" and walked away without giving a chance to ask what they don't have. A drink at our table was incorrect and the server mentioned there was a bar tender shift change, then alerted the bar tender, who then came to our table very confrontationally to tell us that the drink was made correctly. We were in absolute shock with this confrontation. Our 4th person arrived in time to have an entre with us, and without giving any background on the service, he picked up on the mishap energy and weird service.

No real apologies came or any explanation of what may be happening. The bill was correct. We were on an annual food tour in Chicago, wanting to stop here but couldn't make it on a previous trip so we were really looking forward to it.  It was laughable to watch the server trip over himself, lose his place, come back to verify our first drink order, forget to check on us, etc.  Memorable, but not for the right reasons.

There are some wonderful restaurants in the area, but none that offer authentic food from the southern continent. We made it our mission to create a menu that not only introduces this cuisine to the locals but give the South American population in the area a taste of home. We made sure to use authentic and fresh ingredients, sometimes with a little artistic license, and create dishes not from one country but many. We want to invoke memories of celebrations of past and create new memories for a lifetime.
In addition, we are dedicated to pleasing our coffee loving cult.

They create food from many South American countries. Owners and staff are very friendly and professional.  New spot in the neighborhood and food was quite tasty. Went for brunch and would like to go back to try other meals. Nice little outdoor area for when the weather is nice.  An unpretentious, multi-purpose coffee shop and restaurant with some bigger ambitions on its menu. The ceviche with fried plantains was terrific. And while the Moqueca seafood stew was rich, tasty, and well prepared, the Estofado de Puerco was just big lumps of fatty meat sitting on thin slices of bland, boiled vegetables.

I recommended going here because I had such fond memories of my experiences in the old space in the West Loop. I was so disappointed. The servers were more concerned about turning our table than actually providing quality service (I put ten years into the industry, they were lurking and always annoyed when we asked for more coffee and that my friend was taking her time with her dish). The “This Little Piggy” dish was so salty it was barely edible. The experience overall was not delicious or enjoyable. Read more Excellent food, amazing service, overall a wonderful time. Can’t wait to go back and try more!  The tomato apple soup changed my life and the service was great  Service could have been quicker, but food is unparalleled  Best French toast anyone at our table had ever had. What more could you want?  Consistently good food.  Love their patty melt, and the fries are always crispy  Top shelf, the most creative, delicious breakfast I’ve ever had, and the staff and servers were chill yet super helpful and attentive. Great place!  Fantastic, one of our favorite spots in the whole city and it’s part of a network of terrific restaurants with unique and delicious food, typically great service, lovely atmosphere, and various levels of what you’re looking for in a dining experience. Don’t miss out and don’t skip the okonomiyaki! Read more Food was delicious, not quite like the old spot in the west loop, portions slightly smaller and more expensive (french toast). Glad they still have the hot sauces!  Food and service were wonderful! Will definitely return to try more of their menu.  Read more The food and the service were both fantastic, the burger is to die for.  The food was not great. So over-sauced that it overpowered any other flavors.  Our waitress was very pleasant though.  We were big little goat frequenters back when it was located on Randolph. We even had our wedding reception there. The atmosphere was always fun and up beat, the food familiar yet very unexpected.  It was always a good time and a great meal. What happened?  We had yet to go to the new location on Southport, until last night, but don’t look for it there it’s really on Henderson in back , very confusing. Nothing was horrible, but nothing was special either, it’s lost its mojo. The food was just meh there was no atmosphere it’s a fraction the size, no counter, no bakery no sizzle. I suppose we were looking for the old place, and had certain expectations. New places can’t be the old places. I just wish it hadn’t been relegated to a side street in the back and sadly a shell of its former self.😞 Read more Something was amiss here when we visited. We dined as a couple with our young toddler. Our meals were fairly good overall, but my three year old got a grilled cheese that was scorched to oblivion on the inside. And I mean completely black. Not only was I shocked that someone failed to cook something as simple as a toddler’s grilled cheese, but I was disturbed that it ever would have been allowed to leave the kitchen, much less to be served to a kid. The restaurant rightfully remade it and gave a discount on the bill, but I was a little unsettled thinking about it after leaving. As for service, we had a young waiter who was wonderful, but the guy working as host at the door was openly miserable. And he also seemed to hate kids (in a family friendly restaurant on a kids eat free night). The whole experience was baffling and needs some serious oversight from the head chef/management. Read more We loved the creative, delicious food, friendly service, and funky restaurant interior design. Thank you for a great experience!  Lived up to the hype. Great vibe and unique, delicious food. Excellent service as well.  The food was meh, which was surprising. I thought this was a Stephanie Izard restaurant?My partner had pancakes that were just “ok”.
My daughter felt queasy later from the omelet she had, which was a special. My son said the okonomiyaki was bland. And my salad was very over-dressed. Not sure why I added fried chicken because that was weird as well. Expected bettter so won’t be back. Disappointed. Otherwise, great location, nice outside seating, service was appropriate.

I did miss the ambience of the last location just a bit, but I was not disappointed and I’m pleased the service and quality of food remains excellent. Read more The loaded french fries are worth the visit all alone. Limited menu but well prepared.  We always love Little Goat! We come at least twice whenever we visit Chicago :)  Lots of surcharges and fees, they mention the 4% fee for inflation but they don’t tell you about the 4% easy checkout fee that they have you do.  When it’s all said and done an extra 8% on your bill and a recommended 24% tip for minimal server interaction is ridiculous.

However, service was painfully slow. Server was very polite and attentive once he got to us. Maybe the restaurant should have more staff.  Great food and service! Our server Freddy was very attentive and friendly. We’ll definitely come back.  Halibut was great and so was bread pudding. I would recommend  Excellent food and location.  Very charming for any occasions, personal or business.  The menu was somewhat limited, but the entrees we had were quite good and the servings were very generous for the price.  Wine selection was similarly limited.  The black and white decor was quite striking, but lots of hard surfaces and proximity to busy downtown streets made the noise level fairly high. Read more Went for a pre-show bite. My friend and I split a burger which was very tasty and generous. The chef cut it in half and divided the fries without even asking and that was thoughtful. They seemed to be out of some things on the menu and there was really only one server taking orders etc. there did seem to be. A food runner. Given the short staff and short stock we actually had a perfect quick bite. This is associated with the hotel and sometimes that influences the vibe. The same restaurant will serve breakfast to the hotel guests so it gets watered down in identity. Not fancy but convenient and not bad. Read more I believe there was only one waitress and possibly one expeditor for the whole restaurant.  The bartender didn’t know the common garnish for gin and tonic.  So, I don’t think the wait staff was the problem: I still tipped well. I believe it was management’s fault for improper training, and staffing.  In all fairness, I’ve dined here four times and the other three times were pretty good.

So easy I’d going to a show  Read more We sat outside and service was quite slow. Food was very good. Servers were lovely when they were present which was not often.  so the long and the short of it is that the food was just not good. cobb salad was basically a bag salad from the dollar store maybe? the shrimp toast allegedly had a shrimp paste cooked into it, but i didn’t see or taste shrimp. had to actually ask our server if they forgot the shrimp. cocktails were fine. but so overpriced for dumpy food and mid atmosphere Read more Went for dinner at 6 pm on Sunday. Good service and food for all of us. Only minor complaint is that the mojito was not very good.  Food was only ok and brunch options were extremely limited.  We thought we'd also be able to order from the breakfast menu, but they stopped serving those options at 11:00 (we were there at 11:30am). So note that only the 5 weekend brunch options are available after that time if you don't want lunch.  Service was slow.  We ordered drinks and they took almost 20 minutes to arrive (and the restaurant/bar wasn't packed).  I haven't been to Atwood in years, but with mediocre food and service, I doubt I'd go back anytime soon. Read more Our server, Sandy was great and attentive. We had a lovely experience.  The service was lovely. The food was tasty. A bit spendy but expected in the area.  It was our girlfriend’s reunion and sad to disappoint. As we were all to the pineapple drinks, happy hour menu, but since one of our girls was in a wheelchair, we couldn’t sit at the bar and we were told that we couldn’t take advantage of the specials, how is that? so I called the manager which I feel the waitress should have asked, and then we were allowed. Then one of my other girls got a salad, a dinner salad, which was more like eating grass and two tomatoes and then they forgot the shrimp until we were all almost done eating. So once again, the manager complied. I feel like that waitress was ignoring us cause then once we ordered the dessert, it took forever we almost missed our next stop the theater. I feel like that’s not the right job for that waitress. The manager was nice but honestly it was a bad overall experience my friend that ordered the salad was still hungry and asked for some bread which was loaded with butter toast. ? I was mortified since it was my idea to eat there. Read more Service was lousy.  Had to wait for everything from an extra straw to plates to the food.  Salad had a bug.  Shrimp toast had no shrimps!  They were polite.  I don’t think their air conditioning was on and it was in the 90s outside. I think as sweating the entire time. I felt sorry for the servers. Food was average. Service was lovely.

Great staff. Teenage boys wolfed it down!  I went there with family for my son's b-day. They had private party,  so we got our table in the side room. It was extremely cold in there. Our waiter was taking forever and didn't have much experience. Food was very late and we had to call for every dish we have ordered. Our soup was late, our appetizers were late,  and my mom , an older lady,  didn't get her food with us. She received it almost when we were done with our food which made us very uncomfortable. Also, I wasn't told about yellow banana hot paper in my dish, so most of the dinner I was trying to get that fire out of my mouth. I  didn't feel the taste of any other food after that.  Thanks God, once my mom received her plate, she was alarmed on time, so we got it out of her plate. The waiter thought that was very funny. Our diner some how was overpriced, (we received more rice dishes than we asked for, but  I was too tired to argue about my check...

The restaurant was beautiful and clean, and a lovely welcoming ambiance. The staff were courteous and prompt, brought us glasses an ice bucket to chill wine immediately.

Read more Superb service. The food is amazing.  We went to this place for the first time after reading all the google reviews. However, it was a disappointing experience. The food portions were small, there was an item called lamb stack kabab for $26- what we received was couple of lamb pieces- I think there were 4 small ones.

Waiter was utterly incompetent. It is ok to be inexperienced, but this waiter was clearly not properly trained by restaurant management.

It’s directly across the street from the Chicago Theatre (where we had tix for the America “Ride On” rock concert), and I was hoping for a cool ‘Chicago’ experience. Found nearly the opposite unfortunately.

1. No ambiance: The Tavern was screamingly loud. My friend and I fortunately were seated against a wall, but even though we were ‘kitty-corner,’ we literally had to shout at each other to carry on our conversation.

2) The food was over-priced for its value. We shared 3 appetizers: a shrimp cocktail, a cup of mushroom soup, and an appetizer-sized salad w grilled chicken. Nothing to drink but water (I.e. no cocktails or wine.) Cost was $48!! I mean, the food was decent but nothing creative—very ordinary. And it was $48 (not including tip) for just appetizers?!?!?

3) Our server was competent but not at all welcoming. No effort was made to be upbeat or engaging. She did her job but with the bare minimum of words of interaction with us.

Overall, we had a quick overpriced bite before the concert. I think I’d’ve been happier at ‘Steak and Shake’ instead of ‘State and Lake.’ Read more Fries were soggy and cold.

He even tried to see if the kitchen could split our dishes (we were sharing). They didn't do it (not a huge issue at all), so he brought us extra plates in advance. The food was excellent! Highly recommend the roasted Brussels sprouts with dates. The chicken breast with bacon bread pudding and apple reduction was phenomenal. The sauce was almost like they had liquefied a caramel apple.  Our drinks were good if a bit on the higher price side, but that is to be expected given the locations. All in all, we would definitely eat there again and certainly recommend it to others. If you have a show at the Nederlander, this is also a great location since it's a little over a block away. Read more Service was slow, had a performance to attend.  Broccoli side dish was too hard to eat.  Good atmosphere but the food was just ok. Has the gnocchi which was in a watered down meat sauce that had basically no flavor. Definitely not worth $29 for that dish.  Consistently good food, service and drinks for the many times I have eaten here.  Good service. We had to be out in less than an hour to make the theater and our waitress did a great job.
It looked like a younger after work crowd and the place was very noisy. Read more We had a 1pm reservation for their Easter brunch.  It was clear they hadn’t been busy and the food was hours old.  Overcooked, dry ham and crusty mac and cheese.  Incredibly disappointing all around. Read more Read more The resturant is inside the Wit Hotel.Ambiance is nice, live music friday and saturday. Service was great. Bilingual, polite. Prices are average for the type of place, I feel they could offer something extra to the guest staying to motivate traffic because Chicago has too many places to offer great food and ambiance.
But the sad part was the food. It was blunt, tasteless, good quality proteins but underseasoned and the menu was bit limited. Also few side options. We ordered 4 different proteins, 4 different options,4 different sides and not 1 was good. It was ok, it was bearable but for over $30/plate you would expect great taste. Read more It was dirty and incredibly expensive for microwaved food.  We arrived only to find out that we’re having a special menu that day. Which didn’t work with my diet, but it was a Saturday in Chicago—no one has availability. Our waiter ignored us for most of our time there. We had to flag down other waiters to get what we needed. The food was flavorless—although I will given them props for the creativity of the dishes—they just fell flat flavor-wise. They were also out of 2 of the 3 drinks from their special menu. All in all, it’s not worth the time or money. The DJ was good, but it’s too small of a space for that sound system. Read more It’s was St. Patty’s day river dying.  There was a large crowd downtown.  The dj was great, but we were in the restaurant area and had a hard time talking.   Food was ok.  My nieces eggs in her Benedict were over cooked. As well as the streak which was suppose to be medium rare. Read more Loved the breakfast, great value for the price and amazing service  We dine here often if we have tix around the corner at Chicago Theatre, this time was a bit of a miss.  While we were halfway into our appetizer the entrees arrived - far too quickly.  One entree was the potato gnocchi dish, and this was the first time I have ever sent back food, as the gnocchi itself was like the consistency of of a just opened pillsbury can, that could be smeared across the side of the plate.  Server Jasmine was apologetic (not her fault), and new dish (completely different) came out quickly.  The addition of large (40ish”?) flat screen TV’s directly above the chair line along the walls (if your dining partner was against the wall across from you the tv would literally be right behind them shoulder height) seems like an odd choice, evidently they’re trying to maximize filing sports fans in..?  FYI If you have 7p show tix, the place starts filling up pretty quickly at about 5:45-6. Read more Good food and great service. Perfect timing as we were on our way to the theater.  The food was blah. The shrimp were well seasoned but the grits was underwhelming and needed cornbread to  bring together.  The menu was mediocre for dinner.  My steak was charcoal for a medium well. Our server was awful. Ruined my birthday dinner did not even mention anything about us celebrating a special occasion. Our meat balls were so cold and no flavor. Do not waste your money here such a disappointment. Read more The dj was playing very good music to listen to while having dinner",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/60959391.webp

We were to have the full Churrasco experience but we only had proper full meat service offered once. We spent an entire hour requesting chicken breast which is not the experience that we should have had due to the nature of the restaurant. Having to continuously request service with our cards clearly displayed as green was quite disheartening. My expectation versus my experience was far from what we received.

Meat overcooked, they took forever to bring the meat , the salad bar horrible , the cheeses were dry like they were at the salad bar for at least 2 days. The sides cold , dry . The worst experience with meat at this Fogo. We asked for Medium and the meat was burn on the outside. I will definitely never go back to this particular Fogo Read more Good food, fair cost. Great service by the collaborators  A little disappointed with the steak but the buffet was good and the filet mignon.  Good food and ambience! The service was also very good. Lots to choose from!

The staff was amazing the experience was beautiful the food well seasoned juicy, the options from the MarketSide table were delicious, the sides were good as well!

Manager Carlitos and team treated us like VIPs. The food quality and variety are unsurpassed. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there.  Read more Really great experience. Gauchos were very tentative. Ocean view was great. Carlitos Elvir was even greater.  Two of the serving staff (gauchos) were rude and disinterested in what I wanted and just did what they wanted to do. Had to wait a long time after I sat down and the waiter spoke with me before I got the green / red medallion for meats. Had to wait a long time for anyone to check on me after I turned it red to get my check. Food was delicious, value was good.

However, last night it left a lot to be desired. I went with some friends and family for a birthday celebration and was disappointed to see that there first time at Foggo was such a bad experience. While the meat was coming around quite often sides, as well as the refill service on, the drinks was not. We did not get the sides until halfway through our meal and also some of the meat dishes that were coming out weren’t flavorful as they normally are. The portions of the sides were very small and we had to ask them repeatedly before we got them. lastly when it came time for dessert, it only took a while to get to us, but was also not up to par. Read more Read more Plenty and Delicious food for a very good price.  Today, I received poor service, prompting this review. Initially attended to by one server, then abandoned, I was later assisted by another, with no improvement. The staff's lack of interest was clear, with requests frequently ignored. This led to a 10% tip, less than I usually give. I hope for improvement on my next visit. Read more Servers were slow and rude, polite. It took ages to find a waiter to get a drink usually 20 mins. Of course the food is very good but service stinks. When we had a coffee Irish style for $10,50 and we said is wasn't good we were told it is what it is, no care for feedback or helping us, very rude Read more I really enjoyed Fogo de Chao! The drinks are amazing and you get so much food for the flat fee. Not as expensive as I imagined it would be. I have been back twice since.  This was my first time at this restaurant or any restaurant of the style. Everything was great, food was delicious. The only issue I had was that I expected it to be an upscale restaurant, there were people dressed in shorts, tennis shoes, doo rags, it made the atmosphere not so upscale. But everything else was still great. ￼ Read more I have been to many different Fogo locations throughout the USA. It has been a while since I visited the Chicago Fogo, and looked forward to dinner. Our server was excellent, the salad bar is always beautiful and tasty, but the meat was so SALTY!! I have never had a bad experience ever, and both of us couldn't eat much meat due to salt level. It ruined the overall experience for us, as this was my recommendation for our business dinner, and my guest was very disappointed. Read more Way too busy, meat was burnt and overcooked. Service to table was slow.  We reserved a table for a business meal. It was obvious that they had overbooked the restaurant. We arrived shortly before our reservation, but had to wait until 25 minutes after before we were seated.

They were so busy that we often waited 10 minutes between food being brought around. This made it difficult to enjoy the meal.

The atmosphere was very loud and it was difficult to hold a conversation.

The food tasted very good and lived up to the standard they have at most of their restaurants. Read more Just never could get them to bring the meats

My wife and I recently visited Buca di Beppo for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. We were very excited, unfortunately, we left extremely disappointed. The hostess at the front was less than cheerful, although our server, Carol, was very pleasant. The restaurant itself had a slight musty smell as if the carpet hadn't been cleaned in a while. Carol explained that the portions were family style. Even the small portions were large enough to feed at least three people. We ordered fried mozzarella, chicken parmesan, and their ""famous"" spaghetti and giant meatballs. While waiting for our food, we ordered drinks, an Italian Primo Margerita, and a Sicilian Sunset. Both drinks were incredibly good, the best part of the meal! The food, on the other hand, was less than mediocre. The meatballs didn't taste like real beef, and all of the food was so incredibly bland! No seasoning or flavor whatsoever.

Great food and service. Had some gift cards that I needed to use. Sadly the writing is on the wall for this chain. Orland is closed which was why we had to make the trek to Lombard.

With more than 15 years of culinary experience in Istanbul, Ankara, and Antalya, he brings the flavors of Turkey to the Windy City.

For over six years, Chicago residents have flocked to Istanbul Café for delicious, authentic Turkish cuisine. From mouthwatering kebabs to flavorful mezze, each dish is a testament to Mustafa's culinary expertise.

What set Istanbul Café apart was not just its special wines, homemade baklava, or Mustafa's culinary expertise, but a secret treasure hidden within its menu - the ""Cag Kebab."" This special dish from Turkey's Erzurum region, and you won't find it anywhere else in the city.

From the talented chefs to the friendly servers, they ensure every visit to Istanbul Café is special. Here, we serve you not just with food but with passion! Come and savor Turkey's essence in the heart of Chicago!","Read more Great team and Turkish good, we had an unforgettable night. Big thanks  Frequent diners here . Always enjoy our meal and service .  Great food. The appetizers all were fantastic. The entrees were delicious as well  We just ate here on an August afternoon on the patio, and it was a great ambience! The food was better than I expected, and we really enjoyed the salmon tartare and the zucchini pancakes/fritters. Our only minor complaints would be that the waiters were somewhat quick to clear up at the end of the meal and the road noise/sirens, but otherwise we were really pleased with our experience!

Turkish food for the WIN!  Have been there in the past and thought the food was decent. However, this time it was not great. Salt ￼ levels were not great either too salty or not salty enough, and in general food was bland. French fries were soggy. Best part was the bread. ￼ we came at an odd lunchtime, so they were not busy, but Service was very slow and when it came time for the check and automatic gratuity was added for four people which I didn’t love. Unfortunately will not be back. Read more Excedió nuestras expectativas, un lugar maravilloso con una excelente comida, ofrecen auténtica comida turca.  We had the Sunday brunch experience here. For $30 per person we enjoyed a feast! Best value and taste.  My companion and I were naive to authentic Turkish cuisine prior to dining at Cafe Istanbul. Our servers (both a female and a male assisted us) were helpful explaining the menu items. Since it was a Sunday, only brunch or offerings from the dinner menu were available. It was unclear to us exactly how the brunch ""worked"" for a fixed $30. We ended up ordering 3 entree items that were on the brunch list but not the ""entire"" brunch per person. Our table was one of only two tables seated inside so we couldn't even peek at other tables to see the quality/quantity of brunch dishes. The items we ordered arrived promptly, were freshly prepared and presented with pride. It was clear that our servers were proud of their dishes and were happy to share their culture. We will definitely return to experience a dinner service! Read more Cafe Istanbul had amazing food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary.  Delicious Mediterranean food and great service! Love the outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  Disappointing Lunch Experience

I recently had lunch there on July 4th,  unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment. Here's a breakdown of our experience:

Appetisers:
- Zucchini Cakes and Fried Lamb's Liver: The portions were sizeable, which initially seemed promising. However, the seasonings were rather bland, leaving both dishes lacking in flavor.

Main Course:
- Doner Kebab: The meat was tough and could best be described as shoe leather. It was also devoid of any seasoning. It seemed like the food was prepared ahead of time and simply reheated before serving.

Drinks and Dessert:
- We did not order any drinks.
- We did have one dessert, but it did not redeem the meal overall.

Price:
- The total bill came to over a hundred dollars for two people, which is quite steep considering the quality of the food.

Overall, the experience was far from satisfactory. The food lacked flavor, and the quality did not match the high price point. I would not recommend this restaurant based on this visit.

I was a little disappointed that the inside wasn't more air conditioned, but we still enjoyed our dinner.  The staff was very kind as well.

At $22 a pop, this is a very good deal for a downtown location.  I was happy that they allowed you to select the juice of your choice (OJ, cranberry or pineapple).  Food was good, Lake Benedict (smoked salmon, poached eggs, béarnaise, house made biscuit).  Biscuit was nice and tender and the béarnaise sauce was very good.  I also got a ""side"" of pancake, which was one....should have gotten a full order as it was very good and my daughter dipped into it.  The cake was nice and fluffy and the coloring was great.  I am picky about pancakes and like a certain brown coloring for them and this one was perfect.

My hubby go the steak and eggs and said it was nicely prepared.  My daughter got the Truffle and Wild Mushroom scramble with potatoes (scrambled eggs, truffle oil, sautéed wild mushrooms, sautéed leeks).  She cleaned her plate, so you can say she enjoyed it :-)  She said that the flavors were light and the dish itself was just the right amount of food.

Had the Beet Salad, Steak Skewers, Shrimp Caesar and guac. The wine list nice  Fun outside evening. Shared apps and table food.  Walked to concert afterwards.  Food seemed an afterthought here. My appetizer was clearly a microwaved barely warn meatball on a puddle of unseasoned tomato puree. Salad was a bag of greens with a load of overly pickled beets. 
Noisy and cold.
My partners salmon was skimpy and undercooked on a slick of overcooked spinach. Would not go back. Read more Read more The pork belly was excellent. Everything else was either under seasoned or barely warm. Which would be fine if the price was a bit high and the service wasn’t also very slow. I feel like when they remembered us they tried, however we had 3 different servers. The hostess was very short/rude with us. But it took roughly 10 minutes to get water and then quite a while after that to put in drink and food order.

It’s fine, the ambiance is great minus the loud af cars which isn’t their fault, it’s just medium everywhere else and it has been for years.

Also the menu is a joke, give people paper menus if you mobile one is going to be so difficult to utilize and doesn’t actually size to a phone. Read more This could be a great restaurant, with just a few tweaks. The food wasn’t quite there, string fries were soggy when they should be crispy. Brusselsprouts were way undercooked but the flavor was good,  the au gratin potatoes were a complete fail- basically whole baby potatoes with cheese thrown on top- unimaginative for sure, very underwhelming. But love the actual space and location of the restaurant. We had the crispy chicken sandwich which was quite good! We will try the place again. Read more Went for a date night with my husband and really enjoyed it. Trio Dip was delicious as well as Crab Cake. Service excellent.  It was just ok. I will probably find somewhere else to go on a Friday night.  So many weird ""rules"" to the brunch minosa special, it killed our experience and we would not recommend.  3 of us went for a casual brunch to celebrate a friend getting married next month. Nothing over the top but we wanted to catch up and have some mimosas. First, the mimosa package is advertised as unlimited for $35 as an add on package. Thats great, however what we learned is the 90 minutes begins as soon as you sit down, and you cannot be served a drink before you order an entree. So either you already need to know your menu order when you arrive or if your group takes 15 minutes to decide on their order, that is literally time deducted from your package.  Weird. Next, they do not even bring water initially while you wait so you are rushing to review the menu with no food, no drink and no water. Finally you place your food order and they will bring your mimosa. A single mimosa must be FULLY consumed before you can request your next, so please make sure your glass is empty. Usually you would just think as it gets low they would come ask if you will be ready for another soon, however low is not empty so they will not ask until the glass is empty. What was odd was they also made my friend wait to refill hers while mine was still mid way consumed.  Sorry I don't drink fast..but that shouldn't have impacted someone else's ability to get their next mimosa since her glass was empty. Overall, the experience was very odd. The rules being so confusing made us pay more attention to when someone was getting low on champagne than us actually being able to catch up as friends. I wouldn't recommend this location for a mimosa brunch option and even though we aren't big drinkers, it still seems odd to have so many stipulations around the drinks. If you go, just order regular drinks and enjoy your meal. The package will ruin your mood. Read more I recently dined with friends and had a pleasant experience. We ordered a chocolate martini, a margarita, double bone-aged lamb rib chops, and a side of garlic spinach. The cocktails were decent, though not particularly outstanding. The lamb chops were well-prepared and visually appealing on the plate, with portions generous enough to serve two. The flavor of the meat was excellent. However, the garlic spinach was disappointing; it was overly simple and lacked distinctive flavors—I would opt for a different side dish next time.

Love Jose Andres and his team delivers every time.  Three of us went for the Tomatina Festival - a 1/2 page tomato-based menu from appetizers to desserts.  Knowing they were all ""tapas"", we ordered the entire menu (about 8 items, I believe) - O M G - each was astounding and marvelous.  SO creative and tasty ... not one was ""less than"".  BEST, however, was a substitution for cucumber w/gazpacho -and we had an olive ""thing"" instead - 4 ginormous olives in a small tin - and then four ""other things"" - each in a spoon with a handle - and in the middle of each was something that LOOKED like an olive.  hmm ... seems it was ""molecular gastronomy"" and each little olive had a bit of a ""jiggle"" to it ... put it in your mouth and an EXPLOSION of briny olive oil - LIKE an olive but not.   it was fascinating!  Dessert was a tomato sorbet that topped a ring of olive oil cake bits with strawberry slices in between and topped with ""yogurt foam"" that, again, was unlike anything we'd had before.

The menu is classic Chicago Italian steakhouse; there are good selections of top quality beef, and also good selections of classic Italian dishes, like you'd find on Taylor Street downtown 20 years ago.
The Chicken Vesuvio is a classic, I recommended it to my dining companion, and as usual, it was well prepared, a generous serving, with fresh peas to accompany the chicken and potatoes roasted in wine and garlic... LOTS of garlic.  I had eggplant parmigiana, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover their version was far more refined than I expected.  There were layers after layers of thinly sliced and breaded eggplant, with a perfect marinara.  Better yet, there was no heaviness; the eggplant flavor stood out, and was not dominated by the breading.  Well done!
Desserts were textbook, and classic - creme brulee for my dining partner, and flourless chocolate cake.  
The only item that struck us as subpar was the special French Onion soup - which was a bit lacking in flavor, and definitely lacking in cheese!
A side note - I highly recommend the Moody Tongue IPA that is on tap, made specially for the restaurant.

To summarize, this is classic Chicago Italian steakhouse fare, well executed, with a broad menu that has something for everyone.

My entree was fresh and excellently prepared. We ate outside on the patio which was also a great experience.  Always reliable and great. Steaks chops seafood and pasta’s, can’t miss on anything.  Way too salty and too much garlic.  Should not have to do that in a high cost restaurant.  Nothing wrong.  Nice server and food was fine.
Service was efficient snd my husbands pasta.. bolognese was excellent  Right from the start to making the reservation, checking in, promptly being visited by waiter until leaving restaurant was top notch.  Food selections were good and our choices were prepared to our liking.

The brisket patty melt was very tasty.  Bub City is a fun place, we had a small group and they sat us by an open window booth which was a great location. The area is so vibrant and never seems to slow down.  Great service . Food was just ok. Not real Texas BBQ.
Great vibe for a night out. Noise level necessitated shouting .  Always Outstanding! Great food and an awesome staff!  We have been to Bub City many times and are silver LEY members. Tonight, we ordered the nachos as an appetizer, and they took a while, though we didn’t really notice. The server came over a few times to let us know they were working on it and to apologize for the wait.

The brisket was very tender, and my wife thought the ribs were superior to some of our favorite rib places.  The cole slaw was delicious, creamy, but not too creamy.

I had the butterscotch pudding, very good and just the right size after a BBQ meal.

We have been here a few times and have always had good food and service and when we sit inside that the noise level was a little to high.  But in the warmer months they have nice outdoor seating and often open the windows which helps with the noise.

All in all a good time, food and service. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/5/27920043.webp

Food is phenomenal 👍 And I would say reasonable. Very nice food variety. Service needs to improve. Perhaps waiter was new when he got our order wrong. Ended up getting our appetizer after the entree was served. And potato requested and served was wrong. But I would still highly recommend RC Supply.

I checked in and the staff were very confused .  They offered me a high top and I asked for a regular table.  Again, the staff was very confused.  My party was finally seated at a very small table.  We had to all crowd in at that table.  It was very noisy.  No water was given, no waiter came around.  After 15 minutes I went back up to the front of the house and asked where our waiter was.  I was assured he would be by shortly.  No one came .  What did come was other people’s food.  We were asked several times by a confused young lady if this was our food .  We said no but could she send our waiter over.  Again, she was confused.  No waiter ever came over.  We walked out after a half hour.  Save your time unless you like confusion.  This place is horrible! Read more Food was amazing as well as service and not expensive  The general manager was very nice. The waitress was very nice. The food was delicious. We were blessed.  The food was delicious & everyone’s polite & courteous.
The prices are reasonable & the variety of the foods are good. I enjoyed our dinner very much .  Let's see.
We're seated fast only to be completely ignored for at least 10 + minutes.
Was ready to walk until someone finally acknowledged our existence.
Chicken parmasean was lukewarm and dry with no flavor.
Fish and chips were very good however.
Portions however were huge and prices were low considering how much you got.
The service was good once we actually got it but it's frustrating to sit there when you first arrive and be ignored which sets a bad tone. Read more Large portions, great service, outstanding food, extremely reasonable prices.  Food was very good and delicious. Very loud and bustling, especially in bar area.  This is the second time going to the restaurant and I have to say the first time was better. The menu is the same, great variety, but the service still seems a little inconsistent. Especially in a casino where it behooves management to get you back out on the gambling floor, service is meh at best. Too long a wait between ordering, to the point where we had to ensure that we were ready to provide charge as quickly as possible. Waiter was pleasant enough when there, but we were also not helped being in the far room. Food is starting to be served less than the heat I expect for this type of restaurant. Broccolini was actually cooler than lukewarm and undercooked. Meat loaf barely acceptable. This goes back to attentiveness of service--felt like food was sitting for a bit. Lots of promise here, but not trending great after 2 visits. With a killer like Hugo's (never less than excellent) in the same building RC Station needs to up its game.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  No fuss ambience inside the restaurant. Service was just okay but they are working on it and we could tell some of them are a little green. Everyone was pleasant though and we were able to get what we requested.
Huge portions for sure so keep that in mind if ordering apps or you want to save room for a particular dessert.
We were a party of 4 and ordered 3 apps.  Calamari was just okay, the Bang Bang shrimp was really yummy with a spicy aioli sauce to dip, and the Tuna Crudo was also excellent with light wonton chips.
Everyone really enjoyed their entrees and they were large as mentioned plus shareable if you like to split entrees to try multiple dishes.
Meatloaf, Roast Beef sandwich, Salmon and Skirt Steak were the mains.  All cooked as requested and everyone enjoyed the entire meal overall.
They also have really tasty buttery pretzel type buns they bring to the table that’s served with a creamy butter so make sure you receive it.
If you like French fries, they were excellent and plentiful. Cocktails are all pretty solid.
We’ll definitely be back! Read more We were very p0leased with our meals.  The snapper was very very good, great flavor.  The bang bang shrimp was perfect and pelntiful.

Great place, happy to have a new restaurant in the area.  Service was good, the food was wonderful, we will be back.  Food and drinks were excellent!  We were less than impressed on many fronts. The first being that the hostess, bartender and some servers wearing their masks below their noses. Secondly, we ordered grilled calamari for an appetizer - there was little to no flavor; and it was served in a piping hot skillet with oil that actually popped and landed on my face. We also ordered a salad and had grilled salmon added to it. The salmon tasted awful. And while we appreciate them taking it off our bill, we were disappointed that the salad itself was pretty underwhelming. Their beer list is pretty weak - especially with so many great breweries in the area - how have they not partnered with some of them?? Their cocktail and wine list left much to be desired as well. There are so many great restaurants in the Chicagoland area and this is definitely not one of them. Read more We love it! Everything was awesome, we are coming back definitely!

Thank you  It was good just the music was too loud. Overall it was good  Excellent food and service. We had a table of 8 and it was no problem for the server.  Great food, great service and wonderful experience.
Ricardo is a special restaurant owner.  The table condiments on the table are not regularly cleaned. The olive oil container was so gross & sticky that we refused to use it. That was a very concerning start to our meal.

The server was not knowledgeable or attentive. We had to wait 20 minutes after we got our check to pay it.

Antipasti:
The arancini was way too salty & the filling inconsistent like it was mixed very well.
The clams were good.
The antipasto was very tasty & was portioned very generously.

Paste:
The Lasagna Bolognesse needed  a lot more sauce. It appeared that they put the sauce on the plate & then placed the lasagna on top of it. There was no sauce on the top or sides. We asked for more sauce to be added when they wrapped it for us to take home & although the woman said she would add more, none was added.

The Tortelli di Mare is described in the menu as follows: ""Crabmeat & mascarpone stuffed pasta tossed with shrimp, calamari, scallops, clams, and creamy brandy shellfish reduction."" The pasta were two inch squares that had so little stuffing that we couldn't even taste the crab or marscapone! They were three small pieces of shrimp, not even one whole one! The two scallop pieces were smaller the size of a raisin & we saw nor tasted any clams. There was way too much calamari in proportion to the other seafood. So, it was basically calamari with unfilled paste squares & pieces of tomatoes & carrots.

With two glasses of red wine, we walked away $142 poorer for a very unsatisfying meal in a very loud & crowded setting. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/53164080.webp

What a beautiful setting! Food is really good with an interesting menu. Everything is homemade, salad dressings are delicious!  Service was too slow on Sunday morning.  Out of seven , coffee was offered to two guests only.  We ordered extra toast and did not come until we were about to leave and had already paid the bill.
We have been to this many times and always have been good except this time,  We had guests from out of town and told how good this place would be.  But, the slow service made us feel embarrassed. Read more Our server was not at all great for our table of four
I drove forty miles and it was my reservation
No bussing, had to ask three times
Food was not served all at once for the entrees

I was not happy at all

My meal came with the salad and that was cooked under the warmer and it was not edible

So I did not eat it

Food was great and the entire facility has a great vibe.  The service was pretty bad but that’s what happens when all the staff are teenagers. Didn’t see the manager anywhere. The service and food took a long time to get to us. We looked forward to getting some sandwiches because of dietary restrictions - but they had changed their dinner menu and failed to update it on their website.

Was told - by many friends and family to go to Lou's for their Deep Dish Pizza. Was so worried that there would be a long wait - and was pleasantly surprised to arrive at 1:00pm on a Tuesday in August - and got seated right away! My son and I wanted to experience ""Chicago"" Beef Sandwich and Deep Dish Pizza - and got Both! We ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich with Mozzarella and Peppers - and au jus for dipping - came with a salad and fries - and it was PERFECT while we waited for the Pizza - which - takes 30 minutes and we were more than willing to wait for perfection!

Thank you!  Very disappointing. Had I not been a long time Malnatis fan, I probably would never go back there again. Restaurant was not busy-we walked in – and we had a reservation. However, it took 45 minutes to get 2 thin pizzas. Bartender was also the waiter, but seemed more focused on the bar area. We asked three people to check on our order and they never came back to us to give us an update or offer any excuse- they just ignored  the situation  until the pizzas arrived, and even when he brought it to the table, he didn’t say anything. Will continue to order carry out, but not eat at this restaurant location in the future. Read more The deep dish extra cheese pizza now has the same amount of cheese as thin crust.

We arrived at the restaurant at our reserved time and were told that it was an hour wait for our table and that the reservations were simply a wait list and first come first serve. Not clear on their open table. However, food was consistent with previous experiences Read more We had a reservation for 6:30 and sent a pre order earlier that day (the restaurant suggests this since the deep dish can take a while to make)

When we arrived, I gave the hostess our name and she said it would be a 45 minute wait and that we needed to do a pre order. I explained, we already had a reservation and sent the pre order in. She then said, it will still be 45 minutes. I asked if there was anything we could do, she said well we just have to wait for the other tables to clear (there were plenty of open tables..) I then explained that we already sent in our order (I was worried, when she originally said we needed to do a pre order as if the one we sent earlier wasn’t acknowledged)

She then said, we could sit you now but we don’t have a high chair. I said, that’s fine and we could manage with a booster seat. She agreed to seat us and when our server got to the table, she said our pizza would be ready in 10 minutes (I was happy our pre order was in fact acknowledged)

The food was good and the service was fine.

But, the hostess and so called manager standing next to her (ignoring the entire interaction) killed the vibe a little.

We took our six kids there for our 18 year old's birthday. I called in the pizza order earlier on that day to simplify the order, make sure we weren't waiting for too long. For context, we had a 6:00pm reservation and I explained to the person on the phone that we wanted the pizza ready at 6:30 to give us time to order appetizers when we sat down, then have the pizza follow.

Unfortunately, our server didn't even come to take drink orders until 6:20. We sat there for 20 minutes without water (never even got water the entire meal), drinks or anyone looking in our direction.

To make a long story short, we didn't receive our drinks until the appetizers, salad, and yes, pizza came out all at the same time.

The front of house needs to be more organized. A busboy served us water. We then waited 15 minutes and finally flagged a server who did not know who our server was, so she decided to take our order. She was very nice. 

The drinks (Margaritas) took a long time and were not very good for the price; we could hardly taste the tequila. This is the first Mexican restaurant we've ever visited that charged for chips and salsa! Eight dollars! 

The food was delicious and the portions were generous. But, it took a long time overall to be waited on and served. Read more The customer service was wonderful and the ambience of the space was lovely. My only complaint is that the food was a bit lacking in flavor.  Pricey, bland food for the money.  Guacamole is decent and the tacos are passable-barely.  Had a brisket torta that didn’t seem to be seasoned at all.  Really disappointed.  The food was overpriced and not very good. It wasn’t bad, but not anything you would want to return for. Al Pastor tacos should have some spice to it, but have sweet pineapple to balance it out. Theirs did not have either and was bland. The enchiladas were borderline dry and definitely needed to be smothered in sauce to balance out. The guacamole was good, but that should be table stakes. The avocado salad was good and fresh, but it seems like it was one of the only good aspects of the former Rosebud left over.

The ambiance was blah. The second floor dining area had no sound absorption, which made conversations difficult. The walls were simply painted in a color conducive to Mexican fare, but there was no other decorations to break up the sterile feel. The lighting was harsh and look/felt like a spotlight when you were right under the tiny can lights.

The service was incredibly slow, but not because of the individual server. They only had three servers for the entire dining floor, and one was borrowed from another restaurant. Management was trying to help out, but it was definitely strained.

This all goes back to what it appears to be: a money grab. The location makes it attractive to tourists looking for a good, reasonable place to eat. No one would think that Mexican cuisine would be expensive, so people wander in. The drinks were small (small glass, lots of ice) and about 30% more expensive than they should be at another restaurant. The food was much more expensive than the quality should allow (~$300 total tab for five people, when two of them were small children). The low staffing leads to higher profits, especially because tourists aren’t repeat customers that would be affected by the service.

I left the restaurant with my daughter only for the server to run after us screaming that I was cheap and had not paid my check.

2 hours waiting for a pasta. Never ever.  Excellent food but the patio area can be loud w cars driving by and people waking by.  The patio is cute but small, which is fine.  It is sandwiched between the front entrance and the street.  Traffic volume was minimal with cars, but heavy foot traffic takes away from the ambiance of the outdoor patio.  As did, in our case, the frequent car alarm going off. Service was exceptional and some of the food was phenomenal.  The pizza was to be desired being undercooked, not very warm, and was very bland in flavor. However the burrata on top was delicious. My recommendation is to skip the pizza and order the Bolganase.  I might give the patio another chance down the road, but it was a very disappointing experience.  If I come back any time soon I will definitely try one of the other indoor restaurants.

The long version:
There is security everywhere so it just feels kind of uncomfortable. You get stopped at the front where they scan your ID and give you a hand stamp, then you go through metal detectors (my husband had to run back to the car because we brought in a birthday present that included a sealed food item), and then there is security standing around throughout (including two guards on the way to the bathroom which is located upstairs and down a hallway… not the best location for a bar restroom, but they’re definitely catering to the VIP section upstairs). Right away we were made to feel on edge… not the best start to a bday celebration.

Service was slow, but luckily they have beer towers so we just ordered that and some shared plates for the table at the same time. The nachos would have been good, except they had clearly been sitting a while since most of the chips were soggy. The pizza and wings (while they also came out at room temperature) were good, though.

At its heart, I did enjoy the idea of the place: high energy, large and plentiful screens, and a fun place to watch football. However, there are a ton of bars around there that don’t have food and drink minimums, time-limits for bar seating, or security staring you down every time you move. Read more It’s just too loud.

Has a banner that updates scores like the New York stock exchange, scrolling with all sorts of stats.

The place was busy before a concert at Wrigley and they seemed to be caught a little off guard. Service was efficient and they tried their best I could tell. I know the service industry is still getting back and having staff resources can be difficult so patience may be needed when first sat at this restaurant. That said when things got rolling the drinks were well made by a bartender that knows what they’re doing and the food was excellent.
Had the quesadillas and pastrami sandwich and both were phenomenal. I would definitely go here to watch my favorite team on the big screen and take in the excitement this place generates.

I come to arrive at the restaurant 10 mins before my reservation like a good customer. Greeted by the host at the front who seemed to be judging me and my wife's age and stature. I tell the host that i have our dinner anniversary for 6pm. She tells us to wait for our table to be ready and i see her go over to a table and set it up for us by herself. The location was not packed at 5:50pm. I watched her for 10 mins go and fix our table while taking her sweet time and throw some very unnecessary confetti on the table as you can see in the picture before seating us. All of the silver wear and glasses were smudged and had water marks as if they were still dirty or barley clean and left in the sun. As seen in the photo. There were not that many customers other than us so we assumed we'd be served quicker on a non packed day. Multiple servers passed by us without acknowledging us or even being our main waiter or waitress for our dinner. Not even stop to  serve us water while we wait. 3 parties come in after us around 6:10-6:17 and we have still been waiting in our seats for any waiter or waitress for almost 30 mins to take our order. Each of these parties are met with a waitress that take their orders and give them water. The last party was sat by the host who gave me a rude smirk as if we shouldn't be eating here. The table next to us was being served by an African American woman named which i heard by ear, (so i can be wrong), was tyna or tina and we were definitely in her section because she was serving all the tables around us. After she took the couples order next to our table she didn't even acknowledge us and walked away after seeing us sitting there for almost 30 mins.

I was recommended a house specialty that turned out to be a grilled chicken fillet smothered in a disgusting layer of melted cheese. I ended up scraping off the cheese and eating just the chicken. The sides of rice and beans were bland and lacking any flavor.

The only saving grace was the margaritas—they were fantastic. Unfortunately, the service didn’t match up. Our waitress was overly intrusive, checking in every couple of minutes to ask if we wanted more drinks, which quickly became annoying.

I've been to Café El Tapatio before, and while it was never amazing, it was at least decent. But after this experience, I don't think I'll ever return. It's gone from decent neighborhood Mexican food to really, really bad. Read more Great food on a gorgeous Chicago night with good friends!  Always great service and food. The patio is nice and large so often has seating available. The last two times we’ve had the same server and she’s been great. Highly recommend the margaritas. Also save room for dessert and grab a fresh churro! Read more We have been to El Tapatio many times with our family.  However, the last several times we noticed that the quality of food is not nearly as good as it used to be.  

Service:  We found the hostesses were not particularly welcoming or even smiled when we checked in even though we were punctual and pleasant.  However, the waitress was very energetic and nice. 

Atmosphere - It was early (5:15) and our D.R. was  filled with families with children.  However, one table had a baby the same age as our grandson and he screamed throughout the entire meal.  It was so noisy we wish someone on the staff would have asked one parent to take the child out to calm him down so not to disrupt everyone else in the room. After they finally left, the diners all seemed relieved.  

Food:  Nothing tasted like it was made fresh.    All entrees were lukewarm, flavorless and lacked any quality.  I had a burrito that scarcely had any meat in it (it was almost flat) and the same with my husband's entree.  The rice probably sat on a steamer table as were the beans.  None of the 4 entrees looked appetizing but thankfully we had drinks. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/64700961.webp

Waited 20 minutes before we were seated even though we had reservations.
Server was never available when needed, his knowledge of the menus and drinks was disappointing, he would have to leave and and ask someone else again and again.
The server’s only concern was a 20 % mandatory gratuity charge. Very disappointing experience for the amount of money we paid. Read more First time in since they remodeled. Menu was easier to navigate and food came quickly and orders were correct. Service was a little perfunctory but overall a good experience.  Easy reservation, very nice server. Noise level not too bad at table area. Guy taking group's photos may add significantly to the final cost. Would go back.  Went to play pool and was surprised to find out they replaced the pool tables for shuffle board and darts. Nevertheless we decided to give shuffle board a try and after the 3rd we began having issues with the sand and the pucks getting slowed and stuck. We asked the concierge for help and she said we had enough sand to keep playing and walked away. After a few more try’s we attempted to fix the sand ourselves. We removed the piles of sand from the board to then dust it back on. The Concierge quickly came over with an attitude and told us we couldn’t do that and that she would fix it. She added a dusting of sand and walked away. She didn’t bother to stick around and make sure the issue were fixed (they weren’t) because she left half the board empty. We began dusting the empty spots when the very nice server notices and told us she would get a manger for us. By this time we had wasted most of our 1 hour of play time just trying to get the board right and we just wanted to leave. Waste of time and money Read more Got sat fairly quickly (party of 5) there weren’t many tables (about 4 counting us) and bar was empty. Waited a total of 20 minutes before our server Fabio came to greet us, he’d already walked past us numerous times before any acknowledgment.

The waiter was great and getting so frustrated with the bar. It didn’t seem that they had a waiter station for water and soda either so waiters had to wait on bartenders for that also. We chose this place based on the proximity to the stadium and we loved the menu. Food was great and on time so if you are going for food it would probably be fine but don’t go for drinks too if you are sitting at a table.

Overall would come back cause I’m still thinking about that veggie burger, but would maybe hope for a different server Read more We grabbed a quick dinner before heading to a concert at Fields Stadium. Everyone was lovely even with it being extremely busy. The veggie burger and dry rubbed wings were on point. Thanks for a great experience! Read more We went before concert, had reservations . The host tried to put our party of 5 in a booth, meant to seat 4.  We requested a different table and it went downhill from there.  The host eventually sat us, 30 minutes later.  Then we waited 30 minutes, no server came.  I had to go the wait station and request a waitress. We ended up with our food 1 and 1/2 hours after we arrived. Yes, we spoke with manager, drinks and partial comp of dinner.  The food was decent, poor customer service is inexcusable.  Busy night or not, the customer’s expectations of service should exceed their expectations, not ruin their dinner. Read more Good food, but they have limited staff so service wasn’t amazing  Great burgers. Interesting wings. Servers etc all extremely nice and attentive. Things were a little slow but kept coming over saying sorry for the wait but really was not a problem. Bus of 30 arrived before we got there so all good. Great beer selection. Being in Chicago, I thought prices were very good. Fries not included so remember that. Nice bar atmosphere. It was nice day so they opened front windows so felt like you were outside.

Server told us it was always that loud.  Went for dinner before a concert. Took 20 min for a waiter to even acknowledge our presence, then never got us water, we had to get our own at the bar. It took 55 min from the time we sat until we got our food. We told the waiter that we were on a time crunch, and he was still very delayed on serving us, getting our bill, and returning our credit card.

The food does not have to be elegant, complicated, or fancy. We find that busy people like simple food—the busier they are, the simpler the food. Our menu is straightforward, down-home Southern food with a few more contemporary dishes.

Getting back to the table allows us to love and nurture each other and renew connections to our families—however they may be configured—in this diverse and ever-changing society. Such connections are crucial in a fast-paced world where we feel more disconnected every day. One of the best ways we know how to restore that daily balance is to sit down at our table.

We should all think about returning to the sanctity of the table, where we can rebuild our families whether they be given or chosen, and reconnect with those we love and choose to love. Our table is a familiar, uncomplicated, friendly place where we can celebrate.","Read more The food was surprisingly tasty, but the restaurant was very drafty. I understand its location is Navy Pier but this is Chicago; and it gets chilly at night. So as a suggestion, close your patio doors so that your interior customers food won’t get cold while dining. If I wanted to dine outdoors I would have asked for patio seating. Also the alcoholic drinks were a bit overpriced but I guess that’s due it’s located at Navy Pier… Read more Lunch Special:  Salmon was well prepared with lovely sauce over a bed of sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Fried chicken and mashed potatoes was also a hit.  Chicken moist with flavorful breading.  Potatoes were creamy and delicious.  Choose Chef Art’s half salad for both.  Always a favorite.  Our server, Leslie, is a gem.  Knowledgeable about menu, efficient, hospitable, attentive without hovering. Read more Great food love the biscuits and deviled eggs.  Had the best Mac and cheese  Very pleasant, good service, clean, attentive wait staff  Sumptuous dinner! The Fried Green Tomatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Too often, they are served soggy and moist. These were not, and the dressing added a richness. The Deviled Eggs were creamy but not runny and mustardy but not overwhelmingly so. One of the diners in our party had the Catfish, and said that it was among the best they've ever had. Several diners had the mashed potatoes and touted how much they reminded them of something one might have had at Grandma's table. Three of us had the fried chicken sandwich, and it was one of the best pieces of fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was crisp, and yet the chicken was extremely moist. I opted for the pimento cheese grits, something I have never had, but something that I will crave until I can have it again. The highlight of the night seems to be something I missed out on, the hush puppy. This was no lump of dough dropped in a deep fryer. Everyone at the table who had a bite said it was absolutely the star of the entire dinner. Our server was superb! The decor was homey and a bit kitsy, but apropos for the comfort food menu. The only drawback to the atmosphere is that it is a bit echoey, and can get a bit loud when crowded. Read more Food was very good particularly the biscuits. The wait staff was very helpful and nice.  One of our pieces of chicken was undercooked and needed to be sent back. The biscuits (which are always good) came out warm not hot and without butter because “last night’s prep team didn’t get the honey butter made” according to our server. Still, the burger and Avocado toast were tasty and the fries very crisp and well seasoned. Server was attentive. Read more Food was good however  service was lacking. Our waitress didn’t bring silverware, napkins, or refills.  Patio reservation; asked for bench, after sitting on the most uncomfortable chairs ever, we asked if we could move to a bench; hostess claimed there were non available, even though we saw some empty across from us.
Ordered Caesar salad to split; it arrived with no dishes or utensils; after asking several people, it took at least 10 minutes to receive...minutes later the entree arrived early since we just started our salad.  We sent entrees back.  Food was average.

I ordered the French toast and wasn’t even given syrup with it. I couldn’t even ask for some because the server came once every hour (or so it felt). By the time she came around I was done eating. We bought the mimosa wristbands which state they’re $35 online but the server claimed they were $40. Once again, we kept having to look for her to refill our jug.

They charge an AUTO gratuity of 20% AND a card fee. I suggest bringing cash. If you pay with a card it still prompts you to leave even more tip.

Food good to great

Only issue—waitperson spoke final bill amount out loud as she explained handheld payment device for the husband to pay the bill. 

Tsk tsk… this may have been unintentional however one of our guests became VERY uncomfortable knowing this. It was embarrassing for us. Is there any way for you to alert your staff about just how uncouth it is to loudly state amounts of a bill?

It was hard to find parking. There was no one at the front desk when we arrived. We stood there waiting for 15 minutes. We were not taken to a table, rather just told to find an empty space. We wound up outside at the rear of the place. It looked abandoned and we were concerned that wait staff would forget about us. After waiting another 20 minutes a waitress tells us she’s sorry because they’ve run out of silverware, plates, glasses  and they are short staffed. She says people are everywhere. Another 20 minutes go by and we get drinks. We order and after an hour we get dry shrimp, rubber steak and a Cuban sandwich. The food was absolutely awful and not edible. We ordered six items and only got three. Then a strange man walked up to us selling something but he should not have been in the restaurant bothering us or the customers around us.

Was not very knowledgeable to be the manager. It’s 2024, food allergies and vegetarian/vegan options should be standard even with a preset menu, particularly on a non-refundable pre-paid experience. After a bit of back & forth the manager did accommodate the vegan guests but I felt the discussion was rude and embarrassing. The staff as a whole was amazing, fantastic service & decorum until then.

He did not seem happy to be there, which I get but he was not nice at all :( We were rushed at the end as he asked if we wanted boxes while we were still eating.

The food was great and the performance flawless  Great place but you clothes take the smell of fried food and they smell bad for days !  BENIHANA Restaurant Review:

Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3 out of 5)

Food: ★★★★★
- Excellent quality of meats, seafood, and vegetables
- Fried rice with vegetables is particularly delicious
- Perfect balance of flavors and seasonings

Service: ★★☆☆☆
- Slow and disorganized
- Long wait for tables even with prior reservations
- Unequal attention from the performance chef
- Poor communication between kitchen and service team

Atmosphere: ★★☆☆☆
- Attractive interior design but needs maintenance
- Major issue with the ventilation system (food smell sticks to clothes)
- High noise level
- Variable social experience: During our visit, other people at our table were unfriendly, negatively impacting the social experience that is a key part of the Benihana experience

Value for Money: ★★★☆☆
- Relatively high prices
- Food quality justifies the price, but service and atmosphere issues reduce overall value

Conclusion:
Benihana offers a unique dining experience with impressive live cooking shows. The food is excellent, but there's room for improvement in service and atmosphere, especially the ventilation system. The hibachi table design requires sitting with strangers, which can significantly affect your experience depending on who you share the table with. Suitable for special occasions or for a different dining experience, but may not be the ideal choice for a quiet meal or those sensitive to strong food odors. Read more Went for my granddaughter‘s birthday dinner. Overall, the experience for her was good. Prices was a bit expensive went to another Benihana’s  in another state with way better pricing and a little more excitement during the dinner process with cooking the food but overall she enjoyed it. On a scale of one to 10 I will give a solid 4 1/2 but the staff was super friendly and nice it was super clean and quiet, but I’ve  been to other locations that were little more livelier and engaged a little more during the whole dinner process. ￼ Read more The hostess team at the entrance wasn’t very welcoming, but everything turned better with our waitress and chef!

Ordered the taquitos with chicken, tacos al pastor, and the el burro bowl. The taquitos were surprisingly filling and five was the perfect amount.

Q was a great waiter!!  Review for Wilma's Famous BBQ & Tavern
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

If you're looking for great food and drinks, Wilma's Famous BBQ & Tavern should be at the top of your list. I visited during happy hour, and let's just say I walked in and stumbled out— in the best way possible!

I ordered the Fred platter, which gave me a variety of options to sample, and everything was fantastic. While they don't offer traditional BBQ sides (just fries), the flavors were so on point that I left fully satisfied.

Whether you're craving BBQ or just looking for a fun time with great drinks, Wilma's delivers. Highly recommend stopping by! Read more So the only reason I gave it a poor experience is because there was none! We actually didnt even get to experience the restaurant because they closed it early on the day that I made reservations & told me about them closing the day before! This was a birthday celebration with family so I couldn’t reschedule. I dont understand why I would be able to make reservations on the website & open table if there was a previous event scheduled. Read more The food was very good but the service was horrible our waitress only checked on us once she never asked about drinks or if we needed anything until the end of the meal. For a place to charge gratuity as part of bill you would think the service would be infinitely better. Because of  that I would tell people to reconsider this place.

Ordered strip steak. It’s 16oz . Requested medium cook. Came to table more medium well. Steak was highly seasoned. A little too much for my taste.
Potato option server gave was smashed or baked. I chose smashed which is just a mashed potato with some skin left on.  Also choice of soup or salad. Chose carrot cake for dessert. It was good. Slice is not big. So it may not be enough to share.
I don’t think I would recommend the steak especially since they say their prime which comes with prime price. It was good but not great. I probably should have sent it back due to temperature.
Sandwiches that were served at other tables did you good. Prices in line with most restaurants for sandwiches.
The patio has a real wood-burning fire pit, which was lit due to the evening, starting to get a little cooler.

They offer to pre-order from their menu and I would 100% recommend it to anyone, as those deep dish pizzas take a while to process. The pizza quality is pretty good, but I think the only thing holding it back from being great is the crust. The crust felt very dry and bland, which I think affected the overall Chicago-style pizza experience for me and my group. However, I believe the price is very fair for what you can get.

The bad (very bad actually) was the server’s attitude and service towards us as customers even we were polite and respectful (we said thank you when we were provided menu, water and food even received the bill) as below:

1. The server did not serve us bread and olive oil, salt, pepper, etc. what are standard before main dish. There was a table next to us who came after us. There were served by the same server bread, olive oil, etc. as one could see. We waited for good 15-20 minutes and saw what other got,  I asked for those. Then, we were served with bread and olive oil. That was it. No pepper or salt.

2. Server did not refill water at all.

3. After we finished eating, the dirty dishes were piled up next to my left side very close to me with a knife pointing to me uncomfortably. We have a small table. However, the server took the bill first. The dirt dishes were taken by another lady. The server did not even care about the dirty dishes were still sitting next to me with a knife pointing to me when he set them down there in the table.

4. We only got a to-go bag (we packed our leftovers as we were not feeling comfortable and wanted to leave ASAP) after we packed our leftovers and waited for several minutes and finally as the server to give it.

Even with all the facts stated above, I give a tip that was a bit more than 10% thinking that he may have a family to support.

Make it a point to eat here every time I come to Chicago.  The food is very good and the service was ok. My only complaint is that there was no one at the front desk when we walked in.

It was fun watching the robot food runners. I’d recommend this place on the quality of its food and little else. Read more I think the good quality was the most questionable.

This is a tired Hotel restaurant that should just be shut down. The food was reminiscent of Dennys, they didn’t have half the items on the menu and the food was gross.

I don’t know why they even kept this open. It’s needs to be shut down and reimagined. The fixtures, furniture and decor is old and out dated.  You can’t run an establishment like this in Chicago.

I've been to Bella Napoli about a half dozen times and this is the first time I was disappointed. True, most of my visits have been for lunch where there's a different cast of characters - servers, managers, bartenders, etc. and everything has been five-star. Our first dinner visit was also five-star, but this visit just wasn't up to their standard. I believe our server was new, but if not, she really wasn't on top of her game. Had to ask several times for different things, didn't seem to understand questions we asked about the menu. She was pleasant enough, but just needs more seasoning.

The service and food were great! 14th and Parrish has a great aesthetic.  I visited them on Sunday and service was horrible. I waited almost an hour for a table for 2 when I had a reservation never got water offered to me nor did the waitress even ask me for my order. I try to support black businesses but this by far was theeee absolute worst customer service ever. I did complain to the hostess but that went on deaf ears. I will not be back anytime soon. Read more Very nice dining establishment and very attentive staff. Food was absolutely phenomenal and priced right!!!  Service was good, the food was good. Will go back again.

The Hyde Parker drink is the best rum drink in the city!  Our server was pleasant and attentive. The room was a bit loud; however, that might be normal for the age of the crowd (20s-30s).  Absolute best burger in Hyde Park. Unless you want it well done, you need to order it rare! It’s always overcooked, but it’s still one of the most delicious burgers in Chicago.  Read more Always a great time, brought my family from out of town and they enjoyed it as well. Always will be a favorite for sure!  We dined after a concert as out of town guests and we left wholly impressed! The ambiance was super cute and definitely upscale Caribbean vibes! They were open late night & used a limited menu for their late hours. The food was so good! Definitely try the mango jerk wings & veggie patty! The hospitality was genuine from the staff! Everything we had was delicious—except the mac & cheese (needed more seasoning & a bit dry). The restrooms need frequent attention as well. Overall, I can’t wait to return to try more food! Read more The ambiance is nice, the service was ok but I wasn’t impressed with the food at all. I had an early reservation actually the first to be seated however the food wasn’t piping hot and didn’t taste freshly made. The prices are decent and the serving size fit the price. The plantains were too hard, the elote was just ok, the coconut shrimp were piping hot however just didn’t taste fresh or have the Caribbean vibe to it. The beans and rice were not a favorite at all and the tacos were merely ok. I’ve heard great reviews abut this restaurant however I didn’t have a grand food experience. The lemonade was GREAT! Read more We were a party of 5 including a 3 year old. We made a reservation for brunch, but then thought it might be better for the little girl if we did takeout - and then changed our minds and decided to stay. Although we may have been driving the staff crazy, they all kept their good humor and were gracious and accommodating. The rum cocktails were delicious, as was the food - among other things, the crab cakes and the omelet were outstanding. Read more Oh wow such a great experience. The food was amazing. Everything was good! I would highly recommend everything. The atmosphere was great.  Mother/Daughter outing before a play this was the first time for my good friend and her mom.

Our host was great and very personable, Brian.     Everyone wanted to come back try something different. Read more A friend and I decided to dine in for happy hr. It was her first time and we set at the bar to get a better view of everything. Service was slow but it was not busy but once we ordered everything far as food and drinks looked and tasted great. The server "" Jah"" could be a lil more friendly but other then that our overall experience was 9/10 Read more This was my first time trying this place for brunch with a few friends on Sunday, Sept. 8, 2024. The brunch menu has a small selection more of breakfast-type food. Overall, the food was great, but the customer service we received was not so great. Our waitress came to take our order literally 5 minutes before brunch closed out. Mind you, our reservation was at 1:45, but we didn't get any services until 2:25, and the brunch menu/selection ended at 2:30. Once we received our food, she never came to check on us, never offered us more water, we had to ask for silverware, and it took almost 30 minutes to get a drink from the bar that we ordered through the waitress. The atomshepre was great. The place is kind of small, but I will say the food was delicious and the prices were great. Will I go back again? Definitely not. Customer service is one of my biggest things when dining out. None of the ladies had a great time due to the bad customer service we received. The lady seemed to not be having a good day that day.

Can’t wait to visit again. Read more Overall it was a great experience. Drinks were good and strong. Food was flavorful. The waitress was monotone, lackluster and service was slow. The place gets packed, yet the music was at a good volume and the overall environment was quiet. One of the people at our table ordered the red snapper and said it was subpar. Jerk chicken, the sides, the Jerk salmon and rasta pasta were all great!!! I would return with hopes of better service. Read more Read more 14 Parish never disappoints.

Definitely one of my favorites! Read more Great time, was able to receive relatively quick service, food was amazing, drinks were great.  The ambiance was great,  good music,  adult atmosphere.  Great servers and recommendations on drinks  Wonderful experience!  Food was not good for the price. My waiter was attentive and the drinks strong and good. They really could do better with the red snapper it was horrible  First time here. Definitely need reservations in advance. The service was very quick. We received our drinks, appetizers & main dish all at the same time. We were told we only had 90 minutes to stay. It was more than enough time tho.
The food portions were large. My husband had the red snapper which came with a spicy rice side & cabbage. He loved it and enjoyed everything. I had the rib tip and biscuits. It didn’t look that great BUT the meat was so delicious and tender. The biscuits were soft & tasty. There were 4 biscuits which were too many for me. I would have preferred 2 biscuits & a veggie.

I guess if one is a vegan then maybe it is acceptable due to food restrictions.  Food usually much tastier.  Still recommend the restaurant. Read more I love this place and abundance of healthy and delicious dishes.  However, not sure why non-service animals are allowed to dine in the indoor dining area.  Amazing server John took great care of our table   The food is consistently fresh and sourced selectively. The butternut soup was delectable And the meat loaf entree and spaghetti squash delicious and so light
Upbeat atmosphere & always a pleasure Read more Server was prompt and very accommodating.  Food is excellent and well presented.  The seared tuna on rice/quinoa vegetables was very tasty.  The meatloaf is superb, but might benefit from more fingerling potatoes.  The pot roast sandwich was delicious.  We have been to other locations and hope to dine at TFK frequently. Read more Our reservation was for two people. One entree was excellent (the Mediterranean Wrap), but the other (the Ancient Grain Bowl) was just mediocre. We had a previous experience at this restaurant where all of the food (artisinal pizza) was excellent, so we would still return. Our server was wonderful and the ambience is enjoyable. Read more Good food and pleasant place for brunch! We enjoyed it!  Aw I am so bummed. My husband and I have been here many times and we were SO impressed the last few times with the quality of food. Today we were let down. We went specifically for this steak/black rice/tomato dish and found out it’s gone, must have been seasonal. Everything on the menu now seems to be mushroom heavy. The quality didn’t seem as high today, my beef was rough. Also leaving the bathrooms the kitchen floor was a mess. We will probably wait until that steak dish comes back next season to try it again Read more First time visiting and we found the food very tasty and service was good. Food arrived quickly and was cooked perfectly.  Prices are in line with expectations now. Great experience!  Delicious healthy menu.

Unfortunately, last night, the truth, food kitchen on Erie Street in Chicago did not meet our expectations     I love their turkey burger, but last night the turkey burger was dry and even the bun seemed old or dried out     Definitely not up to true food standards Read more Great, healthy food! Highly recommend! Also great service.  We ate here the day before and everything was fine. This time we got a waiter who was probably forced to work over a holiday weekend and was terrible. Do not eat here over holiday weekend. Read more We ate here yesterday and it was excellent. Today the service was mediocre and the food was mediocre as well Probably because it was on a holiday. ￼ a patient not provide good service and food. They should not be open on a holiday. ￼ Read more Food and service were both outstanding. Guacamole as an appetizer was super good, as were our meals. Wait staff was very attentive, professional, and friendly. The atmosphere was great for both a professional and social setting. Read more Excellent food with a good variety of vegan choices.  I loved True Food Kitchen in Atlanta, and I thought I'd feel the same way about the location in Chicago.  I was disappointed to find that they are not quite the same.  Caveat is that it's been a couple of years... so perhaps things across the board have shifted and changed.  I thought everything was way overpriced.  They brought my kids gluten free pizzas out with a literal ""dash"" of cheese.  It was mostly sauce.  The sweet potatoes in my penang curry were hard as a rock.  I had high hopes because there wasn't a wait, the staff seemed kind, and I'm not new to the restaurant.  But $25 for a lunch bowl, Idk how organic it is, is not cool...especially if you're not going to get it right.  My hope is that perhaps this was just an off day.  My wallet is salty though, not going to lie... Read more Needed a restaurant to accommodate meat eaters and a vegan so we tried True Food Kitchen.
Everything, from service to food, was mid, nothing great, not awful. The hummus appetizer was good, and of the 3 entrees we ordered (spicy chicken sandwich, grass-fed steak, ancient grain bowl), the vegan bowl was the best. Read more My pizza was undercooked and when I asked if they could put it back in the oven they didn’t do so. Also, it took 30 minutes just to get our drinks.  They had plenty of space to seat our party of 12. The server was very kind and able to accommodate all our requests. We had a birthday celebration at the table, and she even went above and beyond to plate new small serving plates with fresh silverware. 

Food is great, and the ambience is perfect for date nights as well as big group parties. We went for a Saturday brunch. Read more Read more I wanted to take my dad somewhere so he would be in good spirits. True Food did just the trick. The appetizer of tuna lettuce wraps came out quickly and were tasty, my citrus tuna salad and my dad's trout were great. The prink line tart was a great end to the meal. Highly recommend. Read more In spite of the restaurant being empty, it still took 50 minutes to get our food.  Another 15 to get the bill.  5-10 to pay.  Service, 1 star.  4 people, $80.  A $20 burger.  Insane.  Value- 1 star.  Lukewarm lasagna that was also $20.  The taste was decent, but it didn’t look like a comfort food lasagna.   Burger was good according to my guest.  Teriyaki bowl for kid.  No flavor.  Uncooked veggies.  Huge miss.   Surprised given the yelp reviews. Read more We are regulars because the restaurant never disappoints. From the hostess, the server, to the manager, everyone is nice and professional. The food is delicious and so food for you.  Always excellent food.  Bowls were fantastic and I had my first mocktail, a slightly spicy margarita.  Really good. Our server was great but he had to help other tables and cover the bar so he had a lot on his ”plate” (PI). Read more The food service and ambience were all good. The only exception was that that place was too cold. We weren’t the only ones that thought so.  My shrimp and chicken were over cooked, the rest of our food was not what I have experienced in the past. Things were not seasoned like normal and our server was very direct and almost rude. Read more Great as always! We eat here every week. Tuscan Kale Salad, Ancient Grains bowl and Teriyaki Quinoa bowl are our favorites.  Wish they had more vegan brunch options, but the food we had and atmosphere were great!  Had brunch on Sunday and everything was delicious as always. This is one of the few restaurant chains that I truly enjoy going to. All the ingredients are fresh and healthy. We had the bison sausage pizza and a kale Caesar salad with salmon. Our server, Elma, was awesome! Read more I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere. Your server made me feel very welcomed.

Boneless wings were more like nuggets but tasty .  The place is really nice. The food was really good, especially the dragon boneless wings. The service was fast and good.  Great pizza, fair price and exceptional/friendly service.  Couldn’t taste even a hint of tequila in my margarita, and my date ordered the “weed jar” that tasted like plain iced tea. I saw another table send back 4 drinks because theirs were not strong enough as well. Our server/bartender recommended the dragon wings and told us that they aren’t hot/spicy but “Asian style” when I asked about the overall heat. I can usually handle some heat, but both me and my date’s mouths were on fire and in desperate need of water (which was non existent on our table lol)… if you like hot wings then these are for you, but if you don’t do well with them I’d stay away!

The Chicago fire was spicy but also tried a $25 dollar roll that was deep fried in eggs and it was terrible.

Nos gusto mucho el ambiente y lo cerca que esta de puntos de interés.  Our dinner was pre-concert so our server made a special effort to serve us promptly so we could make the show, which we very much appreciated. We sat on the exterior patio which was pleasant except for a loud DJ playing at an unrelated adjacent venue. The inside dining area was quieter, and has a modern decor with wide screen flat panel screens for program viewing (college football was on during our visit). Our meals were very tasty. I had the Duck 2-Ways and my partner had the Shrimp Ceviche. Our compliments to the back of the house! About the only downside is entry to Millennium Park, within which Millennium Hall is located, requires a security search so restaurant visibility by pass-by foot traffic seemed somewhat diminished. Still, it’s worth the effort to go through security. We have eaten at other venues along South Michigan Avenue and find Millennium Hall on par with many of those mid-scale restaurants and perhaps slightly more affordable. Overall it was an enjoyable experience. Read more Overall, this was and unimpressive meal. I had the whitefish which was recommended by the server. It was oversalted and overcooked. Although by dining companion enjoyed his cocktail, my cocktail experience was very disappointing. I ordered a standard martini which looked and tasted wrong. I confirmed it had been  made with sweet vermouth instead of dry mouth. The server said it was the only vermouth they had. She was accommodating and switched my order to a Manhattan. The restaurant is clearly understaffed. The server was also working behind the bar. She was friendly and did her best. We chose to sit inside due to the very loud music outside. Disappointing to find that the same music was paying loudly inside as well. The previous restaurant in that spot was excellent. This one was merely OK. Read more This is not a bad place to grab a quick meal. The service is fantastic. The food was good.  Service was just ok. The food came out quickly- the pasta dish was good, but the sirloin was meh. We asked for medium and it came out well done.  The mushroom pizza is the best thing I have eaten in Chicago. Delicious!!  Great restaurant in Millennium Park right under The Bean!  The food was excellent but the service was mediocre. The waiter seemed confused about basics of service that should have been common knowledge. Long wait for the check, which we only got when I finally flagged him down. Restaurant was not at all busy. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/65366833.webp

Today it was not so pleasant. There were landscape/outdoor workers with tractors, leaf blowers and other noisy machinery being used. Could that not be stopped during lunch hour? At times, we had to wait for the machinery to pass before resuming conversation.
I also felt bad for our server. It appeared she was the only server for the dining room, the bar dining and the larger roof top patio dining area.

Waiter was prompt and attentive. Food arrrived quickly. Relatively good quality entrees. Only issue was the waiter asked whether I wanted the change when I paid with cash.

I did not finish it.  So I paid $38 for GREEN BEANS.  Our first time at this restaurant with reservations for 6 celebrating my brother’s birthday. We were the first to check in with 4  guests following shortly. The bar tender directed us to the bar area to a table of 8 next to the bar . Refusing to sit there ,I requested seating in the other section. He claimed he had no waiter for that area..I refused his answer and stated it was a special birthday and wanted a more quiet space. Once seated we got menus and he disappeared- as other guests arrived he finally returned. Took drink orders and left. The service was slow, the menu looked appealing and what was said to be one of the best choices” the chicken pot pie” looked nothing like the photo online and tasted so odd that we asked what the ingredients were because it had an very odd taste- the gravy was watery and yellow-his answer” he didn’t know”… .that was it! My sister had to say finally she didn’t want it and asked for a hamburger. The food is average ! The server never offered a refill on our soft drinks or iced tea-never offered dessert. I had to tell him again it was my brother’s birthday and then a dessert came with 1 (one) spoon for this larger dessert and never asked if anyone else wanted something. Three times my sister asked for a spoon. The reply from the waitress was “ the is my first day” and I’ve had no training, nor did she know where the spoons were!! For a location so close to a Hotel in Schaumburg, you would think their waiters would improve the skills they should have been trained for! We’ll not be returning!

Joseph was an attentive server and as usual the food was delicious.  Everyone thought the food was very good. Three of us had the Pasta special and the value was great. The wait-person was a very nice person. He was pretty attentive and accommodating, but when it came to bringing the food out that was another story. You would think you would get your salad before the main meal but that didn't happen. There were eight of us and it probably took ten minutes before all the food was brought out.

Based on reviews we found, we ordered the nachos and a couple of Thai lettuce wraps.  Both were HUGE portions, well worth the reasonable prices charged, and were more than adequate as full meals for all of us.

Both dishes were excellent.  We would certainly order again.  We also ordered two rounds of specialty cocktails, and all were made very well using top shelf liquor.  Prices were moderate for what was used, $10-$12 each. (Unfortunately, this made our bill for drinks greater than our food bill, but that happens often! ;-p)

Because the restaurant area was closed, the reservation check-in process was not dealt with normally, but the manager came to our table to take information and ensure we would receive proper credit and OT points for our reservation.  And he offered free warmed-up cookies for dessert as well!

If you're going to offer it, and charge that much, do it well. Or don't do it at all. That's all I ask. Read more Read more We were seated right away when we arrived. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was great. I had the prime rib which was very good and cooked as asked for and my wife had the filet which was very good and will be lunch tomorrow. Dessert was very tasty. Not our first visit and we will be back. Read more I love Jamesons.  Great food ambience and the service is terrific.  We were two couples, a party of four seniors having dinner before a show at the adjacent Northlight Theater.  The waiter was friendly and efficient. We started with Manhattan Clam Chowder which was a little spicy for our taste but overall very good.  Dinner orders included chicken sandwich, filet Migon sliders, skirt steak sandwich and salmon. We were all pleased with the preparation and presentation of our choices.  Portions of food and desserts were generous.  Prices of our dinners were in the $20-30 range per person plus tax and tip. We recommend Jameson’s for a very good meal at a fair price. Read more Party of 6 with 5:45 reservations prior to 7:30 Theater tickets. Plenty of time. Server inquired regarding theater. Salads were served. Entrees didn’t come out until after 7:00, after asking many times. Blamed kitchen. Hate to be rushed through a meal.

Junior was our server this past week.
He was kind, helpful and friendly.
We ordered the chopped salad with grilled shrimp and the halibut special.  Both entrees were excellent.  The warm bread they serve at the beginning of each meal is delicious!
I took my family of ten for my daughter’s birthday dinner there and it was excellent.
We love and can depend on this Jameson location for a wonderful experience! Read more The wait staff could be more personable.      We ordered a steak medium-well, and it came to the table, medium-rare; but, it did taste OK.  The baked potato was very dry.

I asked the hostess several times how long of a wait there would be. Finally after waiting more than 45min the manager Eddie came up to us and apologized for the wait. He then went above and beyond to make it a great experience. He took us to a table and took our order himself and told us he would make sure we got our food quickly.

They took my mobile phone number to text me when my table would be ready.  45 minutes later I went to the host stand and they saw me approaching and immediately seated me.

Had to wear coats because air-conditioning was too cold.  First and foremost, the young man waiting on all of us was wonderful. He was kind, polite and gave service with a smile.

I will say, that the floors were sticky including the bathroom. The bathrooms (women’s) was dirty and no toilet paper!!     told the manager who seemed to be put off and unapologetic.

As for the food; the burgers we ordered were greasy and the fries were burnt,soggy and cold. Read more Read more Live music too loud for dinner. Good for a bar though if you are not trying to eat or talk with the person next to you.  Our 1st time here. It was a Saturday night so it was very busy and loud.

Love the toasted pork belly and cheese sammich and tomato soup for dipping. One comment is that I love the music at lunch. It's classic rock mostly, right up my alley, and not played so loud you can't talk to the people at your table. For dinner, my wife and I are hesitant, because depending on who is controlling the music, it can be very loud and very annoying and repetitive music.

Air conditioning was not working in that section.

For such a large place- we should never have been seated in that area. Read more I would recommend Hackney's on Lake if you'd like a great traditional Chicago-area local dining experience. I have been to Hackney's probably a half dozen times over many years in Chicago and the Chicago area. They have wonderful burgers and their own fresh made bread is quite simply amazing and unique for a family owned restaurant and a local favorite.

Yesterday, and last year, when I visited Hackney's in the mid evening I found them to be expectedly busy. I know that some might take issues with how this impacts wait staff and service time (It was longer than I expected and by listening to customers seated nearby was intolerable to them) but the service is attentive when the staff is around and friendly. I am more than willing to give them a pass on some of the wait times. 

Hackney's has been around a long time and has gone through some changes (namely the loss of several locations) over the last dozen or so years, but I believe that has been in the interest of keeping their business going. And the food is quite simply worth it. Their menu, while to me seems slightly smaller than in the past, offers a wide range of American dinner standards. Let's be honest, most people are coming here for the burgers and crispy fried onions. Both of those did NOT disappoint. The new smashburger (give yourself credit Hackney's!  update your website like your social media---it's not on the online menus nor your print one!) I only knew it existed following their social media--it was a great take on a recently-viral sensation. More people should be trying this!  

Hackney's while in the moderate-to-high price range for casual dining, has an ambience (go there a few times, eat in their historic building AND their patio!  also check out their Harms location down the street), has great food and a great local history. I'll be going back, hopefully at least once or twice a year. Read more It was delightful to sit outside when the weather was perfect and the food was the Hackney's normal food that is loved by our community.  Great  cheeseburgers. Have lots salads. I got the BLT sandwich. It was great.  Waitress was in a hurry.  Just barely sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink or order apps.  Didn't give us a chance to evem glance at menu.  Got our apps and ordered dinner.  Dinner arrived and I was looking forward to the Hackney burger and as I began to eat the burger was completely cold.  My husband's fish was oily and barely tasted like fish.  Our waitress had apparently clocked out and we asked to speak to a manager.   A manager came out and was very apologetic.   We ordered different meals and it took a long time to receive them.  Manager came over and we were not pleased and he very graciously said don't worry the meal is on us.

Celebrated a birthday and had a great time 🥳  The meal was good, service good and pleasant( I will return here in the future’  Our server was attentive, timely in checking in, and positive attitude.

We told him no about the wine club membership and that we had been there one time before.  He said he would return with water and walked away.  He could have asked us what we wanted to drink, told us about the wine club, but no, he dismissed us.  Upon returning, he set the water down and turned to walk away again, so my husband told him we would like to order drinks and dinner, rather than have to wait for him to return again.  He let us do that, but then quickly walked away without asking us about soup or salad…no opportunity for us to add either.  So, we had our entrees which were good, but much less in quantity than during our prior visit.  He did offer us a dessert menu and we shared one.  This waiter missed a larger order and tip because he was so brusque with us and did no upselling.  Quite frankly, we felt like 2nd class citizens because we didn’t answer that we were wine club members and honestly, we had no information offered about that.

See you soon Marco G!! Read more Have consistently had good meals. Kudos to our server who was covering bar, tables, and hostess with a positive attitude, and regular check-ins. Outstanding service!  Went here for a birthday brunch and the experience was really underwhelming and even disappointing. No one acknowledged or even said happy birthday to my son. The room we sat it was so noisy I couldn’t hear the person next to me. The server barely even checked on us the entire meal. The buffet was really not great either with several basic things not available (yogurt and oatmeal) and other items poorly prepared. My kids really wanted the French toast but it was squished flat overcooked and inedible. The corned beef was also tough and not edible. Honestly the only good items were the omelet and hashbrowns. Would not recommend especially for a family celebration since we couldn’t even enjoy the food or hear to talk with one another. Not sure why people say this Sunday brunch is good since I certainly didn’t feel is was worth  it. Read more Granite City is our go to restaurant. We are never disappointed with the food and service.  Loved the new spicy tropical salad.  Spinach artichoke dip was delicious.   I would have preferred all Naan instead of tortilla chips and naan.  Excellent service and great food.  Easy to find and good parking.  Our server Hunter was very nice and attentive.  Food was very good.  Loved the Chateau Ste. Michelle Chardonnay!  Drink options have improved!  Excited to come back.  Read more Service was good, but food arrived cold.  However, they remade it, and took it off the bill.  Food was fine otherwise.  The fish was much too greasy.  The fries and Cole slaw were good.  Very nice waitress. They noticed my open table note requesting a GF menu and automatically brought it.  I've recently been to the Schaumburg location and had a good experience. The Naperville location was a disappointment. The service was mediocre and the food was disappointing. Spinach & Artichoke Dip was mot good. Chips were stale. Sweet potato fries were good but cold. Grilled cheese with avocado sounded amazing but wasn't. The restaurant was empty so that should have been an indication.  I won't be returning. Read more Great food. Great waitress. Somewhat overpriced will go back  Host was friendly and engaging. Food was good. Waiter was not too friendly or attentive.  Server was rude. Didnt even get food i just got a beer and asked for check  Granite city is one of our favorite brunch places by far. A coworker recommended we go one Sunday and ever since we went with them we haven’t been disappointed. Food and drinks are always fresh and delicious. Prime rib is some of the best I’ve had. Also highly recommend the blueberry mimosas. The complimentary cinnamon rolls are also great. The staff also provided us a bottle of champagne in honor of our engagement we were celebrating. We’ll be back time and time again 👍 Read more Super beer! Appetizer’s were great!  Main meals were terrific. Loved chicken pot pie!  A great bargain due to the Friday $3 Flying Monkey special.  The onion soup is my favorite compared to other restaurants.  My favorite dish is the chicken pot pie.  I also hope they make their Burning Barn red ale a standard item.

It was a beautiful night to eat outside. Loved it!!  Our server wasn’t attentive. It took forever to get boxes for our food and for her to take our payment.

Good beer and food selection.
Problem was the “Famous Fish and Chips”. 4 out of the six in our group ordered it…undercooked, “soggy” with no texture; bland, tasteless, had to douse  with malted vinegar or tartar sauce at every bite or any condiment on the table just to give any taste. Two didn’t even bother finishing it.
Have been there before with excellent burgers, stew, etc.
Maybe it was just a bad kitchen day, but 4 out of 4 agreed it was a major disappointment due to the Fish and Chips. Read more Server was attentive, pleasant and very accommodating. We told her we had theater plans, so we didn’t want to linger. She made certain that happened.
Choices were many. Prices are the same as everywhere else.
My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they serve Pepsi products, not Coke products. I drank water! And their added surcharge. Lots of places that apply that, will take it off, if requested.

The first time they did not honor our reservation and turned us away.  There were 6 of us who do not live in AH and had come from as far as Huntley.  Couldn’t get in anywhere else in the downtown area on a Saturday night.
Today was ok, and I always give at least a 20% tip.  Not this time.  Our server at first was very nice, it did take quite a while for us to get our drinks…3 waters. The bar was right behind us.  Food came in decent time, it was just ok. The bad part was that we waited forever for our checks.  I had to get up and look for our server, but there were no employees anywhere.  The restaurant was not crowded at all, maybe 4 or 5 tables occupied inside.  Someone finally came in and I told her that we had been waiting quite a while for our checks.  Our server then appeared.  We had asked her about separate checks earlier and she said no problem but then gave us 1 check. She wasn’t very nice about my friend questioning her. We ended up just splitting the check.

Makes no sense to pay full price when the quality of meat has gone downhill and the salad bar is nothing like it used to be. I literally was just at Fogo a few years back and it was never this bad but now I know not to go back. Unfortunately it’s not cheap so it’s a big price to swallow.

After an hour I wondered why nothing had a sauce and asked and was told they had various sauces including BBQ and a horseradish cream sauce. Our multiple servers never told us. It was also chaotic.

Love the half priced pizza!  Don’t go later than 5:00. Especially on 1/2 price pizza night, our server was great but as the night went on we saw less and less of him. He was spread all over the restaurant.  We were a party of seven to celebrate my birthday and we were sitting right by the front door and you could not miss our table. No one came up to our table right away and offered us water or anything to drink. I believe it was maybe 10 minutes later after we sat down maybe a little longer that the waiter said oh I'll be with you shortly. Very disappointing! Finally came around that's what we wanted to drink finally brought the drinks after a while. Then he took our order. Food came out pretty good. One of my friends said that her hamburger sliders were not hot at all or her potatoes. Otherwise I think it was okay. He barely came to check on us an hour and a half dinner or whatever it was. I don't know how my friends tipped him but personally I would not have tipped him very much. Was not attentive.

Food server was absolutely horrible! She didn’t pay attention when we ordered and we had to ask another server to get us more drinks because she was either no we’re to be found or flat out ignored us when she walked by!

We had the chicken Parm sandwich, Jambalaya, and bratwurst with sauerkraut. All were very good. And our server Edgar was excellent. Friendly and efficient.  Everything was good -consistently good food. Thanks!  Anything on the menu is worth it. A party of 7 and everyone enjoyed their meals. No pizza this time but have gotten it in the past and it's a good tasting, thin pizza with a crispy crust.  I’ve been to not only this Moretti’s but several other ones.

They had a special for the Bears game on wings. We ordered the Parmesan garlic sauce. It really wasn’t a sauce. It was some watered down concoction that literally seemed thinner than water. It didn’t stick to the wings at all. It made some soggy as they sat on the plate and was borderline disgusting. I have better Parmesan garlic sauce in my fridge that’s from the grocery store.

Secondly, please invest some money back into the business. Your TVs are not even as good as a 55” 4k that I bought on Amazon for $250.

Several people who came in who sat at the bar left quickly. Probably went somewhere else to watch. Gee wonder why. Read more While the food is good, especially on a special night like 1/2 price pizza, the service is a little slow even though it was busy, but not packed.

Long wait to be greeted at our table and long wait to get our check - both of which are a bit unusual for Chandler's.  It did not seem super busy the night we went, so IDK why it was so slow.
On a positive note, the burgers are delicious. Read more Delicious food! Prices very reasonable compared to other places  Food was amazing! You get a lot of  food for the money.  The food was excellent. Our table had the Salmon, Prime Rib, Chicken and Pork Schnitzel.  Kitchen seemed to be putting out food at a pretty slow pace. Maybe that’s how it goes at restaurants that are attached to golf courses? Excellent fish fry. Decent portions for price. One of few restaurants around that serves bread with meal.

Outside is great, with not having other buildings nearby.  Jill took excellent care of us on the patio. We enjoyed the views.  There were four of us out for dinner.  We loved the food and the service.  The portions are big and the food is excellent.  Great value !  The restaurant is on the golf course.  Wonderful experience. Food was absolutely delicious, and prices not out of line. We will be back!  The team was accommodating to our growing group.  Added tables as needed and our server remained calm while we added more people and moved around at the table.  Did separate checks with out batting an eye.  We were so pleased with our service. Read more Read more The service was subpar last night. We waited 30 min for our server to come take our order. She never returned after other staff dropped off our meals.
Once I flagged down the host, I was able to get the check. That was left on the table for 10 min when I flagged down another server to run i.

Our drinks came out after our meal was complete and the check was dropped. If you are weeded as a server, you ask for help. Awful service experience. Read more Great food and service. The Prime Rib was excellent.  The food was so good and the service was exceptional. We just moved to the area and this will be a regular place for us to eat.  Like to frequent here it’s usually a solid dinner.  This time was a bit different since everyone was in one area so noise level and space between tables weren’t as expected.  Service was a little slow in the close out of our ticket.  I had a carry out order which came to us but had to ask for the check and then waiting for the itemized one. About 20 minutes of time went by so I am sure the carry out was cold by the time I brought it to the person. Read more Nice summer evening sitting outside overlooking the golf course, very nice.

Potatoe pancakes that we chose were served with applesauce and sour cream.  Special dinners are also a very good value! Read more We had a beautiful evening. Service was great I love when you have staff all working together.  The daily specials are the always very good.
Wednesday night is Hamburgers, good deal and very good burgers.  The broasted chicken was wonderful, served hot and juicy. I highly recommend this dish.  They always seem to overload their servers!  They always appear to be running all over the place.  We’ve never had bad service but it’s clear that they are overwhelmed every time we eat there.  We were just there and our server hardly was able to come check on us and yet we saw 3 servers leaving.  They should’ve kept at least 2 there to help until it slowed down.  I’m a server.   I can see what they are going through.  It’s not fun! They are running around like crazy.  Some people may not understand what’s going on and the poor servers tips get effected.  Not fair to them at all. Read more Great food and service.
Service has seemed to improve - staff was always good but clearly overworked the last few years.  Enjoyed a beautiful evening on the patio. Was not too crowded and had great service.  Elaine did a great job of keeping us happy!

There were 15 of us and they did a great job at accomidaying us.  First time eating at Lou Malnati's Pizza in Schaumburg as we were visiting from out of state.  Great food, great experience, and our son asked if we could eat there again.  Medium deep dish pizza with appetizer satisfied 3 adults.  We made a free reservation to ensure a spot on a Thursday night but it was not needed, but may be needed on weekends.

Family has always been at the center of Paisans’ beginning and the driving force behind its success. Paisans Pizza was started by Luigi, an immigrant to the United States, in 1985. In a small corner store in Cicero, Illinois, Luigi started making pizzas out of a household kitchen oven. Shortly after, Luigi was joined by his son Pete, fulfilling orders one at a time using hand-written tickets hanging from clothespins in their tiny kitchen.

Pete spent the next 30 years expanding the business, while also refining the Paisans brand and menu. He did this while always remembering what got us here: our famous pizza and award-winning wings.

Staying true to the idea of family, Pete brought in his boys to help him take the Paisans concept to the next level. Mentoring his sons in their new roles, Pete involves them in every aspect of the restaurant business.","Read more First time here and we will be back.

The Açaí and Yogurt parfait appetizer was excellent, offering a great mix of crunch, sweetness, and savory flavors with plenty of granola.

However, the Somerset breakfast entrée was disappointing. While the bacon was great, the eggs and potatoes lacked seasoning and were bland. The Brioche French Toast also lacked spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, failing to satisfy my sweet tooth. Given the bill, the food didn’t meet my expectations.

In fact, Schnitzel Platz will often feature a special menu that has items only available throughout select times of the year like Oktoberfest. There are, of course, plenty of consistent favorites you will find too.

Some consistent menu items include the Kaiser in the neighborhood, whole suckling pig, Deutsche Haus platte, schweine braten and the sauerbraten. Make sure you also try the many schnitzels, of course, like the pork schnitzel, weiner schnitzel or the jager schnitzel.

If you like ear-splitting accordion music, waiting for mediocre food, and paying too much, this place is for you.  We have recently been eating German food and wanted to try one closer to home.

Great food and service and a fun German band.  We all had a form of schnitzel and spätzle - fantastic  I didn’t think it necessary to reserve a seat for a babywho does not eat restaurant food. The restaurant was not full with many empty seats but we were denied seating because of the need of a highchair. It was 5:15 pm. The staff informed us we that they could not accommodate us after they seated us. They disappeared for 10 minutes leaving us wondering if they would make an accommodation as the table was not filled. I think they expected us to leave the baby somewhere else while we had dinner. They could have suggested we move to the outdoor tent that required no reservations. We have been customers since it opened and have never expected this lack of courtesy. Not one manager or owner came to speak with us just a waitress who was unhelpful. Read more Wine and Bier were great! Our Server was very nice. Food not bad, not great.  Great place for big group.  October feast!! at the Platz is the best !!

We had reservations, were seated promptly in a great booth.

Fun crowd, traditional music and crowd participation.  So much fun.

Emily served us and she did an exceptional job. Beer , appetizers , main course and desserts were all brought in a well timed and professional manner.

She’s a good sport and had fun with our friends.

Deserves special recognition.

Quality food . I had the schwienbraten— perfect. Tender , roasted flavor and the cracklings were a treat.  Our group also had the pork schnitzel and the Octoberfest plater. All were served at a proper temperature and were delicious.

Considering the number of patrons and the size of the event the Platz continued to be on its best game!

We like the outdoor seating and the past food quality.

However, this was a bad experience as all of our food order did not come at the same time and thus most in our group had finished before the last person received their order.  And that person was a child.  Many other restaurants frequently try to get children's orders out early or at least with all the adults.
Other food items were only warm and not hot.  An order of fries was very soft, not crisp. Read more Great food and drinks. Super attentive staff for our large group.  I’ve never been here before and was looking forward to sitting on the patio. When I left I realized that the chair was so filthy my green pants were now streaked with black.

Some things were a little bland  The food was excellent but the portion size on the salmon was too small. Service was rather slow for the level of patrons in the dining room.  Very slow and erratic attention from servers. Food was OK but surely not a great value.   It initially took a while to get served, but once we had a waiter take our drinks order, service was great. The food was good, was served hot, and was plentiful. Our only complaint is it was just too noisy for these old ears. It was hard to hear other people at the table.

Good casual place - nice menu, big variety of drinks.  

Kid friendly.  But very loud.  The food and service were GREAT!!!  It was a louder environment than I'm used to, but I could hear my friends just fine.

The ambiance is very cool but the food is not good.  It's sub-par bar food. We had a large party and I got to try many dishes, all of them were simply ok. At no point did I say ""wow, this is really good."" They overcook the burgers, the steak sandwich was tough, the pasta was tasteless.

Then after we were seated people were being sat outside. It took 45 minutes for someone to come take our order. I had to go ask for service while others were being helped and served. The food was the only good thing and it took an hour and a half for it to come . Read more We made a dinner reservation 7:30.  Recess is a very cool place.  Decor is unusual and fun - yard games,etc.  During our Saturday evening visit, Recess seemed more of a group drinking hangout spot than a restaurant.
It took awhile to get our drinks.  Even longer to place our dinner order - sliders and a pizza.  The sliders were delivered to the table quickly.  They were good.  After more 30 minutes our server said he had checked on our pizza - something broke in the kitchen, but it was repaired.  Our pizza should be out soon.  Pizza never arrived.
At 9:30 we gave up.  Went to Pizza Friendly Pizza (yum).
We saw our server talking to the Manager about the situation, but she did not get involved until we called her over.

Honestly love bringing friends and people out of town here. It’s such a vibe  Second time there.  Second time the service was abysmal.  Food is ok.  But, they have zero clue what they are doing.  Might be better if they had a smaller space, but it's very apparent they are highly mis-managed.  And, when you get that...then you start looking at all the additional fees they charge for using a credit card to everything else.

Rather over priced as well. Read more Food was bad. Service was fine. Here for trivia night which only happens inside.

Our favorite was playing uno with giant cards. Lol  The food is honestly awful. If this place was not this pretty w such nice views, I don’t think it would exist.

Good beer and OK food. But you can't beat sitting outside on a lovely day. If you are in the West loop it's a good place to hang out.  Overall great experience hosting a surprise meet up for a friend's birthday. Staff responded to my questions quickly with a phone call back after I made the reservation. Host staff helped keep the meet up a surprise when the birthday person arrived. The patio is really nice - not too loud and very large. They also have free games you can play which is fun. Drinks were tasty but a little on the expensive side with all cocktails $15+ each and shots $10 each.

Took a star off because we were told they charge $5/person for outside cakes. If we had brought our cake, this fee would have cost more than the cake itself which is pretty ridiculous. We had cake elsewhere but enjoyed our time here. Read more The hostess seemed a bit rude, and wanted to seat us in a 4 person table (even that is small for 4 people), when there were 5 of us. And then she seemed annoyed abt that eventhough there were plenty of empty table.

Our drinks were delicious
Appetizers were the worst I have ever had
Melted Philly steak pull apart was chunks of dry french bread with unmelted and still cool shredded mozzarella and some sauce that smelled like feet.
The tater tots were dumped in a pool of watery cheese sauce and a soggy mess.
Chicken Parmesan was tiny over breaded, over cooked, chicken on a huge piece of bread. Sauce was disgusting.
Lava cake was fine

It’s definitely a place you go to take pictures and that’s it. Read more Awful service took so long for drinks food and even water.  Nice place and good service. Food was pretty mid for price.  The drinks were good but the food was just ok. Pretty presentation but flavor was eh.  The absolute worst service I have ever received in my life. The food is okay but I wouldn’t return  A group of 4 of us recently went back to Tabu (I've been there several times) for one of our birthday dinners. The restaurant is beautiful - very spacious, great colors and lighting, plants scattered everywhere, and has the most number of private bathroom stalls I've ever seen in one bar (in the basement with minimal lighting - feels pretty creepy but hey, when you gotta go you gotta go). 

The food is excellent - the salsa trio is one of the most delicious I've had, the tacos are incredible and even the quintessential burger on the menu is fantastic.

The reason for the 2 star is the service is always terrible and EXTREMELY slow. We have been here several times and each time we spend 2+ hours at the table purely because of the wait. When we were seated our waiter came over to take our drink order and was never seen again until 30 minutes later when he delivered the drinks and took our food order. This was confusing since the restaurant was about 30-40% full. We eventually got our food but were afraid to order more drinks because we didn't want to wait another half hour. We had to wait even longer to get the check when we were done. All that notwithstanding, the host who initially seated us was unfriendly and didn't talk to us at all, and the other staff cleared our plates and silverware so fast when we weren't finished that I had to eat the rest of my taco with another person's knife, because there was no way I was going to be able to flag anyone down to request more silverware.

Another odd thing that happened was a woman came over and took our photo which we assumed was a promotional picture - she returned with the pictures framed and handed them to all of us and waited at the table, I assume expecting us to ask to purchase them. When we handed them back she left without a word-very weird experience

Summary: pretty ambiance, tasty food but service is ROUGH. Only go here if you're in no rush at all and want to spend hours waiting for someone to take your order. Read more We went to Brunch. The food was very tasty, and each dish was a pleasant surprise. I definitely will get back to try dinner sometime.  Read more Although we were so excited to finally try this restaurant which we've been hearing about and wanting to, it was a disappointment. 
It is very nice atmosphere, and decor but that's as great experience goes. We had a rather early reservation for 3, table next to us was a party of at least 10 and got seated at the same time yet somehow they got service, drinks and food way before us who waited quite a while. 
We had browse the menu and were eager to try their Octopus dish only to be told ""they ran out of octopus""! I mean it was about 7:30pm, only about 4 tables had people and doubt everyone that was there ordered the octopus 🙄... And how do you not stock up on weekends too though? 
Secondly besides at the beginning, our waitress took a while to serve us. Dishes were not all that, nachos were not nachos nor close to what waitress described... Had so much cheese it overpowered anything else on them and this is coming from someone who loves cheese. Drinks were ok. Music was not in tune with the ambiance of the restaurant and almost tired us up. 
Overall, felt like it is over hyped for what it really is or perhaps just went on an off day.  The best part of this experience was the decor, but could've had better food and service somewhere else.

On a nice day, it's a perfect walk from the Green line. Read more Absolutely great experience! Our server Mike was the best and helped make our experience that much better.  The food at Tabu is really good, which is why this was our second visit. This time, however, the service was horrible and the restaurant did not open until 11:10am, even though we had an 11am reservation (which requires a card and will charge you). They then said they could not seat us for 30 mins and directed us to the bar. We were ultimately seated at a different type of table than we requested and the food was great.

Loved the energy and the vibe and our server Amanda was wonderful she was very attentive and so nice. Great service.  Everything was great !! Can’t wait to go back 
Good times  Best best best place to go for a couple drinks watch the game and listen to music.  Music was WAY too loud, could not hear the person next to you. We left after half a drink and went elsewhere.  Didn’t honor our reservation. Received an email saying they couldn’t/wouldn’t honor our reservation  Service would not let us order something that is on the brunch menu that I had ordered for my birthday a week prior. Wanted to charge us double then gave us attitude and bad service the whole experience for questioning why. When a manager said they’d comp it we said we will pay for what we ordered we just didn’t understand why they were saying we couldn’t order it until 2pm when it was on the brunch menu that says 11-2pm. Read more Louie made our night! His kindness and generosity made my birthday INCREDIBLE! Not to mention the servers were lovely as well. Definitely my favorite place to come to when I need a night out with a lil drink. Read more I love PB&J. It’s a great place to watch a game. However, when there is a DJ for game night, the noise level is far too loud. You can’t talk to the person next to you at all.  Insanely loud for 6:30pm, couldn't hear our group talk  Please update online brunch menu. We choose this place because of the menu but once there the menu was different than what we saw online.  Read more It was okay. Food was okay. Order wasn’t correct. Beer tasted stale.  Was a complete disaster when it came to service I honestly don’t even know who our server was , one guy was extremely rude and just kept pushing high noons so he didn’t actually have to work  love any opportunity to stop by PB&J for Iowa football! one of the few chill spots in the west loop that we can always rely on!  Always my fav bar in the West loop. And can't beat an awesome bar that allows pups!  Took 30 minutes to get a server to our table and another 20 minutes for us to get our drink order. Not a good experience  Fantastic thanksgiving dinner, even my child ate the turkey. My picky husband had no complaints about the food. The music was a little loud but we had a blast. I definitely recommend to others!  Great place to meet up with friends/family for pizza and drinks. Nice atmosphere. Definitely will go back when I’m in Chicago again.  Incredible food and great vibe , there’s also two other establishments on site that are must sees. The piano bar Grapes and Grains and the new Reading Room.  Was not expecting a Halloween party.  Way too much and way too loud  Very dog friendly! Loved the energy of this place!  Read more Our server was very attentive and food was great! It’s a little pricey but worth it. It’s a very loud and energetic environment if you like that!  They never came back for me to order food. Then when I ate some of my friends food they took it away before I could finish it. Annoyed.  loved coming for the iowa game! was super impressed by the food as well!  feedback was it's ""ok"" only.  Had very high expectations but alas :(  Amazing experience. The staff were so excited and friendly for the dog foam party event. They even remember that it was our dog’s birthday!  Great food and drinks. Loved the laid back atmosphere  I hosted a company happy hour at PB&J and they were the easiest and friendliest to plan with! I would definitely host it there again!  Great time with a group of friends. Friendly staff and good vibes all around.  Excellent food and service! Absolute 10/10. They staff even brought us drinks because we were celebrating my friend’s bachelorette. What a class act! Loved the whole atmosphere!  Food was very good . Brought my fam and they loved it",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/32687677.webp

This is the second venture by the guys who brought you Paddy Long's Beer & Bacon Pub in Lakeview.","Read more Sat on the patio before a concert at the United center. They have a shuttle that takes you from the restaurant to the venue. Spicy margarita was great and the fries were amazing.  Both service, beer and food were great. Would definitely go again.  Not enough staff. Waitress took our order for 2 beers at our table - and after more than 30 mins, nothing had arrived and no wait staff in sight. We left.  We made a reservation for an early dinner. On arrival, they asked if we wanted inside or outside. I said inside. They said, actually we can only seat you outside. Okay. Then we’re seated underneath a dripping section of the roof. I asked to be re-seated. They told me there were no other options. Both inside and outside were 60% empty! And as dinner went on, the outside patio remained mostly empty.

Food was fine. Service left a lot to be desired. Read more I love this place!  Food is great and staff very upbeat and helpful.  We enjoyed our time prior to attending a show.  Loved Bacon the cat. Food was good and it was a fun atmosphere.  Great drinks-good beer and cocktails. 2 adults, 2 teens and everyone found something delicious to eat. Played bags after. Outdoor patio was great. Cute cat hanging out was a fun surprise. Good place to go before a concert/event at United Center. There is a shuttle for some events, but we just walked. Read more Food was amazing, service was fantastic, but large group nearby was excessively loud and lessened our dining experience. Was hopeful for more games to play as well.  Our server was great- while it wasn't crazy crowded, there also was not a lot of staff on hand, so it was obvious she was hustling the whole time. Food was fine- typical bar food.  I guess with the name and biergarten aspect, I was expecting a more German flair, but it was really mostly just American bar food with a Germanic touch here and there.  Maybe I just had incorrect expectations here.  It was annoying that at 5:30 on a Saturday, they wouldn't seat us outside in spite of several open tables and we had a reservation.  Not the end of the world, but that would have gone a long way. Great vibe though, easy street parking, and extensive drink menu with reasonable prices (esp for the city)  If I lived nearby, I'd definitely go back. Read more Kaiser Tiger is the perfect weekend hang out spot! The back patio is a true vibe with partially shaded areas and comfortable picnic tables. Service is attentive and friendly. The food is delicious and the beer selection is awesome! I love that Kaiser Tiger offers 5oz pours for most beers. I will definitely be coming back to Kaiser Tiger! Read more Read more Super fun beer garden.  We just had beers and brats and schnitzel in a sweet covered patio, but they also offer transport to the united center for events-so win win.  Great food, service and nice atmosphere for a casual lunch  Such a fun spot to hang out and grab a few beers! The beer garden is such a fun vibe and the food was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend getting a pretzel and the fries with all the different dipping sauces. Read more They couldn’t put the tv on for us even though I requested In my reservation notes / asked twice once there. The outside tv is only used for displaying the menu …nothing else. Did not have a waiter or waitress approach us so we left, wouldn’t recommend unless it’s really late at night! Read more Trendy yet casual spot close to the UC and Bottom Lounge. No problem getting in and street parking was readily available. We had the bacon app and various sausage sandwiches. Everything was very tasty. Read more I love this spot!  Great food, service, moderate pricing and easy parking!  All good!  Found it for the Olivia Rodrigo concert to be close to the stadium and their shuttle service. We were seated immediately and ordered a few minutes after being seated food was way bigger than I thought. I did order two drinks and first drink was good, second not so much. Don’t know if I would return again but glad I got to experience it Read more No menus is annoying. It’s a restaurant. Print some menus. Service was poor and unenthusiastic, I’ve had more exciting order takers at drive throughs. Pretzel app was ok, bacon board was ok. Fries were extremely salty and overpriced. Mains were literally cold. To their credit, they took two mains off the bill for being served refrigerator cold. Would not recommend. Basic changes would easily improve this restaurant. Read more Went for a quick bite before the Bulls’ game! Perfect casual dinner before the game. Great service & excellent food! Highly recommend the cheese board!  service was great, quality was all great, would like a few more basic options on the menu. music was a little loud and a little too much of one niche part of late 90's pop rock. a little bit pricey but understandable considering it's a pre-event venue. good experience Read more Read more Server took forever. Couldn’t spilt the check. Had to ask for boxes multiple times.  The bartender, I think his name is Jimmy, was fantastic.  The food tho is just blah.  Great spot and service. Shuttle to the minutes center was very convenient.  A bit pricey for a sandwich that was ok, good beers, good service but kinda dingy  Booked a brunch reservation because we wanted to check out the curling. Pleasantly surprised by the brunch and cocktails. Would suggest you check them out.  Food was good, took a while to come out. Service could have definitely been better- never got refills for our beer / pop once our food came out.  Perfect place for dinner and drinks before our Blackhawks game.  The restaurant is very big, lots of separate rooms.  We were seated at a large shared table right away.  Their house microbrew draft beer was great.  We tried two of their sausage sandwiches - bratwurst and andouille.  Both were excellent, and huge - very big portions.  Fries came with side of garlic sauce for dipping.

The shuttle to the game worked out perfect.  It is a van that seats about 15 people.  We took it over about 30 minutes before the game.  After the game we missed the first shuttle, then waited about 10 minutes for it to return.  Luckily it stopped right in front of us so we were able to get right on.  On busy nights you may have to wait multiple rounds.

Would definitely visit again. Read more I love when a server makes you feel Unwelcome. It was like we bothered him by spending money at their restaurant. Try being helpful. Try clearing a plate, when some is done. Don't mess up the order and blame the guests. be at least a little attentive. 
Food was fine, and I'm sure it would be better if service was better. He wrecked our meal and added 20% tip. I didn't get the chance to under tip, to prove a point. 
Probably never going back, that's a shame. Read more Yummy food, good drink, great vibes! Shuttle service to the bulls games was a great plus!  Fun place

Don’t forget to save room for dessert-the fresh baked Apple Pie with French vanilla ice cream and caramel is a favorite!","Read more Great place.  We love going here for dinner.  Always great service and excellent food.  Very poor service. We sat down and before we could even open the drink menu the server was asking what we wanted. The server wrote down the wrong order for one of us and when the meal came out she couldn’t identify which meal was what. When we showed her she expected us to eat the incorrect entree. We said okay and took the order away to get the correct entree. When it finally arrived the others had almost completed our meals. We came for a holiday meal and they ruined the celebration. We asked to speak to the manager and when he came over he said he would not charge for the one meal. That was nice but the damage was already done. Our server was not properly trained to be a server in a nice restaurant. The only times she came to the table was to take out order, deliver our meals and bring the check. We didn’t see her any other times. We thought Johnny’s was a quality restaurant. We’d been there before and enjoyed everything about the place. But we won’t be back anytime soon! This was a bad evening! Read more Johnny’s has joined the club of charging 3.5% for using a credit card. That should be disclosed upfront so I can decide to bring cash or go elsewhere.  I will not be going back.  Live music was fun! The food was ok, usually it’s a lot better!
Service wasn't the best, drinks were not refilled, only if we asked. It was bound to find our server.
Overall we had a nice time Read more We love dining at Johnny’s when we stay nearby. Such a warm and inviting atmosphere! Excellent food and so many choices. Staff is amazing!  Outstanding food, roasted chicken. Menu is awesome and service top notch. Best restaurant in Glenview!  The steak was fatty and tough.    Service was excellent.  Expected better quality on the steak.  This is one of our favorite go-to places, food is delicious, service is great!  The tartar type and cocktail type sauces were awful. My fish was overcooked and the salads and dressings were not good or fresh. Very disappointing  One of our favorite local places to dine! Highly recommend!  Read more First time diners. For the price they charge, not enough food given. 17.00 for a sandwich that was mediocre was way too much. Sorry we will not be coming back  We went to Sunday brunch and you could order from the menu or they had a small brunch menu. It was very good and the service was great too. They take reservations which I like.  As always we e noted the outdoor dining. The weather was perfect!  We hadn’t been there in a long time. My wife loved her food, I thought mine was ok. #iraeats  We found the service and the quality of the food to be excellent!  Their Caesar dressing is delicious, as was their French onion soup.

We loved it.  Hostess and waitress were very friendly and helpful.  We all enjoyed our meals and found them tasty with a nice presentation.  The seafood bisque was a tad bland.

The view of the skyline was gorgeous (especially being there at night), food was great (our favorite was the Mezze Board) & the staff was AMAZING - I can’t remember their names but they helped pull off a memorable surprise proposal so thank you for that 😊 Read more The restaurant was a fantastic place for a surprise party dinner. The staff was very accommodating and nice. The waitress was fantastic with handling a big table. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner, wether big or small group Read more We got there as soon as it opened. No wait time and food/drinks came out expeditiously. Service was bar none. Quality of the food/drinks was top tier.  The problem started at the hostess stand. We arrived early and the lady told us we could be seated right away. She asked us to step around the corner to be seated. We  waited. No one seated us. So we entered the restaurant. Finally the hostess showed up and told us we should have waited in the section. We were confused because she wasn’t very clear. She showed us to our seats. Definitely not friendly. Our waitress seemed to constantly be in a rush. She wasn’t rude. Just not personable. Gave me a dirty water glass. I asked for another glass. She brought it but didn’t remove or apologize for the dirty one. We were freezing where we were seated. Asked the server if we could be moved. She grabbed a manager and said “Could you talk to this lady” and left without another word. Again…rushed.  The manager didn’t move us outside but found another table for us. Our waitress checked on us but again, it was more of a fly by. My food (pasta) was awful! Bland and was served without a pasta spoon. I ate a few bites and left the rest. My husband said his burger was decent. The website description of the restaurant is deceiving. I was exciting to try it. Complete letdown. As we were leaving, the hostess was at the hostess stand in a squatting position talking on her cell. The experience was disappointing. Nothing was good. Not the service and definitely not the food. Read more Very nice place will definitely be back again everything was great  Server Brittany made date night great ! Thank you  Amazing views on both sides! Great cocktails and the e space is HUGE!!  Buena vista del lugar , la comida muy pero muy regular y básica , para los precios, debería ser algo mejor. La variedad es muy escasa y los cócteles no son muy variados. Para ir una vez y no regresar más! Read more We were at Offshore on a rainy Tuesday evening so we stayed inside, it was not crowded or loud.  Despite the weather, the view was amazing.  I would love to host an event here some day, it is the perfect location.  The drinks were delicious, the menu was simple, the food was amazing.  Staff and service was superior. Read more Read more Simple menu, but food was food. The Fish & Chips and fish tacos were really good; seasoned well. My daughter had the burger. She liked it. Service good. Only complaint is the hard plastic water glasses were stained and scratched. Not a great first impression. Beautiful environment Read more Views were great but we waited an hour and 10 minutes, on a night with multiple empty tables, for our food to come out and it was not good. The burger had no flavor and the ahi poke bowl was plain. Would not recommend, especially given the price Read more Out server was very nice. When she noticed we hadn’t received our entrees an hour after we ordered them she took it upon herself to talk to the manager and make sure the kitchen was on it. The cocktails were quite good. The truffle Parmesan fries were good. The steak sliders were good. The fish tacos were a bit weird. The roasted asparagus was very tough because the didn’t trim off the white ends. What’s up with that? Our table looked out on the lake and that was perfect, with the doors open. The music was pretty loud. Read more They sat us outside and it was too dark so we had to hold our phone flashlights up to eat.  Amazing view, great service and the staff was amazing.  Nice to catch up with family.  Food was good and vibe and ambience was great. Our sever was wonderful and quick even gave us Togo drinks! Would definitely recommend ￼  My food was good as expected but my service made my visit even more great. My server Lauren made sure me and my girl was comfortable, had clean utensils, and cups and we appreciated that. She made sure our food was correct and made me for sure want to come back and request her as my server. Read more Beautiful scenery, food was good. Service was above average  Food was mediocre- business dinner 11 of us and there was nothing really that stood out other than the Parmesan truffle fries.  The Offshore Rooftop restaurant at the end of Navy Pier in Chicago was awesome. My bff and I 
 sat outside with a great view of the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan. The food was great. I was hesitant to try it as I don't normally eat raw fish, but I had the Salmon Poke and it was perfection! I definitely want to go back. Read more Read more I tried to order a New York strip and they said it was out. I tried to order a Lavender Lemon Haze drink and it was out this makes me think it’s pre-made. I tried to order their seasonal pasta without artichoke hearts but add steak and they said they couldn’t do that because they thought the artichoke hearts were the main part of the dish. This makes me think it’s precooked, pre-made, or frozen. I ended up ordering the salmon and the salmon itself was bland. The Red Quinoa Corn Succotash that the salmon laid on had all of the flavor which wasn’t much besides onion and lime. Overall very disappointed with the restaurant. Read more Always a great visit to Chicago however my experience at Offshore was flawless. Exceeded my expectations and I’m sure to be back.  We were seated at a table at the back of the restaurant which had no light whatsoever - we had to use the torch on our phone to read the menu or see the food. We ordered a starter which took a long time to arrive and then the main meal arrived very quickly to the point we had no room on the table.
Over priced, and sub standard. Would not recommend even for the view Read more Let’s start with valet parking- it may not an option - if Sable hotel is booked up they will turn you away, which means you have to go back to garage (add 30 min) with Saturday night traffic. Definitely call Sable to see if they are valeting. 

The best parts: View is amazing, it’s not crowded, short wait time, outdoor seating at the high top tables under the globes is perfect DURING the day. Drinks were good, loved the cocktail with grapefruit, served straight up. Food was delicious. The sliders, sushi rolls, fries, wings, fish tacos all were amazing.the sparklers on cake were awesome. We had a problem with the table and the quickly moved us inside. 

The not so great: Asked for my drink to be on the rocks, didn’t come out that way, server was really in the weeds, but it didn’t seem that busy. I got up at least 3 times to ask another server for something. The cost is high for pretty small portions. 1 well gin/tonic was $18. That’s just stupid. If you sit at the high top- the ambiance is amazing- the globes change colors, but because they are fluorescent they attract a lot of bugs the ended up on the table and in food. Then the spiders showed up - 3 times they dropped down and the 4 teen girls just couldn’t handle it.  If you are fine with spiders and bugs- probably would be fine. Read more Poor service- this is my third time with poor service. The food quality is not anything special. The happy hour mimosa special and atmosphere is the only thing to go for.  Great place to eat and view!  Definitely recommend!  This is a great place to go to sit outside and take in the view of Chicago from Navy Pier. Unfortunately, it was too cold and windy to sit outside on that evening. Indoors was OK but the real attraction is the outdoor overlook. The food was good but on the pricey side. We would go there again on a warm, sunny, balmy day. Read more Waitress was absolutely incredible!
Beautiful restaurant.
My entire party enjoyed themselves immensely. We would come back again in a heartbeat. Read more I’ve been here before and there are some changes to the restaurant from previous times. It seems like the restaurant needs an upgrade. The service was great, food was good but the overall decor and menu needs an upgrade. They took a lot of items off the menu like pizza and others things I remember and it’s very limited menu especially with the prices. The chairs and tables need to be upgraded especially was such a nice location. I hope to see some changes nice time go. Read more I would definitely recommend this place 10/10 on everything
