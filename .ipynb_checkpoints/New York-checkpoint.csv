Very limited menu, low price point for average food. Novice waitress service  The food was excellent, but a little overpriced.  I suppose we paid extra for the trendy atmosphere and Times Square location.  The service was very good.  We were a little surprised at a minor bait-and-switch in that we ordered their $4 soda and found that the bottled Coke we received was listed as ""Mexican Coke"" on the bill at a higher price. Read more Excellent service and the food and cocktails were delicious!  The food was great and service was great too. The nachos and elote corn were my favorites  Great Drinks, Appetizers, Sides and Main Courses.  No room for Dessert.  Service was great.  Nice touch for Brunch time was DJ with good music and not overpowering.  Will return again.  This place is a good place, but nothing special except the size. It's another chair-type restaurant in Times Square that is a fine addition, but the food and ambiance are standard. Nothing negative and not a rave, either. I would go again only for the space, Mexican fair and proximity to the theater. Read more Very good house-made guacamole. However tortillas were too bland  Preis Leistung waren gut. Nur leider gab es nicht viel non Alkohol Getränke. 
Es ist etwas frisch im Restaurant.  Aber im großen und ganzen ein normales mexikanisches Restaurant Read more They accommodated our big party of 10 in and special table request the staff from the front of house to the waitress and the manager were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere that was fun and the food was delicious . Read more Read more Tacos were not impressive at all.  Got to Tacos #1 for the best real Mexican street tacos.

Also you can’t order a variety of tacos.  You have to buy three if the same kid if taco for $15 - $20.

The street corn was particularly good, as was the guacamole. Read more The food was prepared incorrectly. The chicken was fatty almost an edible. It was so loud we couldn’t even hear ourselves think.  We had Brunch, the Rainbow Mimosas and food were delish. We enJOYed the steak and eggs and the veggies eggs Benedict. While the food was delicious it wasn't filling enough so we added the fruit salad and the chicken loaded nachos. Read more I was disappointed at the rules.  I made a reservation and when I walked in the Hostess wanted to just sit me at a random table downstairs.  When I said I wanted a table upstairs she got annoyed.  I was told to go up.  I went upstairs and the place looked somewhat empty, on a Friday night!!
I had a 7:30 p.m. reservation and by 8:00 p.m., I was told to hurry up.  The kitchen was about to close.  I was so disappointed.  Things have changed alot at Pink Taco. Read more Completely different from the last time I went food was not as good.  The pink taco had a ton of ambience and a lot of potential, but the food was overall very terrible. For the price I paid for the steak and eggs - The steak was not worth the price and it was not seasoned. The mimosas were decent and their bottomless came with a great value, but overall, I would not eat here again. Read more Nachos were delicious and the service was great. A little too loud but overall good value for NYC  Overpriced Mexican food in Times Square! Fun vibe for a large party, but expensive.  Music was a bit loud. Food was good but the waitress forgot our appetizer  Limited menu but what they have is fantastic. The coconut shrimp tacos were amazing.  Read more Food was delicious, waitress was very nice, and helpful  Fun place in time square for apps and drinks.  Would go again.  Delicious and a beautiful restaurant we happen to hit restaurant week and their special menu was plentiful and an array of choices at a very reasonable price. Definitely a must !!!  The food was really good. I was surprised since it is located in a “tourist” area but it was actually good. The drinks were good too. The service was fast even though they were busy.  The food was good.  The music was very loud and not our taste, however, there were people that enjoyed it.  The server was pretty good.  Everything was great overall the staff were nice & attentive & the food was delicious & drinks were on point I can’t complain  Their 3 course value meal for $30 per person was awesome . Taco icecream was out of the world :)  First time going to this place and I really liked it. The drinks were great, The food was great, The music not so good. I thought that for a Sunday they would’ve had better music.
We were planning to stay longer and decided to go because of the music. Read more Amazing Mexican food.  The staff was super accommodating and service was fast but I didn't feel rushed. Great place for lunch in midtown, when time is a factor.  Had dinner there again & for me the Dirty Sanchez was the perfect cocktail after a long day.

Steak was half the quoted weight (supposedly 29oz but it was 1/2"" thick - so no way), but flavorful.  Fries were bland.  Tuna steak was good but not great.

I went a few years ago and  I found it to be too crowded with seats and high tops too close.
Seems they reconfigured and I can’t wait to get back again Read more we had guests from out of town and they absolutely LOVED it- Thank you Andreas and to the lovely bartender- very kind and attentive!  Great food in a beautiful atmosphere. Service was also on par.  Thoroughly disappointing meal. Hard to imagine how they got it all so wrong. The Limani chips, which are supposed to be light and crisp were almost tempura and chewy. The octopus was mushy in texture. The Greek salad was a bowl of mostly flavorless tomatoes and the soft shell crabs, rather than being lightly battered, were seemingly deep fried as if it was a fish and chips dish. Inattentive service was the icing on the cake. Never again. Read more The food was meh. Lamb chops were so fatty they were inedible. Halibut was good. Filet was ok. I know it’s NYC but $400 for average food for three people is a little much.  Everything was exceptional. The food was so fresh and delicious. Service was spot on.  I Booked Limani -NYC to entertain important clients. 
Our clients had an amazing experience from food, service ambiance. 

We will continue using LiMani for future business dinners. Read more Service was quite spotty - my companions got their wine order but they got mine wrong and had to come back twice to check what I ordered. They also forgot about our side of horta and we had to ask for it.
Quality-wise, the grilled snapper was very good, as was the horta, but the gigante beans were mediocre (tasteless, not cooked through) and the seared tuna entree was too salty.
I’ve been here a few times before and it was good so am disappointed it wasn’t consistent with my previous experiences. Read more It was terribly loud inside the restaurant. Luckily it was a nice day and we opted to eat outdoors. They should do something to the acoustics to soften the noise

The food is very fresh and delicious service was good Read more Read more Limani is my favorite business lunchtime restaurant.  The food is excellent!  It's reasonably priced and the atmosphere is very Mediterranean.  The service is also very good.  I highly recommend! Read more This meal might have been the best Mediterranean meal we’ve had. We were with another couple and they felt the same way. The setting and ambiance beautiful and the waiters were friendly and attentive. A memorable night!❤️ Read more Cauliflower in miso sauce and zucchini & eggplant chips with saganaki appetizers were fantastic.  Swordfish was delicious but halibut was just good - a little dry.  I have been to Limani many times and loved it each time. This time I think the food was not as good as it usually is. Maybe the kitchen was having an off day.  Fantastic. Such a lovely experience! Food was fresh, beautifully presented, and the intimate dining experience was superb.  An amazing experience. The staff was super attentive and the food was just perfect.  Far too loud, not good for business!!  Beautiful atmosphere and top notch food and service.  A bit pricey but well worth it.  Limani was a good experience. Went there with a few colleagues and it was a great restaurant to have a business conversation and meal.  The ambiance was wonderful, an open, well decorated environment. I would highly recommend the octopus as an appetizer. It wa sushi grade, very tender and tasty in with a salad. My wife and I split it as it was a very generous portion. 

We both had lamb chops (3) for dinner and they were delicious. 

The drinks were very good, service a bit sluggish, but not annoyingly so.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and am looking to bringing the whole family to their establishment in Long Island for all to enjoy. Read more Read more The food was very good.  Service was excellent.  Would go back again.  Always a wonderful dining experience. 
Food, service and ambiance make you feel like you’re on vacation. A favorite when I’m in Manhattan.  Limani fried zucchini and eggplant was outstanding! Service excellent. Sat outside because noise level inside very loud. Weather beautiful so outdoor made for nice evening.  Great food, even better service, good wine list - highly recommend.  Chic, modern ambience & excellent menu. Service was disappointing, however—appetizers were served together despite a request to have them separately. Also, when we used a few credit cards to pay the bill, our server was rude & uncooperative. For an upscale restaurant, we expected much better. Read more Truly some of the best fish I’ve ever eaten. Go for the Dover Sole - bit pricey but melts in your mouth. The mixed grilled vegetables were also outstanding. The orange cake with ice cream also a solid 5 stars!

We’ll be back! Read more I have been to Limani many many times for lunch and it never disappoints. This time I tried the shrimp and avocado appetizer which was quite good although scallops are still my favorite appetizer. For the main I got shrimp with feta cheese which I’ve had before. It was good but I think the salmon is still my favorite. And I got the orange olive oil cake which was quite good for dessert.

When I made the reservation I indicated that it was for a birthday. I very very much appreciate that Lumani took this to heart and, when dessert arrived, had a little lit candle in a strawberry to wish my friend happy birthday. A very very nice touch. Thank you Limani. Read more Fabulous restaurant.  The ambiance was cool and stylist with a beautiful water feature in the centre of the restaurant.  The staff were attentive and helpful.  We choose  several Limani specialties and shared them as our main.  The server suggested he stager their arrival which worked perfectly.  This restaurant is definitely worth a return visit.

The margarita was 3/4 full and they replied that they measure the drinks in ounces and that’s why it was not a full glass - they did however re do the order and brought me a full glass. Additionally - I ordered the hummus and veggie platter and sent that back as the carrots and celery were so dried and old they looked dead and for $25 for a scoop of hummus and small dish of tzatziki and some pita bread was pathetic. Don’t know what this restaurant is thinking or not thinking but a miss on all items. Read more We had a great experience. The food was fantastic, specially the Steak&Frites and the Pasta Nera. Also the staff was super friendly and attentive. Thank you guys!  Nice variety on the brunch menu. Food presentation was very pleasing. Wait staff gave us plenty of time to just sit and chat. Silly us though….15% of check was for bottled water. Should have asked before ordering so many bottles.

Definitely noisy but good and service was excellent  They got my order wrong 1st off, the Pokè bowl wasn’t anything special either.  The food was very nice as was the venue. Nice ambience and very friendly staff that completed the experience.  Would recommend !  Had an early dinner with my sisters. Food was delicious, service attentive and polite. We ordered appetizers and drinks from the happy hour menu. The tuna rice cakes as an appetizers were tasty and my main dish was the seared scallops. Cleared my plate! Would definitely return. Read more Read more Overall good.  Nice menu.  A bit pricey.  Food was good but not amazing.  Nice place and great food and ambience. Loved the sirniki  First time there for dinner- it was quite loud. The space felt like a cafeteria though the food and service were good. It’s expensive for what it is.  The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. We ordered 5 dishes that were all on point. The wait staff was mia for long periods of time which was annoying.  Very pleased with the food and service at L'Adresse. We came for brunch.  The food was wonderful, everything came out as ordered in a timely fashion. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. It was a little loud but spacious and a very nice atmosphere.  I really like the menu - but it's pricey and the noise level is disconcerting  Cocktails were good.  Service was quick.  But the service was unremarkable.  Will not go back.  The food was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be returning.  food and service were excellent. Drinks were a little skimpy.  Read more Best burgers I’ve had since we moved to CA! Was sooo good!  The fish was good, unfortunately the mash potetos were flat. The service did a great job  Food around mid town is in fact mid, but for a good brunch/lunch this is a good spot to go with family. And they have a good mimosa special.  Excellent service great food would definitely go back  Good food and location. We would go back when back in NY  Great food, drinks and location. Easy to get to and close to Bryant park.  Really good food. amazing cocktails. Definitely recommend the lamb. Great place for vegetarian minded diners too  I am a personal chef from LA. I come to NY every year for inspiration. This restaurant was uneventful. I chose the vegan option to see the quality of the vegetables. Let’s just say they were not fresh. Watered down taste to the carrots and zucchini. The tzatziki should have been thrown out. There was no taste. The hummus was fair.
In my kale salad I found a little twig. Whatever I spit out. I appreciate the crispness of the quinoa. But again there was no love in the food. The wine selection I had was nice. But come on show me love in my food! Read more Food was delicious and the service was great! Very cool vibe  Server was excellent. Really top notch & a super personality. The rest of the staff was very attentive. The only lesser plate was the Brick Chicken which was dry. Also the side of roasted vegetables was overcooked & really not roasted/charred. Specials were excellent & desserts were excellent as well with great aperitif  pairing suggestions. I liked that they allowed us to bring in wine & the corkage fee was fair ($35).

Server was constantly coming over to clear the plates and it felt a little rushed.  Great and fast service ambiance was great music was lovely drinks great  Giovanni was our waiter and was extremely rude. He states after the fact that there was a time limit once we got our food late and proceeded to bring us the check to close my guest and I out. Then kept coming every 5-10 mins to see if we placed our payment method for the bill and proceeded to say we need to clear the table and we can continue our meal at the bar! I had to take our food in hand and walk to the bar to complete our meal which was not possible since the area was full. There were parties that were there before my guests and I and was not instructed the same rules and were able to fully enjoy their night without being told to move until they were ready. We wanted to remove the mandatory gratuity that was placed and was told it’s not possible due to it being a “POT” that they all shared and that the waiter was having a bad day! Respectfully, that is not our problem and they can blame Giovanni for there missed tip. The manager was not available (of course) and was told to send a email. This will be my last time visiting this restaurant. Read more I went for restaurant week 
Everything on the menu has an additional cost 
To the prefix price 
Overly expensive 
Food is good- but they’ve exceeded their expectations! 
My total was $567 dinner for 3 and drinks Read more Waitress was nice and did a little of her job as far as checking on the table....however the cameraman came to take our picture more than someone can to refill water in our cup. I came for happy hour and also a birthday which I stated when I reserved ask for the menu to be customized noone never responded at the end of the dinner didn't even say Happy birthday but already put a 70$ tip. Now happy  hour is not happy hour it's buy 1 get 1 small frozen drink free... the happy hour drinks came 45$. The food was nasty tasted like it was heated up, and as many times the bus boys came looking for dishes felt like we were being rushed. I do not recommend Panda of Harlem unless you don't mind wasting money Read more This is my first time going to panda Harlem, and I loved it so much. The ambiance was perfect they had great music, hookah. Everyone was dressed well and enjoying there date. This is a perfect date night with the girls. The food was 10/10.

I had a great birthday  I was hoping to do brunch or the prefixed menu for restaurant week but being that I was a party of 1, including my 2 year old son, I wasn't allowed. So basically I had to pay full price for everything. Otherwise food was decent.

Read more The food down to everything  was a 10/10 I could eat here everyday  Everything was nice the music wasn’t too loud and we only did appetizers and they were pretty good.

Good vibes spot on 
Excellent service  I love Panda. Food and drinks are always great! Service is always top tier. Definitely a great vibe for date night, girls night, brunch or happy hour.  Read more This place is a cash grab and scam. Came during happy hour and was still charged full price for drinks. Should have stuck to the appetizers.  Ordered the colossal lobster which the waiter said could feed 2-3 people but most of it tasted like monk fish. If you know you know. There were no lobster claws but many parts of fried shell.  We had a wobbly table causing our drinks to spill. Instead of moving us to another table or providing fresh drinks they fixed the table while we sat.  Lastly the gratuity was already included for a party of 2.  Never again.  Check your bill closely. Read more It was Outstanding. And my waiter Ralph was the best of it all.  We had a great time. Drinks were too sweet but food and vibe was everything.  Great service love this place drinks are great food is amazing  Food was actually great came out pretty fast!! The hookah was perfect lol, and variety of different songs/genres overall my experience was great except the customer service I feel like they need to fire more waiters/servers instead of having 1 juggle multiple tables by their self but I can’t complain I enjoyed my time. Read more I ordered the Dinner Prix Fixe Menu for $45.  Vegetable Spring Rolls, Vegetable Lo Mein (I paid extra to add shrimp) and the Cheesecake (out of Red Velvet Cake).  My meal was quite tasty.

I didn't like if one individual in your party ordered from the Prix Fixe Menu, the entire party had to follow suit.  

The music playing was lively and appreciated.  I didn’t care for the Hookah smoke (our 74 years old Mother was present) but it certainly didn’t damper our evening. Read more Everything was great. Had some family running late and they worked with us to make it a great Mother's Day. I will be going back there.  Loveeeeee this place. Definitely always a vibe!! Everything was elite.

As we arrived we were nicely greeted by the hostess.  Had some sparkling to kick off the evening, a nice light Cava, plus a bottle of Bordeaux, which was rich and fresh to go with the meal.  For starters we tried the onion soup, it was flavorful plus the escargot’s that were a bit dry.  Main courses were the evening special, Cassoulet, for my husband.  The portion was hearty yet it lacked flavor.  I had the oven baked sea bass and it was delicious.  To finish the meal we shared some Crêpés Suzette.  They lacked the orange zest as well as the Grand Marnier flavor.  Overall service was excellent. Read more Love LeMonde, the service is impeccable and the food is delicious and consistent!!  Loved it! Good food, great service. Our waiter Chance was charming.  We ate outside again and the food was excellent as usual.  Good food and nice atmosphere. On several visits the servers have been pleasant and helpful, but there haven't been enough of them.  Service was a bit slow and the waiter barely noticed me.  The menu board was sticky. It seemed like a server wanted me to get out quickly.  The venue is charming! So lovely - a wonderful menu selection - the food was delicious- the best croque monsieur I have had and we were not rushed!!
Lovely! Read more Jason, our server was extremely engaging and helpful. Exceptional ability to exert calm confidence with smiling eyes !!  Sadly, it was my birthday celebration and the evening was not optimal. There were only 2 of us and I was the only one who had a glass of champagne, and we only ordered a main course. However, the main course took over 35-40 minutes to arrive at our table. The restaurant was not crowded, so I can’t imagine what caused the extreme delay. Additionally, we had to ask for bread for the table. Although the hostess kindly brought me a half glass of champagne for my special day. Then I ordered an Apple tart with ice cream which was completely burned and inedible. We were then brought an Apple crepe free of charge, but the apples were raw and the crepe was more of a thin pancake than a crepe. The waiter and hostess were lovely, but the evening was pretty much a bomb. Not how I thought I’d be spending my birthday with my boyfriend. Read more  Wonderful French Bistro. Outside quieter. Service good. Prices average. Great neighborhood spot even if you don’t live in that neighborhood!’  Our waiter, Jason, was exceptionally attentive and helpful with all of our requests. The food was delicious. The noise level was a bit too high for my taste.  What a lovely representation of a Parisian bistro sitting right on Broadway on the Upper West side.  The menu is broad, the wine list also offers choices for all tastes.  We had decided what we were going to order until our waiter suggested the short ribs - a special last night.  We followed his suggestion and were treated to the most delicious perfect dinner to share.

We are often disappointed by the welcomes offered by hosts at restaurants.  The young lady who seated us last night welcomed us in and genuinely seemed happy to see us.  She told us she was a recent hire - to the owners, keep her around!!

Mostly we'd like to thank Ashany for making our evening.  His attention to us was outstanding and again, his suggestion for dinner was spot on.  He anticipated our every need before we even thought to ask.  

Our first time at Le Monde - definitely not our last! Read more I love Le Monde. Although it is noisy at certain times, the food and the service are great.

Excellent choice when at Columbia University! The Lunch Tray option is a brilliant idea.

I would’ve loved to have had the quinoa but he cautioned me the portion was very small. And that was the experience of the other three that we died with.

Our Newest restaurant just Opened in the Times Square District. In the heart of our New York City.
We are located in the corner of 50th street and 8th Avenue.
Best New Pre - Theater menu. We are open from 7 am - 1 am.","This was not as good an experience as other times. There were several mistakes in the order with cold or undercooked food. The server was inattentive.  It was just ok. Chaotic when we arrived as there are 2 entrances and people came in from all directions. No where to wait properly which when there are 30+ people it’s a bit awkward. Food was meh, they put tomato on my husband’s sandwich when we asked for none and with the staff being so busy there was no opportunity to ask for a new one. My meatball sandwich was cold. It was just a really poor diner experience wish we had gone somewhere else. Read more There were just two of us for dinner and we didn’t know that you could half the portions until the very end when we queried the waiter.

The portions are very large. The food is mediocre. The restaurant has a great location! ￼ Read more Amazing selection; something for everybody. The pastrami was melt in your mouth good. Bronzino was cooked perfectly and the shakes!  Food came out quickly and our server was incredibly friendly. Will be back often!!! Read more La peor experiencia en un restaurante! Servicio pésimo!!! Sentado en el bar me atendió el camarero con el trato más desagradable que pueda existir.  Pedí unos huevos Benedict Classic y me pregunta que como quiero los huevos? 😳 Incluso una señora (muy amable) a mi lado le dijo: Los huevos Benedict’s son ponchados a lo que respondió: Es el sistema que lo pide. Le dije sunny side por elegir alguno. Para mi sorpresa llegaron 2 huevos sunny side encima de un pan sin salsa ni absolutamente nada!
Pregunté a otro bartender y me respondió que si quería salsa me la traerían sin ningún costo adicional! En ese momento llegó el otro camarero diciendo que así son los huevos Benedictinos. Ya se imaginan mi incomodidad, ni lo probé y pedí la cuenta, sin ni siquiera preguntar si había pasado algo? Me cobraron. Una experiencia decepcionante! Deduje que este restaurante se enfoca más en la rapidez con que las mesas se desocupan que enfocarse en la satisfacción al cliente! Una gran pena, ya que pienso que sus dueños deben tener otro concepto pero mal aplicado por sus empleados. Read more The food was tasty and it had a fun ambience for families!  Nothing but good vibes – terrific service on a busy Friday night. Food was very good. Noise was earsplitting. We would definitely come back.  Service was amazing.  Food was very good! Perfect place to eat before a Broadway Show!  Incredibly mediocre. Made a reservation and still waited 10 minutes; too frenzied for a restaurant that's serving a pre theatre crowd. Food was nothing special.  Save your money and avoid this scam of a restaurant. Zero love in the food here - nothing tasted fresh and they should be ashamed at what they call pastrami. It definitely was not made in house and tasted frozen. No possible way that was wagyu beef like the menu says. Boars Head from Sysco at best. Overcrowded and the service was terrible (Manager didn’t even know what the house vodka was!). Typical churn and burn mentality of all these theater district restaurants. Read more  We had booked a table but still waited over 45minutes to be seated and were clearly in the way of the(visibly irritated) servers.

We ended up sitting outside on a very wobbly table

Our order was wrong, wrong items, wrong eggs, wrong cooking preference, and was pretty cold

The staff were nice though! Read more We had a fantastic brunch here. I had the lobster roll which had lots of big chunks of lobster and is was excellent. My husband had a chicken sandwich which was delicious too! The service was great! Read more Steady in quality and service. We cone back everytime we visit NYC.  Decent enough food, but totally chaotic environment, inattentive server, and way overpriced for the “quality” of food served. Ridiculous. Never Again.  A fun place with lots of vibe but food choices and quality do not live up to the heralded name it pays homage to.  Food and drinks was amazing the service was ok and the ambulance was great.  Food was below average, service was slow and not great, and the bathrooms were disgusting.  Service was wonderful.  Waitress fabulous and adorable  We had a 2:00 show and a 1:00 reservation. I was a bit nervous, but they are very fast. Food was good - not amazing - its a diner type place after all. It definitely served its purpose.  There is consistency in the quality of the food and the staff are always pleasant.   Love this place! Bright and clean - service is prompt and friendly and food is delicious!  Went for brunch, my wife had the Omlette, I had the Eggs Benedict. If you go, make sure you make a reservation. The best thing was how quickly we were seated. My wife enjoyed her omlette but my eggs Benedict were super disapointing. The English muffin was hard, the eggs were overdone, and there was one sliver of ham which couldn’t even cover an English muffin round per half. I say ham because to call it “Canadian Bacon” is an affront to both Canadians and Bacon. The photo on the menu is so far off from what you receive on the plate would make a top tier “Expectation vs. Reality” meme. All suffice to say, Carnegie Diner will be a skip from here on out… Read more Great place in the city to grab some descent inexpensive food. Quick service, too.  Best Diner in town. Food delicious. Thanks for hosting us  The food was delicious. The portions were generous. This is a very popular and crowded New York brunch spot so do expect to wait a few minutes even with a reservation, but it won’t be long. The server had many tables but was attentive. It was raining in NYC on the day I went, and Carnegie was a nice spot to get out of the rain and have it good meal. The artwork on the walls are portraits of famous musicians, and I enjoyed looking at them while waiting for my order. I would recommend this restaurant. Read more The Hostess was not nice and didn't care that we had reservations until someone else came over got involved and fixed it...Otherwise worth the trip!!  Other that the long wait even though we had a reservation, the food and service was great!  Good deli food but prices are still higher than expected  We went for pre-theatre dinner.  Everything was delicious. Service was outstanding.  We always enjoy eating here when we visit the city. Great menu options, everything is delicious, and service is always great.

It is a tiny place so you will be cozy with strangers but it works.  Great food and drinks, very nice ambience. Cool place and the team was very nice.  The only person in our party who enjoyed their food was my wife.  She ordered the Gnochhi and enjoyed it.  Other than that the apps and entrees were sub par at best!  Would not recommend!  Great atmosphere and kind service! Would definitely recommend!  My 25-year-old daughter and I visited NYC for her first time, and we decided to stop at The Blue Dog Cookhouse and Bar before heading to see SIX on Broadway – and wow, what an incredible experience!

From the moment we walked in, the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made us feel welcome right away. Every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious, but the standout was the burger. My daughter said it was the BEST burger she’s ever had in her life – high praise from someone who knows her way around good food!

Absolutely incredible food. The Israeli breakfast and the marinated beets were outstanding!  Staff were so lovely and helpful with our group (which included a toddler who loved her fancy French toast). Great brunch spot!  problem was the lamb shank had way too little meat on it it was basically a bone surrounded by rice and this was better before when we had come last time most of the people at our table ordered the lamb shank and we’re also equally disappointed other than that the appetizers are always excellent services great and desserts are delicious Read more Very nice place.

Food and ambiance  So noisy. Hot a stuffy. The chicken schnitzel was just a breaded cutlet that you make at home. The chicken tasted vile. It tasted like a frozen chicken finger you buy at a grocery store.  The cutlet was burnt. But also the breading was falling off. Read more The restaurant was too dark. We could barely see our food. The noise level was too high. I liked the menu and the variety of middle eastern options and plate sizes but the prices were high given the portion sizes. They should include a vegetable with the entrees. I had the branzino with Israeli couscous and thought it was tasty. The whipped salmon meze was good but should have included bread or pita and not required us to order extra bread. Read more We ate outside, quiet! Food (esp the small plates) is always terrific. Cocktails are wonderful too.  Always great food.  Service was slow yesterday.  Maybe understaffed?  Tend to be noisy depending on where you are seated.

Had nice lunch, food delicious, service attentive, was great for lunch with conversation.  WOW. Most excellent brunch; food was surprising and perfectly executed. Service was top notch.  Love Dagon! Favorite restaurant on the UWS. Ambiance is beautiful and the food is absolutely delicious. The spicy feta, muhamarra, shishbarak , kubaneh and chicken schnitzel are my faves! Their brunch is also fab. Read more Mezzes are very good but fish kabobs are tasteless and the Lebanese dumplings stuffed with mushrooms are only rich tasting but not tasty—boring  Overall experience was fantastic. Waiter was a little quirky, but helpful.
Only thing was we ordered the cheesecake from the restaurant week menu, only to receive basically a cup of cream with some apple caramel at the bottom. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't cheesecake. I wouldn't even have cared until they brought a real piece of cheesecake over to the table next to us. Just let me a little confused and kinda...you know... wanting the cheesecake. Read more Just ok.  slow (if competent) service, food very mixed.  Veg tagine not good.  Cheese borek very good. desserts ok.  nice place to sit, otherwise very forgettable.  The meze were all terrific and, if we had thought to order more, would have made a perfect meal in themselves. But that would have meant missing the harissa BBQ chicken, which would have been tragic. 

We came to Dagon for exactly this — fresh and exciting food. The only challenge is that many others seem to come for loud drinking, which was distracting.

Otherwise all good !  More about the ambiance and theatrics than the quality of the food. Food was good but not amazing.  Fantastic. That’s my review. And this is for my character minimum.  Service was amazing!! Food was so delicious!! Can’t wait to come back.  We were left unattended for 30 mins by our waiter who forgot to place one of our orders.

Decor is fabulous. It just feels good but has some fairly striking architectural details that are satisfying without being distracting.

The food was so much better than I expected. I really enjoyed every single bite. Visually beautifully presented. The portions were ample and thus the value for what we paid was terrific.

I had the Chef's Choice sushi and sashimi combination that comes with a roll of my choice. It was absolutely the perfect amount of food and extremely reasonable. It was presented with a mist of dry ice that impressed all the tables around us.

My dinner-mate had two rolls and although he's a good eater, he could not finish all of one of the rolls. He kept offering it because it was so good he didn't want it to go to waste, however I was too full.

The Miso soup is ample and delicious. Very flavorful without being too heavy.

Our waitress was very nice, but we felt like she kept pushing us to order before we were ready. We are just gotten together after not seeing each other for a long time and we needed a little time to settle in. I appreciate prompt service, but we must have told her 5 or 6 times that we weren't quite ready to order. It wasn't as though the restaurant was full and they needed to turn over the table. It was too late for another full seating and there were plenty of open tables on a Sunday evening. We simply could not understand why she was being so pushy to take our orders.

With the exception of that note, it couldn't have been a more perfect evening. Read more I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. We split the pork Gyoza as our appetizer.

Great food in a beautiful atmosphere. Service was also on par.  Thoroughly disappointing meal. Hard to imagine how they got it all so wrong. The Limani chips, which are supposed to be light and crisp were almost tempura and chewy. The octopus was mushy in texture.

Quality-wise, the grilled snapper was very good, as was the horta, but the gigante beans were mediocre (tasteless, not cooked through) and the seared tuna entree was too salty.

The server was helpful and wonderful. I would absolutely recommend this place!  Until yesterday, I'd only ever been to Carmine's at Times Square. The Upper West location was much more peaceful and a bit smaller than TS which was great. Other than that, I don't think I'd return to this location for any other reason.

First, it was my birthday, which I noted in my reservation. It wasn't mentioned or acknowledged in any way, so I'm not sure what the point of noting special occasions in my reservation is. The bread was cold and hard when it came to the table. We had the mixed seafood pasta which came out piping hot, but unfortunately the lobster was overcooked and the seafood in general under seasoned.

I had the 3 eggs any style with focaccia. It was good. My husband had the omelet, also good. the reason for the lower score was that my husband purchased what specifically said was fresh juice and it was in a bottle.  The waitress just handed us the bottle for 15 (small bottle, one serving). Don't say its fresh juice when you serve it in a bottle!  we ate outside and it was perfect in terms of ambience. Read more Took a while to get our food but it was good and cheap  Yummy food but silly small portions for the price. The sandwich and omelette don’t come with anything, for example. At $22 and $18 respectively, that just doesn’t make sense. Putting that aside, it’s a great vibe and tasty. Read more My group of 5 had a great experience.

Food was well seasoned and tasty.  The food was fantastic. The drinks (cocktails) were horrible. The service was absolutely terrible. They were nice but not responsive or attentive.  The food was very good, but the service was terrible.  First it took our waiter about 15-20 minutes to bring our drink order.  Then, another person brought out our entrees before the appetizer.  It was very disorganized considering how empty it was, but the one factor that was positive was the freshness and quality of the food.  The spaghetti bolognese and chicken parmigiana were both very good. Read more The food that we ended up getting was good, but the service was poor. The guys doing bread, water, clearing, were great, but the actual waitress was rather clueless - never asked about more drinks, tried to offer us dessert when we’d only had our salad, had to ask us to repeat what we ordered several times after only getting salad, some of which we still never got. The chickpea salad and rigatoni were excellent, so it was a shame the rest of the experience was not great. Read more Delightful little restaurant.

We all agreed that this was the best Italian food we have had in a long time. Served family style, we had the seafood pasta special, which was more than enough food.

MASSIVE portions… just be aware.  The portion should be sized by the amount of people at the table. You should have size per the number of people at the table. It was entirely too much food for two people, and the bill was a little bit too high. We had Edwin for our waiter. He was very nice although he was very overworked.

Good but not great.  The food was fabulous. The service was good, though had to call people over in order to be able to get plates cleared and to get our check. The biggest problem was that my 93-year-old mother needed to use the elevator in order to be able to get upstairs to use the bathroom. The elevator requires someone else to be on the other side upstairs in order to open it up. There was no one there and she was locked in the elevator for 10 minutes, not knowing when she was going to be able to get out and we almost missed our theater curtain. The only reason she got out was because someone else in our party had to go track someone down from the restaurant in order to be able to get her out. She was incredibly upset and I don’t blame her.

Many times, it is the server that can make or break the experience.   Last night our dinner was wonderful, (the portions are huge--i took leftovers home,) but it was the server who listened to what we wanted, especially how to make and not make the martini, and conveyed it to the bartender and our drinks were perfect.   For me, that alone is a reason to return. Read more It was our first time at Elea and we went with great anticipation.  We love Greek food and seafood.  The place was packed and we were happy that we could get a table outside because there was no way we'd be able to talk inside.  Our first disappointment was that they were out of grouper.  We ordered humuus and calamari.  Both were very good and so was the pita the humuus was served with.  However, our mains were another story.  I had lavraki and my husband had halibut.  Both were way too salty and the halibut was overcooked, served with soggy vegetables.   I'm not sure how our daughters liked their dishes since they didn't say anything about them, but one daughter mentioned that her cocktail wasn't very good. This restaurant just doesn't compare to our favorite Greek restaurant, which has several locations in the city, so we won't be returning to Elea.

The room is cheerful and high-ceilinged, the tables comfortable and well-spaced, the crowd upbeat and considerate, with that happy UWS buzz of people having a good time, the food (the fish, the lamb and, surprisingly, the chicken, perfectly prepared, and the wine list is intelligent and not too pricey.  The service is highly professional and unusually friendly (Nick is a great waiter, and the busmen are attentive and servers know who-gets/what.). A word about management:  everything goes like clockwork, I’m no small part because there is always at least one friendly manager on the floor seeing that things go right.  Cheers to Yiannis! Read more I was excited to eat here as we are Greek and our family has owned restaurants. I brought three people with me as my guests for dinner. I had made reservations and the restaurant wasn’t completely full. We were put outside as we had asked, but we were seated at a table furthest from the restaurant on a sloped, crooked sidewalk. The table was so slanted that all of the liquid would fall to the downhill portion of our plates. I was extremely uncomfortable. I have a bad back and because of the way that the sidewalk was, it made the chair and table crooked. In a short while, I was in pain. I mentioned it to three or four people, and no one really responded. Not one person apologized. No one offered to move us, I just think that they must know that that table is bad and clearly did not care. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a restaurant that didn’t really care about whether their diners are comfortable. I did not really want to complain in front of my guests, but I let them know at the restaurant and no one offered to move us. I would highly recommend the restaurant for the food, but stay away from the tables at the outdoor dining lower right section because they are not comfortable and no one should be sitting there, unless you’re like 10.

What has been true for thirty years is that no matter whether you order an appetizer of  country pate or smoked salmon or an entree of crepes or beef bourguignon, the dishes are always prepared beautifully and taste delicious.

It’s the best meal there is and just off Columbus Avenue. Read more Excellent service, good food.  A bit crowded and noisy.  Consistently exceptional food, well timed, great staff...a neighborhood gem  Second visit, best so far.  Menu was varied and reasonably priced, as were the wines.  Servers were very attentive.

Great French bistro good food good service close to Lincoln center  Read more Service intolerably slow in an early Saturday night. We are talking 530 to 6 here. My wife’s dish of Lamb Stew was quite good and tender.  The pate appetizer on the other hand was bland. My appetizer of mushroom ravioli was tepid and in a watery sauce. Seemed liked in was heated in the microwave.
The Duck entre was dry and tasteless even with the cranberry sauce.
The chocolate mousse dessert was delicious.
Overall I would pass on returning to this restaurant as there were not enough positives for us to return. Value poor. Read more The food was delicious! The best dish was the seafood crepes.  Cramped space, tables jammed too close to one another, food was just OK, service was good and the overall vibe is nice - but as many restaurants these days the the prices are inflated and the meal was not worth the end tab. Read more Disappointed. Prefixe gone. Prices raised, and food mediocre.  This is a classic, old guard French restaurant, featuring all the expected basics--onion soup, escargot, coq au vin, steak frites etc. I had the salmon in mustard sauce--delicious, just delicious.

Excellent food in a lovely atmosphere.Very helpful and friendly server. overall a very good experience. will definitely go back .  Just what the Westside needed, a buzzy italian with modern decor, a crowded dining room and expectations of a great meal. Well not exactly  the menu descriptions promise alot-a pistacho sauce with grilled beets and foccacio, a meal in itself portions were so large which in hindsight was fortuitous because my main a buckwheat caniloni stuffed with spinach ricotta and something.decidedly unpleasant and sitting in a pool of barely cooked tomatoes sauce fresh out of a jar was inedible  two orders of pasta with scallops were okay although we calculated that the chopped up bits of scallops probably equally one very tasteless scallops  the dessert a lemon curd on a shortbread crust had us reminiscing about childhood hellos and packaged desserts. And the service didn't help  a bus boy who was a waste of space except when he was grabbing plates and wishing away silverware without bringing replacements. I finally borrowed a knife from my companion.

I chose this place because of its proximity to the Beacon Theater but let me tell you, I’ve found us a restaurant that we’ll definitely be going back to ,across town, again and again. Everything we ate was incredibly delicious! Can’t wait to go back! Read more Tried this restaurant due to its proximity to the Beacon Theater. The bread and salad were delicious, and the buckwheat cannelloni was an interesting and tasty dish. The reason for my lower rating was our other dish, the pasta with scallops and lemon. The scallops were shredded in the dish which was a bit unusual, but there were only maybe 2 total scallops in the dish. A $34 seafood/pasta dish rally should contain more than 2 scallops in my opinion. On a positive note, our waiter was very attentive and the Amaro list is extensive, something you don't see in many restaurants. Read more Staff was attentive. ....

My husband and kid ordered french toast, he got to measly baguette pieces cut in diagonal with some fruit for $18.  Two of the other kids ordered a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, it was $24 each. The coffee was sour. I don’t mind paying good money when the food is good, but this one was below average. Overall it was a very disappointing experience. Read more Great food. Great moctails. A little noisy due to loud fellow diners. But Lido is one of our favorite restaurants!  As always, the food was great. What was not so great was the service from our particular servers. No smiles, no pleasantries, no “thank you” when tipped or even a good night. Our server never introduced himself and seemed really impatient. The other waitstaff were a bit unpleasant. It was a stark contrast from any other time I’ve eaten at Lido’s and it was noticeable. I’m a fan and will return but I hope to have a better experience.

Read more Another lovely evening, bringing friends in the City for their first visit. Abdul was a super awesome server. Perfect balance of friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

Everything was delicious as usual. Seemed like portions were smaller than usual - presumably a way to improve food costs and profitability. Just meant no leftovers to take home and I’m okay with that. (American portion sizes are ridiculous anyway!)

My only gripe, and it’s pretty minor, is that out table was really too small for a party of 4. I didn’t think to ask for a different table until we’d already been served drinks, and by then it seemed like more of a fuss than it need be. A good time was had by all, and it made sharing dishes and desserts easier in the long run. Read more Atmosphere is obviously best part of tavern on the green. Food is also very good. The noise level is not bad given how many people. Service is meh honestly.  We've eaten at Tavern several times, and today was by far the worst experience. We were unfortunately seated by the bar, which meant that staff kept bumping into my husbands chair. The staff spilled our water on the table at least twice. We ordered a bottle and there was no room on the table for the huge bucket and our food so I had to place it on the booth next to me.

The prosecco and wine we ordered were very small amounts. Not standard pours. When I asked our server if my glass of prosecco was condsidered a full glass, he shrugged and said, ""I think so."" And did nothing to remedy it. My lamb was mediocre and the mashed sweet potatoes that came on the side were piled on top of two banana slices. ?? My husband's steak was a welcome large portion. However, the amount of potatoes on the side was measly as well as soggy.  In addition, the music did not fit the setting at all. 70's and 80's pop hits. I would have much preferred classical or jazz.

Incredible quality in food and service that would have justified a higher price than what we paid. (Not cheap, mind you, but a solid meal at an appropriate price.) Would highly recommend. Read more Great service. Very accommodating & helpful staff

Incredibly loud. We had to ask to be moved from the main dining room to the bar room because 2 of us started to get a migraine headache

Food was ok.

- Tempura & bread apps very nice
- Lambs overly spiced & overcooked (chef recommmeded medium)
- Hangar steak was hard to identified w all the spices & overcooking (asked for medium rare)

Seating is u def a lovely black-framed atrium. The menu is varied with many seafood entrees and several GF choices, important to me. The lamb chop and octopus were fresh & perfectly cooked. We will return some day. Read more Honestly this was pretty mediocre for what was expected to be a nice city restaurant. It was quiet and clean but the service was spotty. The seabass was basically a slab of fish on a plate swimming in oil. The drink with a mushroom in it was supposed to be earthy but tasted like beef bouillon with alcohol mixed in. Read more The service was really good! Our waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations. The drinks were awesome! We asked for a mojito which was off menu and it was incredible. We were with a group of 4, each of us got something different and it was all so good. Everyone’s plate wiped clean lol we will definitely be back! Read more We were disappointed all the way around with this restaurant.  The hostess in the bar was fairly rude and didn't even acknowledge me when I entered. She walked by me a couple of times and didn't ask if she could help or even say hello.  When the person who seemed to be her boss saw me she was much more friendly and helpful.  We were seated promptly and our server was pleasant but didn't seem to know much about the menu.  The appetizer we ordered didn't even remotely resemble what she had described and was not very good (I still don't know what it was).  One of the guests in our party ordered a whisky drink and he said it tasted like apple cider (he thinks they forgot the whisky!).  I had the lamb and it was delicious and cooked perfectly (one star for that!).  My husband had the steak and the waitress offered to put the jalapeno chimichurri on the side when he asked how it was served.  He said, yes that would be great because he was a bit hesitant about it.  When the food came out the steak was covered with the chimichurri.  The runner offered to take it back and scrape it off, but my husband declined (he could scrape it off himself).  The steak was completely overpowered by the jalapeno and not at all what he wanted.  The meal wasn't inexpensive so you would expect much better execution  and more courteous staff.  We won't go back... Read more Food took a very long time but it was delicious .  It was a bit difficult to find the restaurant.  The sign on the street was tiny and it is inside a hotel with a different name. We walked into the bar and said we had dinner reservations - so the hostess sent us to the roof. When we got to the roof the hostess there checked our name and sent us back downstairs.  The original hostess then sat us in the bar and I explained we had dinner reservations.  She said this was fine.  Then I asked about the Prefix and she went to get someone else.  A young man appeared to take us to the dining room. It was all a little weird.
I ordered the Heirloom Tomato salad and hanger steak. I'm not sure the tomato was a ""heirloom"" and it wasn't very ripe. Disappointing.  It was served with too much basil mousse. The hanger steak was decent. 
Service was very good except for the beverage server who came to our table and refilled the water glasses EVERY (no exaggeration)  time we took a drink. It was disruptive.
Altair caters to the theater crowd and we were eating after the matinee and catching a train home. We missed the first train  waiting for our check. Read more Lonely dinner, dining room and amazing service
It was a gem in the  midst of a very tourist trap area. 
Will come back to check out the bar also  The roof is fine, views are mid but at least you’re outside.  What a great experience!

Favorite: Hamachi, Herloom tomato, Hanger steak and castella cake.  Really nice and calm atmosphere with friendly staff. It’s a hidden gem definitely coming back soon.  Food was very good but for a hotel the service was lacking. Waited over 15 mins for our drinks and additional 30 mins for our food. They brought the wrong drink and even charged it wrong on the bill. In general, not the level of professionalism we expected from a restaurant in such a nice hotel.
Also we noticed that people were constantly moving tables because they were seated directly under the AC and others put on jackets. Maybe if nearly all guests are cold it would be a good call to turn the AC down. Read more Our second time dining here and it was a very nice evening. Food was interesting and delivered quickly, the tomato salad & the steak were the standouts. The restaurant is a pretty space with a lively bustle, dining early might be preferable for noise.

Our group shared the starter bread, gnocchi and the endive and melon salad. We practically inhaled it. For main: I had the Long Island duck which was cooked to perfection.

My wife and I were celebrating the 20th anniversary of the best blind date ever, where we met at the bar of Nice Matin on October 6, 2004, and never looked back. I would like to thank the management and staff of these past 20 years for doing the insanely hard work of keeping Nice Matin a special place that we have wanted to and been able to come back to again and again.

Nice Matin is consistently superb, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This time it was breakfast, and what a joy to find that the chef turns out real omelettes (one avocado, one Gruyère), rather than the flattened scrambled eggs usually served elsewhere.  Add really fresh squeezed orange juice and great coffee and you’ll think the set charge ($24.95) is a steal, which it is.

Arriving on time, the special gathering at the restaurant continued well beyond 6pm, with little apparent efforts to move the special guests out. We were seated in the room at the entry where those guests continued to mill about, drinks in hand, until 6:25. Conversation was impossible and understanding our waiter virtually impossible. He (Alex) trued his best. Second: the prix fixe menu advertised out front, we were told, was not available on Saturday or Sunday! We were obliged to order a la carte with a less desirable menu. The food, frankly, was a disappointment. Similarly the 225$ wine- but that was our choice. All in all: a disheartening experience, given the high reputation of the establishment.

Dim Sum Bloom is in a convenient location and I’m thankful to have another good Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.  Great food, reasonable prices, great service, quiet and lovely dinning room.  Three of the four dishes we ordered were outstanding.  I wouldn't order the shrimp dumplings again, but the duck rolls, cold noodle, and scallion pancakes were great.  Very solid new wave dim sum; lacks the volume to sustain carts, and lacks variety from visit to visit.  Some very distinctive traditional types of dim sum are just not on their menu.  But the variety they do serve is solid and, surprisingly, the other dishes are even better, and the quantities large.

Have already gotten takeout since our dine in experience. Equally good.  Excellent food, good service, and overall a wonderful, surprising find on the UWS! it’s a little noisy but we had a great time  I wanted to like this place, since it's within walking distance from where I live and they have promotions in terms of points. I do like the food itself, but the quality of service left much to be desired. I had to hail my server down several times and it wasn't because they were busy either. There was hardly anyone there! He also got my dessert order wrong. It took forever to get there and we ran out of time in terms of waiting for the new order to come so I just canceled it. I was still charged for it until I complained. I'm not sure if I'll be coming back. Read more Read more Did not bring all the appetizers.

Read more This is a spacious restaurant and I have enjoyed previous meals both in the place and as takeout.

Their lunch prices are a very good value. However, the lunch staff was quite disorganized in serving our table of 7 people.

The hot and sour soup tasted as though a large dose of salt had accidentally been added. My shredded chicken dish was decent but not as delicious as it had been in previous visits. The included spring rolls were the best part.

I had recommended this place to our group and I was a bit embarrassed when the restaurant failed to deliver.

I might still get occasional takeout. If space was an important factor I would still recommend it. Also, I think maybe their dinner is prepared better, with a better staff, although with higher prices. Read more Excellent courteous service, ample well cooked food

What a great find. Needed a place near Grand Central and I’m so glad I picked Bstro 38. All five of us enjoyed our lunch there. The wine, chowder, salads, tacos and desserts were delicious. The service was fantastic and the decor/atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable.
Looking forward to a return visit. Read more Lovely meal at Bstro 38, food excellent, service good and not too far to walk from mid Manhattan. Great vibe inside. Would def recommend.  Our server was attentive and very helpful with menu choices, even though he was in the weeds. Handling not only a large party upstairs but seated patrons ground level as well. Highly recommend the grilled octopus which is often overcooked elsewhere. The bronzini  was cooked perfectly with very crispy skin and my filet was delicious. I seldom give 5 stars all around, Bistro-38 earned every single one. Absolutely plan to return next time we are in NYC. Read more Nice experience, good food and the service is very good.

I will go once and try more alternatives in NY  Everything was good, from the drinks to the appetizers to the mains to dessert. Will definitely dine here again.  Excellent all around!

Amazing service!!! I definitely would recommend this place.  Loved dinning here! Great ambiance, good, warm service and my Churrasco was cooked perfectly. I would actually come back for this dish alone. So glad we dinned here!  We had such a wonderful time at Bstro 38. Our waiter, Starlin was so lovely and quick to help and come over whenever we needed. Also the bussing staff was so amazing. We never had an empty glass or plate on our table for more than a few seconds. We were also really impressed by the food- calamari, tagliatelle, and mussels were amazing starters! And we also had the short rib which was one of the best I’d ever had! Overall 10/10 experience! They even came over and sang happy birthday and addressed my mom by name while singing without being asked— just mentioned it was her birthday in the reservation notes. We were all wowed! Read more We went to Bistro 38 prior to a show at MSG.  All staff were very gracious.  Service was great - always filling our water glasses and ensuring we didn’t need anything.  We had the branzino and the tagliatelle - both were absolutely delicious.  Great cocktails too - I recommend the spicy mango margarita highly!  We were served expediently without feeling rushed at all.  We will be back - it was great! Read more Good and service were both really good, and the food was excellent.  It was very nice I would recommend this restaurant.  The overall experience was fantastic but our server, Oliver, was outstanding! He was attentive, warm, and very helpful. When ordering a bottle of wine he offered a taste before making a final choice. He recommended dishes that were delicious. The scallop appetizer is one of the best we’ve had. The serving team was also outstanding. We never had to ask for water or new utensils after a course. We look forward to returning soon. Read more Read more By far the best food in the City.

We had mussels, garlic shrimp and burrata. Every dish is fresh and tasty! Will be back. Read more Amazing! From service to the food can not get any better! In such a great location as well!  Overall it's a great place. The decor is so cozy and romantic. The food was delicious. The only issue I had was with the server. We first had a young women who handed us our menus and came to us twice and took out drink order then when we asked for her to order our food we were told by a young man that he was our server now. He stated that she took care of the right side of the room and he the left. That to me was a bit weird. Anyway he was nice and attentive to our needs. Read more I didn't think anywhere could beat New Orleans food (our home town), but the experience we had at Bistro 38 was definitely comparable and maybe better.  Highly recommend.  Had a great time for dinner. Food was served timely and well prepared. The octopus was prepared at the perfect tenderness and the signature dish and entrees were great. Will definitely visit again although there are so many good restaurants in NYC. Read more We tried this restaurant based on Open Table, and we were delighted with our find. I had soft shell crab that was fabulous, my husband a very good pasta with crab, and we shared a terrific burrata salad and a bread pudding that was divine!  I wish we had time to go back.

Excellent vegetarian choices.  Service was absolutely excellent. From the moment we entered the door until we left. Our server told us what the name of the restaurant meant showed us the old map in the restaurant that told us how and where the country was located in Africa the food was amazing. We had the mixed vegan vegetable tray with Lentos mustard greens. It was just amazing, we so enjoyed her conversation and her recommendations on what we should eat. It was perfect. We did not order we ordered just enough food to be tasty. ￼ Read more I hadn't been to the place in over 10 years and went there for my birthday celebration. What a wonderful makeover and the staff was truly amazing and attentive. Really great and one of my best birthdays. Food was really delicious and the FUL was outstanding. 
Great Time! Read more The food was really delicious - we were a party of 7 so we tried a variety of dishes. All except dessert which was pretty mediocre , especially the rum cake and carrot cake which were both dry and chemical tasting. Service was pretty slow but it’s a busy place. Noise level made conversation difficult, will try this restaurant again at a less busy time. Read more Excellent food, great vibe, bar drinks are tasty!!  I've taken my classes at the end of semesters to Massawa and they have never disappointed.

The service, food and atmosphere were inviting and wonderful. We will be back soon!

If you’re not used to Ethiopian food this is a great introduction. The staff was very helpful in explaining the dishes - you can get them mild to spicy. This is a neighborhood spot that is so much more. Read more We went for Valentine's dinner and it was very romantic! The food was incredible and so was the service.  I've been here three times and have had an excellent meal each time.  Read more Wonderful - service, food and feeling are all something special.  Yesterday was my first time dining at Massawa since their renovation (which is very cute!). I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The food was wonderful, my drink refreshing, and the value was amazing . (An app, entree, cocktail, and sparkling water as $41!) and my server, Emnet, put a cherry atop the whole experience. She was kind, knowledgeable, and efficient. I hope to see her next time! Read more The food was delicious. We ordered the vegan sampler and the salmon.  Be patient, though, because everything is prepared to order and, if it's croweded, you'll wait a while.  The waitperson was so lovely and accomodating.
Will definitely return. Read more Some of the most delicious food I’ve had in a while. The staff was so kind.  Dined here for lunch with a friend. Nice, chill ambience. Great for catching up with friends, a date, or business meeting. The server was attentive and kind.

The food was mid. Based on most of the reviews, I expected my tastebuds to have a rave in my mouth but it was more like a book club meeting.

The lentil sambusas were bland. The green sauce definitely helps to enhance the flavor as it was tangy and aromatic.

The veggies in the vegan sampler were also bland! The puréed chickpeas were actually good and I mixed that with the other veggies to give them flavor because the dish was severely lacking.

I enjoyed the injera. It was fluffy and flavorful.

I honestly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to vegans/vegetarians looking for great Ethiopian cuisine. Save your money/energy to go elsewhere. Read more Delicious food and lovely service.  Highly recommend!  Amazing food, service, ambiance, and value! Will return! We’re vegan, Massawa is great for vegans!  Delicious food. Went with my daughter and both loved it  Pros:
1) contactless service - scan QR code at the table; multiple people at the table use the QR ""cube"" select and pay individually.
2) Unique dining experience with an option to eat with hands or utensils.
3) Intimate and cozy with delicious non-alcoholic drink options
4) Options for shared dishes or individual

Cons:
1) Although great ambiance, the place was cold. Could have done with a bit more heat.
2) Certain dishes were expensive (vegan sampler for 2). Mild Salmon Tebsi not as well seasoned as the medium Salmon Tebsi.
3) We placed part of our order with the hostess and part of it on the app/QR code and ended up with an open tab for the hostess. Would have been nice if that showed up on our final bill, to avoid confusion.
4) Plenty street parking Read more We love Massawa! The food is outstanding. The space is loud in general but the tables are fairly spread apart so it's not terrible-but I am
always aware of the noise level.

USDA Prime steaks from the finest Black Angus cattle. Bespoke cocktails. A restored Bank Vault from the 1930s. This is Butcher & Banker, a new ""steakeasy"" at the crossroads of Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Javits Center and Hudson Yards.

Butcher & Banker is no ordinary steakhouse. A dozen different steaks are on offer, but non-steak eaters will dine exceedingly well here.

Butcher & Banker pays homage to the New Yorker Hotel’s storied history. The New Yorker opened in 1930 at the height of the Great Depression as the then largest hotel in the city. It has attracted a who’s who of entertainers and dignitaries from around the world, including Muhammad Ali, JFK, Joan Crawford and Nikola Tesla.

Beneath the hotel, a bank vault and offices were occupied by the Manufacturers Trust Company until 1980. With the opening of Butcher & Banker, the public can see the vault for the first time in 37 years.","Read more Not my favorite place in NY.  They could not even create a simple side salad.  I was told they only have what is on the menu even though they have salads.  Simple lettuce and a few veggies would have been fine but I was told they could not do it. Read more This was a nice and cozy place dine in and have some good drinks, very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, I would come back.  The last time I was here was pre-pandemic. The food, per usual, was delicious. The service was subpar. 7:30 reservation with hardly no one there so not sure why service wasn’t quicker. DONT think I’ll be back any time soon. Read more The restaurant is convenient to MSG and I liked the decor.  Drinks and service were great and we were seated promptly.  The filet mignon was average. While the slab of bacon app was enormous, it was undercooked for how fatty it was.  The chilean sea bass was good/cooked well.  Overall, glad I tried it, but probably won't be back any time soon. Read more The food and service was fabulous! We highly recommend the shrimp cocktail, ribeye and carrots.  Amazing food. Server was attentive and gave great suggestions.  Superb food and ambience. Found servers a little “impatient” kept swarming and I felt rushed. Not how it should be when you are paying $700 for dinner for 4.  We sat at the bar.  One other couple was there.  We waited almost 10 min to be acknowledged.  Once we ordered or drinks we waited another 10 min to get them.    Food was ok.  Clams casino were dry almost inedible.   Would not go back.

The atmosphere was perfect and romantic!! The one and only disappointing thing was that they ran out of the wedge salad early at 6:30  Wonderful experience food was delicious service was perfect drinks were great would definitely come back  Great place for skirt steak frites and drinks, catch a concert at MSG.  I thought the setting was great! We had dinner inside the old bank vault in front of a wall full of old safe deposit boxes, so that was pretty cool. Everything we ordered was good but extremely rich. I thought the wine list was better than average. It’s definitely an old fashioned type of restaurant. Read more A very underwhelming experience in a venue that charges top dollar. It was as if most of the staff had never worked in a restaurant before.  It was a wonderful anniversary dinner before our Broadway show and they really made it extra special with a champagne toast.  The banker bacon, Caesar salad and filet with carrots were all cooked to perfection and deliciously flavorful along with their mouth-watering hand-crafted cocktails.  The portions were nicely sized and the service was top notch.  We will be back!!  I do have to mention a very strange experience though; we were given 2 drinks at dinner, then about 5 minutes later the waiter took them back.  He stated they were supposed to go to some other couple, but that has never happened in all my years of dining.  If you made a mistake, just leave it and apologize but taking it back seemed very class for such a high end establishment.  Overall, it was worth every penny and the food was magnificent. Read more We enjoyed are dinner after a long day of meetings in the city.

We ordered NY strip steak rare and Chilean Sea Bass.

Both were very good, the Sea Bass was slightly over cooked.

Overall it was a good experience.  We ate inside the bank vault. Read more Highly recommended. The food is very good and its ambiance is a different experience. It’s like eating in a high end speak easy.  The overall experience was exceptional. I will recommend it to anyone.  We had randomly picked it for your anniversary dinner after an art show.

The food is very good, but you can find comparable meals all over the city. The waitstaff, the bartenders, the management all work to provide a very pleasant high quality experience. Hector has been there since they reopened and he is flawless. Read more The manager was extremely passively rude. They called about a dress code in advance. When we got there at 630, most people were dressed in jeans and non colored shorts.  The manager took exception to my son’s shorts despite him looking better dressed than most. He then wouldn’t let us sit in main area that everyone else sat in. We sat in the back (and not in the vault) and told my son to hide his legs behind the table so as not to upset the other patrons. HE was dressed in a wrinkled off the rack suit with a dirty shirt. He didn’t even have his jacket on…. The waiters were generally sloppy dressed. I dine around the world. This is a place NOT to go. Food was average at best. Read more We loved this gem. It’s safe to say it was a valuable deposit to our mother/daughter trip. We’ll be locking up the memories of this dining experience for a long time. The food was amazing, the team members were incredible and the ambiance was everything we hoped it would be. Definitely don’t withdraw this restaurant from your NYC to-do list. Read more Food was excellent. Waiter was not friendly and service was not good.  Ambience and food were fantastic.  Bartender was attentive and made good martinis.  Greeter and server didn’t seem to want to be there, but loved the place and will definitely be back.  Our server, Hector, ruined the entire meal. From his inattentiveness to arrogant demeanor, he should be fired.

To sum it up: both my husband and my medium filets were served purple and cold. Hector shined a light and told us that both are actually medium and we were wrong. We had to ask twice to send them back on the grill because he was so argumentative.

I will absolutely never step foot into this restaurant again. I’ve had better service at Applebees & dennys. Do. Not. Eat. Here. Read more My guest and I had an amazing experience.  The service was impeccable.  
I love the sophisticated and relaxed atmosphere at Bankers and Butchers.  It was such a pleasure having drinks and dining there. Read more Service was great! The ambiance was confusing as it was such a cool looking spot. When we went, there were only 4 tables in the restaurant. The noise level was uncomfortably quiet. There was low volumed 50’s diner bops playing which didn’t feel fitting for the style of the restaurant (a red velvet 1930’s bank vault). You could hear every word each table was saying which made my husband and I uncomfortable to talk. The food was fine. Nothing special. My husband and I got the porterhouse for two as our main with the Brussel sprouts and Mac n cheese. The sides were delicious, the steak could’ve used more flavor. The servers were attentive and continuously cleared our plates and silverware between courses. I felt for a place that cared so much about the dress code (they called to remind me two hours before) should have had the ambiance and energy to match. Beautiful restaurant but disappointed in our experience overall. Read more Words are not necessary.  Just eat here!  The food was tremendous.  The atmosphere was beautiful.  The service was spot on.  Although I ate to overflow (couldn't stop eating because it was SO GOOD!) I took the Mascarpone Cheesecake back to the hotel and that was also a hit.  I will definitely go back!

A one of a kind menu and first class service.  Had a very strange experience with the waitstaff. The host came around one time to check on us and the only things he made a point to do were attempt to teach me the ""proper"" way to eat the meal in front of me and rearrange my plates to his liking. He also made a comment about me ""learning what caviar is"" as to insinuate I've never had it or I need to be schooled in fine dining. It felt very pointed and targeted, as I was the only Black diner in the restaurant. He also did not make these comments to my white partner, only directly to me. It was very disappointing and made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed. It was an insult to my intelligence. After this weird interaction, he didn't come back to ask how I was doing, in fact, no one did, not even my server. It is very obvious they felt speaking to us or giving us special attention would've been time wasted. It was meant to be an anniversary dinner and instead ended up being one of the weirdest and most micro-aggressive dining experiences of my entire life. Outside of the service, the dushbara was so flavorless, the broth was essentially water. The borscht was delicious, as was the sea bass and beef wellington. I wanted to leave, so I asked for the check without tea or dessert. It's a shame that was experience was colored by the strange and wrong assumptions of a pompous host.

First time to the Russian Tea Room! Great food and service!  Colossal waste of money!!!  If you want to spend $400 (for 2 people) to sit in a pretty room then this is for you. The afternoon tea was boring sandwiches on stale bread. The scones were good but served with frozen butter and store bought jam (no clotted cream). The pastries were 2 stale mini cupcakes (vanilla/chocolate and red velvet), a chewy (I think frozen) macaron and a mini crème brûlée.

We had no idea this restaurant was tucked in the back of our hotel. I came with my mom and we chose the pre-theatre menu. Everything was amazing from the start. The server was so cool and knew about all the dishes. The Parker house rolls were so amazing, especially with the roasted garlic. The salad portions were huge and so expertly seasoned that I didn’t want mine to end. I had the Apple and endive salad which is now one of my favorite salads I’ve ever had.

A measure of the quality of a restaurant is the people who work there.  Just after we finished dinner my friend suddenly lost consciousness and had a medical emergency.  The staff immediately helped out, called 911 and monitored the situation until we left by ambulance.  Most importantly they kept me calm!  Thank you to the entire staff! Read more I had the pre-fix theatre menu and it was delicious. The service was wonderful, and it was a nice atmosphere. It was not noisy so I could have great conversation.  I definitely would eat here again.  Somewhat overpriced but quite good food in a Hotel restaurant.  My major issue is that they provided the main entree course with no sides. Literally, a burger which costs $18 arrived with no fries or salad. I realized at the end that the sides were extra so fries cost $12 which means you have a $30 burger.  The service was pretty attentive and friendly but the waitress was really keen to remove out plates (which still had food on and we were eating!).  I probably wouldn't return specifically to the location for food which is a shame as the food was really good! No need to skimp out on the sides-come on! Read more It was amazing.

Love the personal attention given to each table and the awesome wait staff. The chorizo croquettes, endive salad and horseradish crusted salmon were some table favorites. The warm rolls with house made garlic butter that was given before the appetizer tasted amazing too. My family was able to eat, relax and make it out of the restaurant in 90 minutes.

Nice upbeat atmosphere with a bar in the front area and more formalized ding in the back. Jordan the manager couldn’t be nicer as he seated us at a cozy booth area.

It has a lux vibe (dark but soft and comforting) and the staff were very friendly and attentive. I went before a Wednesday evening show and was surprised to find it not packed. The menu had a lot of small dishes that I wanted to try (typical girl dinner) and all were delicious. The pickle plate had veggies that I never even thought of pickling (squash? fiddlehead ferns???) and was very good but I could only eat half for fear that any more vinegar would wipe out my palette (it was veryyyy pickled). The shaved ham was exactly what it sounds like and was nice and sugary sweet. The crispy mushrooms were nice and thin and the batter very flavorful. By the time I got to my entree — the pea agnolotti — I could hardly eat anymore, but the pea filling was so refreshing that I managed to eat half (against my better judgment)! Accompanying my meal, I had the watermelon daisy which tasted just like watermelon juice and I could even taste the alcohol — which is exactly what I’m looking for in a beverage!

I was hoping for a memorable experience, given my excellent past visit to Dani Brasserie at the Four Seasons in Madrid.

Unfortunately, the dinner was a complete fiasco. The pork rib paella arrived in an unacceptable state—burnt in places, undercooked in others, and lacking any real flavor. The first red flag came with the ham croquettes, which were served cold. To make matters worse, they tried to take away our tapas three times before we were finished, and there was no host to greet us upon arrival, adding to the disorganization. The service was not only slow but also clumsy and unprofessional.

This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to leave a negative review on OpenTable. What should have been an unforgettable evening was completely ruined, becoming a frustrating waste of time. Deeply disappointing for a restaurant of this stature. Read more Warm service and excellent tapas-style food.  Very interesting drinks  Casa Dani is our favorite restaurant in NYC and we’ve been there many times. This time I have to say we’ve been a bit disappointed. First the menu had had some changes: our favorite dish (pan con tomate with tuna belly) was not anymore on the menu, the tortilla is not the one it used to be, the jamon tray is now iberico and not bellota, the croquetas were quite disappointing.
And finally the dessert (rice pudding) has changed too: the delicious crust has disappeared and on top of that the waiter wasn’t able to finish the dish with the raspberrys and we ate it incomplete.
The sangria (74$ for a jug!) we ordered immediately was served very late during the meal and only because we asked few times.
We’ll be back maybe but unfortunately this time the experience was not good Read more Ordered 8 tapas for 3 people to share and it was perfect. Tasted great  Non existent service waited over an hour for a drink. Service acted like we didn’t exist  Having read some reviews commenting on inconsistent service, we were needlessly worried, as the service staff has clearly responded to the feedback by extra attentiveness to our requests. They well advised us on portion sizes, which avoided a potential overordering situation, as one Paella was really appropriate, given the well advised selection of excellent Tapas. Read more While the food was quite good, the service was absolutely horrible. After arriving I placed a drink order and not soon after we ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. First my drink never came and the waitress came back after food had been delivered to ask me if I wanted to order a drink… I had already given her a drink order that some how slipped her mind completely. Then as the food came out one item never came and one item was incorrect. The waitress then went on to argue with my sister and I that she had written down the right item and that we were incorrect about what we ordered. She also did not write down the croquetas that we ordered and so we never got them. The final straw was after I placed my card down for the check, another staff member came to get it and did charge my card as I could see him do so, but then brings me back the receipt without the merchant or customer copies for me to sign and when I waived down my waitress she goes on to say I have to give her my card first. I told her another staff member took it in her place and brought back without the receipts. She then chased around for the guy who did it and realized I did in fact pay but was right in that he never gave me the receipt to sign. All in all this was the worst service I’ve experienced in a long time. While the food was great, the service makes me never want to return. Read more Great food, front end service was very poor, the meat platter was a mistake  Over priced and food terrible service was very sllow  The restaurant has a lovely look, the color palette is very soothing, one feels  at ease, chill, very laid back. Upon entering, I was greeted by the host and seated immediately, even though I was the first to arrive in my party. We were 5 and tried the tasting menu without the wine pairing. As far as the food; starting with the crudo, this was by far the best part of our meal, the croquettes and ceasar salad were algo very good. We  tried two paellas, mariscos and short rib. The mariscos paella was very salty and I believe it was overcooked, not in the way that paella is supposed to be, crunchy rice, etc. , but the seafood itself was put in to fast thus making the seafood dry and tough. The second paella was better rice was crunchy, a little burnt, but I like this, and the ribs were tender, although way to much seasoning, which took away from the taste of the meat. We also had two desserts, the pineapple and the rice pudding, the pineapple was ok, the rice pudding was not great, it was too runny, long grain rice was used, not valencia rice, and it was not even sweet. Overall, I was expecting an amazing gastronomic experience but at best it was ok. Would go back just for the crudo and croquettes. Read more Read more Everything was fabulous. Only thing I would've liked is for a little something since I made a note stating it was our 10th wedding anniversary. Not a song and dance but maybe a small dessert would've been nice since we could've gone anywhere but chose this restaurant. Read more Our expecting Paella was unfortunately not hot enough and lacking of a good balance between cost and quality. The plates and glasses were beautiful and the interior was fantastic.  Beautiful place in a nice location, food is fine (paellas probably the best they have in the menu. Wine selection is a little bit short in comparison with such an elegant location. I’d recommend the experience though. Read more It’s always a great place to be special if you’re at the bar service fantastic  The entire staff went beyond to take care of our large party. What a treat. Highly recommended.  We ordered the tasting menu. The first dish was tuna and guacamole.  It did not seem Spanish-inspired. The metal stand it was served on was perhaps 12"" high- like the stand one would use for a seafood  e.g. oysters plate.  Much too high. The paella was cold, much too large a portion, and no soccrat. The dessert of pineapple and some kind of sauce tasted great but should have been in another type of dish. It was too deep. The lighting at night could be a little lower. Read more Second time dining here and regrettably, not as good as the first time. The food was good, but the service was way off mark. Our waiter kept pushing us to order entrees in a manner only seen at a fast food joint.  What’s happened here?!  I’d like to also add that the wine list is now a minuscule version of the original.  Apparently the restaurant has changed ownership. I hope the new ownership takes stock of this place and reinvigorates it. Read more Very nice place. The food wasn’t extremely exciting but it was delicious.
Service is fantastic.  Horrible service and the rice was not cooked- when we mentioned this we were told our rice is crunchy—  Service was not particularly welcoming at all, each time our server arrived at the table, he stared before saying anything. We also got sat in the far back corner when nearly everybody else was sat in the main dining room for some reason while there were many unseated tables on this regular Wednesday evening. Food was definitely good but nothing extraordinary especially for the price but I suppose that can be accounted for in the curation of quality ingredients. The highlight of this restaurant is its interior architecture (save the oddly paired music); if only we were sat somewhere where we could better take in the architecture. Read more Read more We have been at Casa Dani countless times, and always was a great experience, unfortunately looks like this is going to be a “used to” place.
Croquetas used to be the best in NY, now are meh at best
Pan con tomate and tuna belly used to be one of the best appetizers, now they are little sponges soaked on tomato liquid that kills the tuna flavor.
They used to have a great wine list that no only is now limited to 3-4 options (they have more french selections than Spanish, hello? Is this a Spanish restaurant?) but also way overprice ($100 for a $20 bottle)
The service used to be great, yesterday it was the worst service we have had ever, and oh! When they bring the check the bring it with 20,22 and 25%
in all fairness the paellas are still great and the oxtail brioche always on point, but unfortunately looks like they just gave up and are only interested in one time tourist guests.
😞 Read more Our server was great, the sommelier made a wonderful recommendation on a bottle of wine... When we ordered a second bottle, he came by the table and removed the bottle and decanter (which still had some wine in it) and whisked it away before we could say anything and brought the decanter back full with the new empty wine bottle. I quietly mentioned to  the sommelier that it was very unusual to remove the decanter with wine still in it and to not let us taste the new wine before decanting it etc and it was met with a dismissive attitude. For all I know the wine could have been swapped for a cheaper bottle and decanted with the original wine bottle brought back. I tasted it and don't think that was the case. I've never experienced that from a restaurant let alone a knowledgeable sommelier before. The fact that an apology wasn't given was disappointing.

The food was fine but didn't blow us away given the mostly positive reviews we had read. The seafood paella wasn't good so we didn't eat it and our wonderful server took it off the bill and brought out some complimentary desserts which was appreciated. Read more We were told preparation of whole fish might take 20 - we said fine.  We weren’t served for least 45 minutes and when we were, the fish was room temperature.

Though the food is terrible, the service is an insult.  Great service and excellent tapas, amazing space as well  Food was good, although very overpriced for what it was.  Service was terrible. The servers were all nice and competent, but there were not enough of them, and there didn't seem to be a single server assigned to our table.

Looking forward to going back.  Wonderful tonnarelli cacio pepe, as hoped. Great bartender makes bar seating a preferred option, however the large TV screen is a bit assertive and out of place.  I always enjoy dining at Cacio e Pepe Uptown.  Salvatore is a master of blending flavors that are unique and wonderful.  Tonight I had the ricotta ravioli which sounds commonplace.  But the rabbit ragu and roasted mortadella made it very special - it was wonderful.  I tasted the seafood risotto that was very creamy and filled with seafood that was cooked just right.  I usually have the Insalata  10, 20, 30 which is always fresh and delicious and a great way to start a meal.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisù which is like no other tiramisù I've ever tasted.  There is an Amaretto ""tiramisù"", seems like an Amaretto pudding, with apricot sauce on the side, and a cup of espresso granita which was fabulous and a great addition to the rest of the dessert.

The noise level varied depending on the ambulances and fire trucks. 😏  I wanted a good burger and, wow, did I get one. Added Applewood smoked bacon and cheese. It was cooked to perfection!!! The service was just lovely.  It happened to be a very crowded Saturday evening. It took over 55 minutes to receive our main course.

The server was inattentive.  It was just ok. Chaotic when we arrived as there are 2 entrances and people came in from all directions. No where to wait properly which when there are 30+ people it’s a bit awkward.

Le dije sunny side por elegir alguno. Para mi sorpresa llegaron 2 huevos sunny side encima de un pan sin salsa ni absolutamente nada!
Pregunté a otro bartender y me respondió que si quería salsa me la traerían sin ningún costo adicional! En ese momento llegó el otro camarero diciendo que así son los huevos Benedictinos. Ya se imaginan mi incomodidad, ni lo probé y pedí la cuenta, sin ni siquiera preguntar si había pasado algo? Me cobraron. Una experiencia decepcionante!

Food was nothing special.  Save your money and avoid this scam of a restaurant. Zero love in the food here - nothing tasted fresh and they should be ashamed at what they call pastrami. It definitely was not made in house and tasted frozen. No possible way that was wagyu beef like the menu says. Boars Head from Sysco at best.

Went for brunch, my wife had the Omlette, I had the Eggs Benedict. If you go, make sure you make a reservation. The best thing was how quickly we were seated. My wife enjoyed her omlette but my eggs Benedict were super disapointing. The English muffin was hard, the eggs were overdone, and there was one sliver of ham which couldn’t even cover an English muffin round per half. I say ham because to call it “Canadian Bacon” is an affront to both Canadians and Bacon.

When we visit NYC, we love Ocean Prime, his crown jewel and one of our favorite places in NYC too! Fabulous food, great service, as always! Read more Two women dining dilemma … We were ushered to an adequate, but crowded table on a side of the dining room where other women clientele were also ushered. The island of women diners. Directly opposite from a roomy table which consisted of a lone male diner.

The food was quite good and our compliments to the chef. Our waiter, however, was rushing us to leave and kept bucking for a review. This behavior tainted the entire dining experience. I doubt a return visit will happen. Read more Ridiculously expensive, mediocre food. We expected a lot more.  When we want an excellent seafood dinner, this is where we come. Consistently excellent food and service. Not much more to say than that.  As always, our meals were delicious and the service was impeccable. You must try the truffle deviled eggs.  Great to see Alexa again.
Great food, service and ambience.  OP-NYC is the designated gathering spot for our little group. Last nite we celebrated my birthday and our brother Ryan. As always, it was a wonderful evening!! We even got to meet Chef who showed us “Truffle Love” for the incredible Halibut Special!! #Chef’sKiss
Phenomenal food. Kind, attentive staff who always treat us as though we are family coming home, great ambiance. Special thanks and shout-out to our awesome server Nacer who always makes sure our experience is amazing - he always, ALWAYS takes amazing care of us. Thank you Nacer!!!
Grateful to the entire OP-NYC team for always making our visits truly awesome and memorable. See you soon!
Lisa, Odell, Ryan, Keline, Gebrina Read more Read more Great food and service!!! Had a business dinner and everything was excellent! From sushi to steak to lobster tails to sides to desserts. Enjoy! Great restaurant  Had a memorable experience, everyone was just at the top of there game. Service,food, drinks everything just wonderful.  They were able to increase the number on our reservation, which was great. Excellent business dinner, and a lot of fun. Very good waiter.  Perfect NYC meal. Best manhattan  I have ever had. The rosemary grapefruit peppercorn bitters put it over the top.  We started with the Calamari which was very good. I like the tentacles and there were plenty of them, however, my GF is not as much into them. She had the prime rib which she found delightful. I tasted it and approve it.  I had the Chilean Sea bass which came on a bed of potato puree, with broccolini and truffles in it. This was an amazing dish. There was also a grouper that looked good and some interesting items. We did not make it to dessert had two rounds of wine.. This is our second time there. First time we had the prix fixe menu which is more cost-effective but limits what you can order. This was indeed pricy but the food was excellent. Read more Service was perfect. We celebrated my birthday and the staff, especially Gordon, made it a special experience. The food was excellent as always and I stuck with my faves, the blackened snapper and the jalapeño au gratin, while my wife had the juicy and flavorful filet mignon and my daughter the kids cheeseburger. For dessert we went with the chocolate cake that was topped with birthday decorations. Overall it was a great pick for my birthday and I highly recommend Ocesn Prime. Read more Must visit place in Tribeca. From service to food and the ambience, everything is excellent. The breakfast options were amazing, make sure to try the croque monsieur.  Our sever, Jesus, made our evening very special and memorable! He was knowledgeable and attentive. 
The food was amazing and surprising. The flavors of my snapper with spoon cornbread and corn emulsion with a touch of lemon, exploded in my mouth! It was a delightful  dinner I will never forget. Read more Our meal was great. Chilean sea bass. And the best desserts. Chocolate torte and butter cake. We highly recommend Ocean Prime for dinner. 
Our entire experience was welcoming from when we arrived to our server, Myles, who was super nice and professional, as well. And their manager was quietly supervising the entire restaurant. (Which should be impressive to his employer) Read more We ordered the seafood tower. The price was not listed on the menu. We assumed the price would be in line with other NY high end restaurants, around $200. They charged a la carte prices for each item on the tower for a total of $340. The seafood was good but the price was way out of line. After pointing this out in a review the restaurant got in contact and offered a gift certificate to bring the total in line with comparable restaurants- they clearly care about making customers happy (and avoiding bad reviews). They say that in the future they will make the price of the seafood tower clear to diners up front- hopefully they will follow through on that. Read more Read more The place is very handsome and the service was very professional.  The shrimp cocktail was especially fresh and tasty.  But the blackened snapper was dry and a bit flaky. For a restaurant with these high prices, I expected more refined cooking. Read more Excellent all around service and food.  Would highly recommend!  Very nice restaurant, food was great, service and the people working there are fantastic  Our server was engaged and friendly but did not interfere with our experience! It was a perfect blend! The Chilean Sea bass melted in your mouth!  Outstanding. The red snapper was melt in your mouththe salmon perfectly cooked. Great service will go again  The bar runs very well because of Kristina and Alton  We sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party and both bartenders were friendly and very hospitable. After we were seated our waiter, Jesus, was enthusiastic, helpful and accommodating. The food was delicious with appropriate portions and great flavors. Everything from the appetizers to dessert had a nice presentation as well. This was a great choice for a family occasion. Read more Our dining experience was exceptional. The food was outstanding and the service was even better. Jesus was incredible! We will definitely be back during our next NYC visit!  Fabulous service. Amazing food. We ordered from the theatre menu.  Everyone at Ocean Prime outdid themselves! From the hostess who sat us to the waitstaff that all stopped by to wish us well to Gordon who served us...outstanding!!  The food was amazing! Everything was done perfectly!  They accommodated all of our wishes and more!!

We were greeted warmly by the host and taken through a curtain to a large and interesting dining space that is very inviting and a little mysterious.  Service was engaged and polite.  Wine list is comprehensive and fairly priced with some good bargains (relatively speaking).  The cheese puffs were a little bit heavy but tasty.  The tarte flambé was tasty but more like a flatbread than a tarte, which was surprising given the chef’s French pedigree (at least as explained by the waiter).  The trout and beef tartare were very good. The shrimp bucatini was ok.  The Apple tart tatin was a nice way to finish.  It was a quiet night so we sat for a while an enjoyed the atmosphere.

Loved it!  Food is amazing, it’s a seasonal menu, drinks are really good too. It gets busy and there’s a little bit of a waiting time for food but overall service was good.  GORGEOUS space and very nice service but skip the starters. The bread basket was DELICIOUS (warm sourdough!) and my espresso martini was EXCEPTIONAL!  The pasta in the bucatini was lovely, but the starters were pricey and not great. We got three dips (I didn't try the eggplant but the other two tasted like ketchup and sour cream), the salmon pate smelled like hot dogs and the tuna was fine but nothing special at $28.

Read more Delicious dinner and dessert, beautiful open space with lots of natural light, attentive and friendly service!  Terrible. The menu was minimal, to say the least. Ordered the Charcuterie board. What came were two serving boards of lunch meats, no bread, no cheeses, no accompaniments (i.e. jams, veggies, or fruits). If you're just delivering a tray of meat, don't call it a Charcuterie board. The red snapper was dry, and the duck was cold when it arrived.

The lighting was so lovely and the ambience was perfect for a girls dinner 💞 also came during restaurant fest!! 29$ for a two course meal!  Food was okay, service was awful. It’s beautiful and very aesthetic but not worth it  This place used to be good.

Like almost every other restaurant in NYC, overhyped, overpriced, for small portion below average food.

The menu is paired down to basic cafeteria selection, probably done better in an Italian elementary school.

Thank you  As always, my experience at Empire Steak House was phenomenal!!  I always look forward to the great food and stellar customer service.  Wonderful old school room.  Diverse menu with of course beef being the star.  Amazing food, best crab cakes ever. The ribs were fantastic.  The staff couldn't do enough for you. We went to celebrate our friends engagement, staff made it a night to remember.  Great atmosphere, fantastic service. Good food and perfectly cooked.  I love a great New York steak house and this was my first visit to the Empire Steak House East - and it sure won't be my last. Firstly the wonderful staff welcomes you from the moment you walk in the door. Everyone was so polite and friendly and really wanted you to have a great experience. The restaurant is very unique and unusual as it is an old dinner theater. It is a large room with a high ceiling. The wall of wine racks are where the stage used to be. It has a massive chandelier in the center and we sat at a large banquette table along the side. We were visited by several waitstaff and the manager stopped at our table after every stage of the meal to be sure we were happy with the service. The food was outstanding. Great craft cocktails, Caesar salad and lump crabmeat cocktail with large lumps of crabmeat. Delicious. And we had filet mignons that were cooked exactly as we requested and were tender and delicious. The sides of home fries sautéed asparagus and creamed spinach were excellent. And freshly made tiramisu for dessert. This was a great meal and the best service I've had in a long time. We can give them - all of them - our highest recommendation. And I cant wait to go back for another memorable meal. Thanks for making it an outstanding birthday dinner for my wife.

I came for the restaurant week menu and found that to be a great deal! I was impressed with the vibe of the restaurant and the atmosphere. When I walked in, the two bartenders looked at me and ignored me. I tried to find the host stand and no one was there. Finally got the manager to greet me and seat me at the bar. The two bartenders were not friendly at first. It felt like they were just going through the motions of being there. I finally got one of them to talk and she seemed quite friendly and I wanted to know more about her. The food came out reasonably timed, but the steak was overcooked. It was a solid medium when I ordered medium rare. The portion was great for the restaurant week price, I was not about to send it back. They ran out of the after dinner drink I ordered while they were pouring mine, they were kind enough to give me the beverage that was available but they didn’t have a back up bottle to finish the pour. I do appreciate the gift! Overall I thought my experience was fine. Based on this one experience, I wouldn’t come back for a full priced menu but I would definitely recommend it for the restaurant week menu! Read more Good Food and Great Experience

The food choice was really good and came super well prepared and was delicious - we sent back three empty plates after each course.

Always good. Never disappointed at Westville. The Market Plate is the best! Great crispy eggplant app and chorizo enchiladas. Everyone was happy! Great service too.  If you like tasty entrées with lots of vegetable choices, Westville is for you. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and I chose the Brussels Sprouts with roasted carrots, which were delicious.

The Kale salad was fantastic and huge. Great happy hour too. Also great service.   Salmon with two market veggies may seem as standard as it comes but at Westville it’s on a whole other level.

Favorites are eggplant appetizer, watermelon salad, Brussels sprouts, beets, kale & apple pie yum! Read more Delicious lunch!

Je recommande.  Although the front of the restaurant is vibrant and inviting there is a back room which felt like being relegated to the kids table at a family holiday dinner.  We were brought to the rear room, immediately we asked to be seated up front upon seeing the diiference, the host refused stating nothing was available (although we had just passsed several empty tables).  The food was great although the service was poor.  The appetizers and entrees all came at once- obviously we were not welcome.  We left as fast as we could.

They were lovely and attentive, and they made my mother-in-law's birthday a sweet experience for her and her husband.  We chose the tasting menu, hoping for an interesting experience.  The food was fine, but nothing particularly interesting.  The bronzino was slightly overcooked.   They forgot to make the dessert, which they said was on the menu, until I reminded them.  Then they put a candle in the chocolate dessert as promised.  Several of our guests had multiple cocktails and wine, so I know that accounts for some of the price of the bill.

Excellent service
We really enjoyed the dinner  Exceptional food in all menus from brunch to dinner. Have eaten there more than a handful of times and food never disappointed.

Read more Very nicely prepared dishes, rich flavors, nice wines. Staff was very attentive.  My 1st time for dinner & it was delicious!! Really nice menu & choices. Good value & excellent service. I will definitely be going back again.  The food here is great! This time I was a solo diner so appreciated sitting at the bar to enjoy my meal. I have dined previously with friends and family. Really delightful menu.  A delightful experience for my whole family!

Great Mediterranean cuisine - outstanding mezze and skewers selection! Pomegranate salmon was the runaway winner on taste and presentation, but spicy feta and roasted eggplant were close behind! Read more Already proven to be the best restaurant in the 57th street corridor, Acadia ventured out into holiday specialties and did Rosh Hashona tonight with some Israeli dishes. They were great, and the service crew remains the most informed and yet fun in the hood Read more Phenomenal experience from A-to-Z. This restaurant is by far the best restaurant in this neighborhood. We loved everything we had and felt truly cared for by the staff. Unlike the other restaurants in the area that love to give you surly service. This place is different and worth your reservation to dine here.
Standouts are the  cocktails – namely, the outstanding gin and tonic filled with botanicals, citrus juices, and rosemary -as well as the ravioli appetizer filled with shiitake mushrooms and leeks, and the outrageously delicious crispy duck entrée. Our lovely waitress Clara suggested an over the top delicious dessert – I don't know what it's called, but it was ice cream with all kinds of beautiful frothy creamy toppings, and crunchy accents.
My only complaint was at the noise level was outrageously high. :(. It started out manageable and quiet when we were at the bar, but it turned out to be frustrating that I had to yell at my husband who was just 30 inches away from me by the time our apps arrived at 7:00. In fact, Everybody was yelling at their partners to be heard!! So my suggestion is to the management – please, please, please turn DOWN the volume on your music- as the happy atmosphere and joy of your own customers can fill in the blanks without having to torture us with music that does not complement our experience. Your restaurant is so beautiful and welcoming, the lighting soft and sexy, the artwork extraordinary, and the food and super talented chef worth a James Beard award that you don't need really loud music to add anything negative to our experience.
But other than that, I give this place a 99% Perfection award and thank everyone from the hostess to the Somaliere for making our night truly special. We can't wait to return because this will be our go-to Restaurant every time we come to New York! Bravo to all!!!

The roasted potatoes that came with the main courses are outstanding.  Some of the food was great; some was average.  Bread and salad good. Crispy lamb entree excellent.  Salmon skewer average.

My only negative is that’s it’s very noisy.  Awesome overall experience!  Food, drinks and superb service.   The seasoning, preparation and presentation are spectacular:)  Hummus was great, but they messed up my drink order twice and the salmon portion was minuscule for $35. Very strange.  Good ambience.

Good Brunch experience with a selection of sandwiches and salad. Could have had a more attentive service level, had to keep waving our service staff to get him to attend to our needs!

We were not feeling rushed as we had on our first visit. Read more Server and service were excellent with a very attentive sommelier and a lovely bottle of wine.  Unfortunate it ended there. The food was average at best and we ordered a wide variety of things.  The table next to us was super rambunctious ( can’t blame the restaurant) and we could not hear each other talk. Price point about right for area but because the food was meh, poor value at best.  Won’t got back anytime soon. Read more Noise and music level much too high. We could not have a table conversation without shouting!  This relatively new restaurant was exceptional. The food was delicious, servers and staff gracious and knowledgeable as well as appropriately attentive.  The team (especially Alexa) was absolutely LOVELY from start to finish. Will definitely be back.  The atmosphere is what you expect at a terrific Mediterranean restaurant.

All throughout our meal, we never felt rushed nor had to ask for extra water; it was always brought promptly by the staff. They were accommodating, and our server was Mynor.

Food was relatively good. Parker house rolls fresh and delicious. Kids menu perfect for the 4th and 6th grader. Chicken Milanese and swordfish pretty good. Sizable portions. Caprese pretty good.

Drinks were a real disappointment and recommend you stick with water. $21 for half a cocktail that almost looked like a mistake, but we were too polite to say anything.

Staff didn’t let us sit when we arrived (one person was late and they can’t seat partial tables - we had 4 out of 5 people there), so we waited outside with tired kids while our table sat empty. At first I thought it was ok as many places can do this (though usually for smaller groups and not with kids).

When we came back 15 mins later to sit down, without the missing person, I realized we were the last seating at the table, so there was reason we needed to wait. (we were not holding up the table.)

This is probably just lack of staff training. So the place has potential. They should do a bit of training, address the drinks issue, and one small note I forgot about was that the bar area (as you enter the restaurant) was dirty (plastic water bottle and trash on the floor). With out of town guests it was a bit embarrassing to be honest.

Starting with the Empanadas de Pollo, a perfect balance of flaky pastry and braised all-natural chicken, each bite was a delightful mix of warmth and savory goodness. The Pollo Campestre, slow-roasted in a hearty wine reduction with potatoes and carrots, provided comforting, homestyle flavors, while the Pollo Manigua, Cuban adobo roasted chicken breast served with sweet potato purée and a fresh watercress salad, was tender and flavorful, elevated by the mojo vinaigrette.

The Fried Sweet Plantains were the ideal side, sweet and perfectly caramelized.

The servers know the menu intimately. Our waiter knew just what to bring us each after we told him my favorite flavors. He didn’t even have to look at the menu once when making perfect choices for us. Also, wow! Great wine list! No skimping on good quality here!

Read more I like this restaurant a lot.  The food is delicious, the ambience is charming and the staff are very attentive.  The price is reasonable given the high quality.

My only objection is the price of the wine.  I dine out all the time and always have wine so I know what things should cost.  The wine, which was good, not great, was more than $20/glass, which is unreasonable.

Read more As always, the food was delicious and the service friendly and helpful.  I was, however, disappointed with the portion size of the veal in the veal picatta special.  A great restaurant for a big group. They make three different sized pizzas and the medium and large are both excellent for a bunch of people to share. All delicious!!!  this isn’t really good, I think they’re paying for reviews. Bread was 3 days old. Lasagna is sweet for some off reason, the only thing edible was the pizza which in my opinion, how badly can you ruin it? Someone said this was a hidden gem, and I’m convinced they live under a rock Read more Really amazing pizza and the sorbetto was beautifully presented!  Excellent pizza especially for a large group! If you order the family size it is very fun for sharing.  Pizza was amazing. A little overpriced but it is NYC.  Great experience dining there with a large group! Staff was attentive and super helpful  Artichoke appetizer was amazing and perfect when combined with a salad for lunch.  Super quiet during a midday lunch - definitely a neighborhood feel.  Just what I was looking for.  We had a very nice time at Numero 28 yesterday, their outdoor seating is very pleasant and nicely decorated. I had the tuna tartare appetizer and the branzino which was delicious. My husband had the meatballs, which rapidly disappeared, so I think they were pretty good. My daughter loved her margherita pizza. Read more Read more Every once in awhile you find a little gem. This is one of them. They serve authentic pastas as you would have in Florence and Milan. Cooked al dente, as it should be, with unique sauces. They are a treat. I did not have pizza which was doing a brisk business.

If you are not full, try the mini cannolis. You do not have that perfect filling in 99% of Italian restaurants in NYC. Friendly knowledgeable staff.

Read more I came back after a while and unfortunately this place is not as good as it used to be. The food was meh as well as the service. Our server started off strong and then disappeared for the rest of the night, I didn’t even get to order a second glass of wine and he never checked in to see if everything was ok with our food. We even had to request dessert menus and the check from other staff members. The chicken Milanese had a weird texture, the menu said it was chicken breast but the texture did not look like it. The pizza was fine but I think it used to be better. Read more Thanks to Alessandro for a beautiful food and if you are a fan of it, ask for the pasta carbonara! I’m pretty sure I never ate a better one  Party of 12, there was a back room that was absolutely perfect. The staff was amazing, very accommodating.

We chose this place bc of the menu we read online.  However the menu they handed out was missing a lot of items on the online menu.  However having said that, we asked for 2 items that were not in the menu they handed out but the online menu. They were able to make them.  Which was great.   But they should really make sure online menu and handed out menu is almost the same.

2 dishes came out extremely salty.  We did not mention this, we just dealt with it.

What made our night excellent at this was place was the ambience, the room, the SERVICE we received.

Despite the menu issue and the salty dishes, we would go back again Read more Excellent restaurant with good meals.

The French Onion soup was just as excellent.  Very good steak house, will go back for sure. It’s not one of these giant places with hundreds of tables so you get personalized service. We had the Kobe steak and it was excellent. They do need to update the online menu as they have changed from kosher steaks to Halal steaks also available in addition to regular steaks. The tuna crudo was excellent, the onion soup good and thick. Read more Let me start by saying that the service was wonderful. From the moment I sat down, it was clear that the manager was doing it all—bartending, serving and handling everything else at the beginning of the evening. I appreciated the hustle.

I was really looking forward to a quality steak dinner before catching the Acela and my order included half a dozen oysters, a Wagyu ribeye (which was listed as halal) and potatoes au gratin.

The oysters were fine, nothing too remarkable but the potatoes were the highlight of the meal—creamy, flavorful, and perfectly done.

Unfortunately, the ribeye was underwhelming. It lacked the rich flavor I expect from Wagyu and honestly, it tasted more like a lower quality choice cut. I’ve had steak from all regions and this just didn’t meet the standard. I’m not sure if the halal preparation had something to do with it but in my opinion, this shouldn’t be marketed as Wagyu.

Maybe it was an off day for the kitchen, especially given the positive reviews I’ve read but overall, the steak didn’t deliver. Read more This was our first time here and it did not disappoint. The food was so delicious and cooked exactly the way wanted it. Our server was so nice and attentive.

The quality of the meat has gone down significantly over the last few years. Makes me wonder if that is why they're doing the 50% off any steak promotion. Service is worse too. Inexperienced waiters. I asked for a Gin Gibson at the bar and he brought a totally different drink then shrugged his shoulders and said ""I dunno, this is what the bartender put out."" 212 Steakhouse is no longer in the same league as other NYC heavyweights.

Will return soon  Fantastic food. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend!  We went for our anniversary, before we went to see a show. The service was incredible, they made it a very special night for us!  I recently dined at this fantastic Italian spot in NYC, and it exceeded all my expectations! The highlight of the meal was the chicken parm pizza—it was simply divine. The crispy, perfectly seasoned chicken combined with the rich marinara and melted cheese made every bite a delight.

To complement the pizza, I tried their mezcal cocktail, which was expertly crafted. The smoky flavor paired beautifully with the meal, adding a unique twist to the experience.

Couldn’t come close to finishing it. Sadly forgot the to-go bag in the restaurant.  Will definitely return. Read more Well, from the get-go, let me say that the quality and taste of the food, seating on time and the courtesy and efficiency of the server was on par. However, when the manager happened to walk by my table, I spoke with him about an ongoing problem. He was condescending, which really was a surprise, considering this restaurant's reputation.

We had this reservation for nearly two months and we were very much looking forward to the evening. After about 25 minutes into our meal and at the start of eating our entrée, the restaurant had to set up 5 consecutive tables to accommodate approximately 20 arriving guests. I certainly understand their need to set up for any reservation, but they did it like the Three Stooges. They kept rolling in tables and banging tables and moving chairs, back and forth and all around. After about 10 minutes worth of this during our meal, a man, who identified himself as the manager, walked by and I said to him that the noise and commotion was very disruptive. Instead of simply saying that he was sorry or any type of apology or acknowledgement whatsoever, his response was ""We're a very busy turnover restaurant.""

I said ""There's no need to be defensive, all I was saying to you was that it was very disruptive and it took much longer than it should have taken and was much noisier because the 4 staff members kept making mistakes.

Obviously, this exchange ruined the ambience overall for us and soured our opinion of the restaurant. For a manager to act defensively and not acknowledge the reality of the situation, I suspect the owners will not be very pleased with the choice he made with his response and attitude towards a customer   At least I hope not. Let's see if they respond. Stay tuned!

I would also suggest having the Hojicha Ice cream at the end as it is just simply unique and delicious! I will go again for sure and also try their Kaseiki restaurant next door.

Highly recommended and will go again.  Meat was cold we asked for food to come whenever it was ready but every dish came together and it took a while.. server was kind but i think she didn't listen carefully when we ordered. Eel was good but for the quantity quite expensive just $70 for one bowl of eel.. Read more Outstanding! Great food, kind service, delivered every time.  Kawabun is excellent. It's housed in what used to be Kajitsu. A waft of incense greets you upon arrival and transports you to Japan. Climb the stairs to an elegant, understated room with hanging Noguchi lamps.  The noise level is low, so you can have a great conversation. The tempura moriawase set at lunch is a deal at $28. Don't skip the desserts: the sake miso ice cream is exotic; the refreshing yuzu sorbet was the perfect antidote to a hot day. Service is thoughtful. Read more Food was okay. I had high expectations going into the meal, but none of the dishes I tried blew me away. I ordered the spicy tuna over crispy rice special, and the rice was so overcooked that it felt like biting into peanut brittle.

Opened in 1946 in the heart of the Principality of Monaco, nowadays Rampoldi is an institution and a symbol of Monte Carlo. Over the years it became a place where local and international celebrities meet, so the restaurant decided to widen its brand overseas in the city of the American dream, New York.
Label of luxury, class, and sophistication all over the world, Rampoldi spreads the Monegasque way of life and the peaceful elegance of the Côte d’Azur: the inheritance of what embodies the soul of Monte Carlo from more than seven decades opens to future and new challenges.","Read more While the food is consistently good and the waiters well-trained and friendly, the rest of the service staff is untrained.  At least 6 times two different people removing plates and flatware from tables refilled our water glasses but did not removed our finished plates, glasses or used flatware.  This happened throughout dinner from start to finish.  These same people ( not the waiter) stood around staring at the walls or talking to each other when the table needed to be cleared of items.  Often a single item was removed and other finished items were left. There is no excuse for such poor service.

The most unexpected mishap came with dessert when my dining partner ordered two types of gelato to taste - they were brought in separate dishes, which was ridiculous- who does not understand that the two ""scoops"" should be served on the same dish or in the same bowl? He was embarrassed.

The waiter was great but he wasn't minding the service at our table and the restaurant was 90% empty at 8-9:30 pm on a Saturday night. So while he understood all the proper protocol of waitering, he exercised no supervision of our table. Read more Our reservation was at 9 and by 9:30 staff were cleaning the restaurant around us. Very unprofessional. We got our food to go and left.  We went for pre-theater dinner, but the service was so bad that we had to leave before our entrees arrived.  Although we had allowed an hour and a half for dinner, had ordered the pre-theater dinner, and had informed the restaurant of our timing, an hour and fifteen minutes after our arrival our entrees had not yet been served (despite my efforts to get the  attention of staff members), and there was no indication that their arrival was imminent.  Even if the entrees had arrived then, there would have been insufficient time to consume them, and no time for the desert included in the price of the pre-theater dinner. There didn’t seem to be anyone in charge or anyone who cared about us, and we were ignored even as we were leaving. The appetizers that were served after we had been in the restaurant for almost an hour were very ordinary. Read more Mediocre to awful food for exorbitant prices in a loud and ugly 1960-style room. Wine offerings were boondoggles, too. The only redeeming feature was our waiter, who was great. We certainly won’t be back. Read more The Open Table app indicates that the three course prix fixe menu is available at all times before 6:30, but it is not available at lunch.  There is something reassuringly luxe  and maybe, louche, about Rampoldi, without being stuffy or formal.  The food is consistently excellent, and conversation is easy.  Of course its location is excellent for all things Lincoln Center. Read more Second visit six months later- food and ambience are still very good- probably needs a bit more sophistication with desserts. Staff mostly quite attentive- but in one case charmingly unpolished. “You Guys” ? Still glad to be here because the low noise facilitates the conversation. Most other places have deafening noise.

The restaurat itself is very pretty Read more I had anticipated eating here before we went to the Met Opera. We were seated promptly and our waiter came and introduced himself. The cocktails arrived and were served to the wrong person. The fresh burrata and pears was nice. The shrimp cocktail had large but overcooked shrimp. The Beef Tartare prepared table side was a nice presentation. However, the tartare was bland and lacked seasoning and acid. We waited quite a while with our finished plates and cocktail glasses on the table. The table next to us was bussed/crumbed. I finally flagged down our waiter to order the bottle of wine for our main course. He brought the wine and presented it for approval he then disappeared and returned with the bottle open but did not present the cork. I can only surmise that he must have not had a wine key on his person when he brought the wine to the table. Our main course arrived and the dirty plates from the first course were still on the table and had to be hurriedly bussed while we waited for the Dover Sole to be filleted table side. The crab ravioli was also waiting (and getting cold) for our table to be cleared. While  preparing our fish table side, the waiter tore and folded the fillets . He grabbed a napkin from a neighboring table to wipe the rather messy plate. The fish was sauced at presentation but the sauce was broken and needed acid. The waiter failed to refill our wine glasses prior to leaving. The pomme purée that came with the fish was extraordinarily bland and needed salt and pepper. The cauliflower gratin was the best park of the main course. The grilled asparagus was cold when it was placed on the table at the same time as our main course. When we brought this to our waiter’s attention he simply removed it without offering a remedy. With desert, They even tried to deliver my espresso to the wrong table.  With a visible pastry chef we had wanted more. I could go on and on. The service was rather disappointing. I would not waste my time or money here again. Read more Very nice atmosphere ruined by poor and inattentive service by uneducated wait staff; and very average food.  Utter disappointment.  Food  excellent. Service poor  all need training! Ambience beautiful and very elegant.  An outstanding space with a classy atmosphere and a varied menu in a prime location. The price of the dishes is high considering most the menu offerings are pretty standard, if well prepared. Read more Quality of food generally very solid and very good.
Since last visit staff seemed to turn over so while staff was enthusiastic appeared slightly unaware.
When my friend left the table they served her food. I had to requested to cover it or return to the kitchen. This always irks me.
Yet value and ambience and food quality and convenience to Lincoln Center makes this place a must! Read more Great restaurant! Definitely, we will come back again.  Amazing and beautiful place - great theater menu ! Had a grewr time  Not a good experience. I ordered the eggs with smoked salmon. Salmon was old.  I couldn’t believe the chef allowed the food to come out like that. Thankfully I moved the eggs to view the salmon but not after eating a few bites. It was a pale color and shredded texture and looked disgusting with black spots. I’ve never seen a salmon like this.  I returned it, they apologized. Then a crab ravioli was my next choice.  It was ok.  The star of the show was the employees at the  front of the house especially the bartender. He makes an excellent espresso martini.  The other star was the soufflé. If I ever come back it would only be for these two things. Skip the rest.  We live in NYC, there are better quality restaurants than this one. 2 stars for the pasty chef and the bartender. Read more My husband and I shared an appetizer followed by 2 entrees and 6 glasses of wine.  The calamari was bland and nothing special.  Both entrees and appetizers were very small portions.  I understand the restaurant is fine dining but the price did not justify the quality of the food or lack thereof regardless of portion.  The worst part is I invited my friend and his wife.  We all agreed we never left an Italian restaurant hungry until Rampoldi.  We thought it was odd that it was quite empty on a Saturday night.  Now we know why.  We all agreed we would not go back.  None-the-less, we want you to succeed and hope this review will provide you something to think about so you can do so. Read more Read more Excellent food and service! The atmosphere is nice, beautiful design! One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan!  Three months ago we celebrated Mother's Day at Rampoldi. We were absolutely happy there.

The room - red and White the colors of the Principality - is superb and luxurious.
Unfortunately the service is non-existing and please do not iron the nap clothe of the table next to us when we are still dining.
The food is mediocre . We had a loup de mer (  with the translation  branzino on the menu for the vulgum pecus ) excellent , but the vegetables served with it were the nightmare of any decent Chef.
The portions are large, but as my companion said , it can some time be a bad thing …
Expensive ? Not really if the Cuisine was good .
Will I come back ?

Immaculate service  Perfect dining experience near Lincoln Centet, can not wait to go back  I had the most incredible dining experience at Rampoldi NYC! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality by the manager, Enrique. He went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was exceptional.

Enrique recommended the duck confit dish, and it was absolutely delicious. The duck was cooked to perfection, with a crispy skin and tender, flavorful meat. The dish was beautifully presented and the flavors were outstanding. I could tell that the chef put a lot of thought and care into creating this dish.

The ambiance of the restaurant was also lovely, with elegant decor and a cozy atmosphere. The service was top-notch, with attentive staff who made sure that my dining experience was flawless.

Overall, I highly recommend Rampoldi NYC to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience. The food, service, and ambiance all exceeded my expectations, and I can't wait to come back and try more dishes from their menu. Thank you, Enrique, for a memorable dining experience!

The night was a success in everyway! Read more Compared to other fine dining establishments in the city, Allora disappointed me. Reservations were made after hearing splendid things about the vegetarian selection, but maybe the one on 5th Ave was the wrong choice. Mozerella was underwhelming with bites way too big, cheese very cold, and served on a bland raw tomato. The salad was very delicious, even though the Cesear was supposed to be prepared tableside and it was not. The dinner was also very saddening. The Pesto sauce was severely underseasoned, with the parmesan flakes placed on top being the dish's star, making the gnocchi almost inedible without it. After all these misfortunes, the thought of dessert terrified my group as we searched for cafes nearby daunted of even thinking of ordering from the restaurant. Overall, even though the location and ambiance were great, I was severely underwhelmed by the quality of the dishes, and even though it was nice, I will most likely not be dining at the very least at this specific location again.

The service was immaculate and was really made to feel like a queen. They made splitting the bill super easy, and gave us complimentary beverages and dessert. The best part was the service, and the wonderful restaurant staff who made us all feel like family (and gave me a personal sign that said “principessa” as the birthday girl). And of course can’t forget to mention how tasty the food was. Will definitely be back! Read more I booked this very last minute as I was craving Italian and it was very close to my hotel as it was forecast to rain that evening.

I was the first person in the restaurant and the staff was incredibly attentive.  The wine list by the glass was not expansive but offered some very good options.  Bread and an amuse bouche accompanied the wine, which was very nice.  I ordered the Caesar salad made table side, and my server recommended the rigatoni bolgnese.  The Caesar was good and the bolognese was superb!  I also had the mousse for dessert, which was a lovely ending to a very good meal.

Overall I highly recommend this restaurant. Read more Read more From the minute I booked Allora Fifth Avenue everything was perfection. This was for a work dinner with over 10 people (of varying dietary restrictions) and it was seamless. Food was great. Service was amazing! The entire team was impressed. Shout out to John who gave the best recommendations. You must get the caesar salad (dressing is prepared fresh table side). Read more It was Very good! This is a nice place.
I’ll come back  Delicious food, great service.  Lovely room.  Would definitely recommend and come again.  Understaffed and over-rated. Food was ok but very much a hotel restaurant that offers Amuse Bouche that did far more harm than good. Slow service. Flat.  Great experience at the restaurant.  I would definitely go again.  The service at Allora was amazing. Everyone there made sure we had the best dining experience possible!  What a great find!   I made a last minute reservation here and was optimistic based on reviews but every expectation I had was exceeded.  From the time we walked in until we left everything was outstanding. Service was top notch across the board and the food was delicious. From the Caesar salad made at tableside to the chocolate mousse for dessert, everything was perfect.  My entree was dentice Mediterranean which was packed with flavor.  I could eat it every day.  I can’t say enough good things about Allora!  We loved it. Read more Wait staff just kept walking around rearranging the tables. Very annoying and distracting. We were the only ones there. Food was decent.  Absolutely wonderful dinner at Allora Fifth Ave. The space is simple but so beautiful and elegant. The pappardelle with mushrooms was just amazing, and the snapper was divine. The banana tart was the perfect end to a perfect meal. My server John was phenomenal, and treated me like I was royalty. One of NYC’s best Italian restaurants. I look forward to returning. Read more This place was such a class act. The food was delectable. The ambiance was lovely. The service was exceptional.

I wrote a note indicating some special needs required (one guest with hearing problems, another with vision problems) and they did every single thing possible to accommodate us in a less noisy and well lit area. We were lucky that they weren’t super crowded yet (5:30 reservation) and so they were able to give us so much attention but they made the night so pleasant and comfortable, it was really special.

Can’t wait to return!! Highly recommend.

We ate and loved the Caesar salad, special salad with burrata and avocado and pistachio dust, veal parm, chicken scarpariello, and pesto gnocchi. All delish, and ranked in that order, favorite first.

The espresso martini was to die for.

Yum.

Fantastic menu and a great value for this part of town.  Would definitely recommend! Read more La comida fue muy decepcionante. Fuimos 4 personas. Mis hijos comieron unos rigatoni, con una salsa de tomate básica. El plato era muy pequeño y demasiado básico. La salsa parecía recién salida de una lata. También pedimos unos ravioles, eran 6 ravioles con una salsa también muy básica. Lo único “rico” fue el risotto de hongos, el cual hubo que compartir porque todos se quedaron con hambre y era el único plato de un tamaño decente. Tomamos dos copas de vino y pagamos 320 usd. Sinceramente me dolió pagar ese precio por una comida que podría haber hecho en mi casa. Lo positivo, las personas fueron muy amables y nos atendieron muy bien. Lamento dejar esta reseña pero me hubiera gustado leerla antes de ir. Read more Absolutely lovely experience! From the ambiance, to the service, to the food, everything was top notch! We were treated like VIPs, an experience I won't soon forget.  Last evening, my wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Allora Fifth Ave, and it was an experience that left us utterly enchanted. From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with the warmth and grace that one only dreams of finding in a dining establishment. The dining experience transported us back to a memorable dinner we had in a quaint village in Tuscany, Italy, some twenty years ago, with Allora embodying the epitome of Italian hospitality.

The service was impeccable, with our table being attended to by five or six different staff members, each specializing in a different function, yet all united in making us feel exceptionally welcome. This collaborative service approach is a testament to the restaurant's dedication to ensuring that every guest feels cherished and valued.

The highlight of our visit was undoubtedly the food. The veal marsala, in particular, was sublime, easily ranking as one of the top few I have ever had the joy of savoring. Its authenticity and exquisite flavor reminded us of the fabulous, authentic Italian dinners that are hard to come by outside of Italy.

We left Allora Fifth Ave feeling grateful for the discovery of such a gem. The whole experience was not just a meal but a celebration of Italian culture and cuisine. My wife and I are already looking forward to our next visit, and we're eager to share this wonderful find with our children soon. It's clear to us that Allora Fifth Ave will become a regular place to dine for our family, promising many more evenings of delightful dining and cherished memories. If someone is looking for a taste of true Italian hospitality and culinary excellence, Allora Fifth Ave is it. Read more Had an exceptional experience in their private room on the main floor. Elio was an extraordinary host and our entire party of eight had a delicious meal. We will definitely return soon.  The main waiter kept shaming the waiter in training in public. The salmon was flavorless, and the wine was mediocre. It’s the service that made this experience unbearable.  Always a wonderful time. Great service excellent food. Old school dining out at its finest.  Our first time here hosting out of town friends. We enjoyed the experience, starting with the friendly bartender and all the way through dessert and after dinner drinks. The mushroom risotto was delish. The rest of the table ordered the rigatoni. (Although they all enjoyed it, I think the guys would’ve liked a bigger serving.) We’ll be back! Read more We went here before a broadway show for lunch.  It was not that crowded as they had just opened.  The food was probably the best Italian I have had in a long long time, and my husband and I eat out at many Italian restaurants.  Fabulous!  Complimentary apps were outstanding!  The service was absolutely wonderful.  Our waiter, and I wish i could remember his name, was outstanding, friendly, personable and knowledgeable about the menu.  He made our dining experience a pleasure.  I will definitely go back to Allora, as a matter of fact, I'd like to stay at the hotel there.  Looks great!

I ordered a baked chicken with mashed potatoes (which was horrible) the mashed potatoes were very plain and tasteless, (in the end I had to order a new dish to eat which took me 40 minutes to receive) and even though the first dish was horrible I had to pay for it, in order to order another piña colada we had to wait a long time because we couldn't see the waiter anywhere or he didn't even come to our table on the way back and after being able to order it we had to wait for another 25 extra minutes to receive the drink.

Even if they will give me one copy before we leave, you are supposed to make it clear on your receipt that the gratitude is already included instead of fooling customers like this!!!!!

Food is good and the service is excellent. My family loved our waiter  Best Turkish food ever had. Very good costumer service  We had dinner here with our booking beginning at 7pm. It was quite full and there was only one server/host, I think the owner of the place, but she was able to cater to us among all other customers in a timely manner. The restaurant closed at 10pm but my friend and I lost track of time in conversation. We were not even asked to leave as there was still a party of 6 people and ourselves (party of 2). The host was so accommodating and welcomed us staying until after we were well done (sometime between 11pm -12am). Not once were we asked to leave. Also on dessert, we were able to get their almond pudding even around 11pm, and after the kitchen closed (which was something we wanted to taste while there).

We started with the complimentary warm, fresh bread and black olives. When the bread is delicious, I take it as a sign of good food coming. I wasn't disappointed. I had the lamb shank (although I added some salt & pepper) The meat fell off the bone.
We asked our waitress (CeeCee - who was excellent) for a desert recommendation and she suggested the almond pudding. I was a little skeptical, If you like almonds, you'll Love it. It was delicious, with almonds just blended well and a little crunchy. Read more The entree fish was not fresh; many items on the menu were not available. But service was excellent. The appetizers were fine.  The food is delicious. You can’t go wrong no matter what you order. This is a must go to place every time I’m in NY.  I started off with the red lentil soup (which was yellow) and had little flavor. I ordered two maze as my main course, they were the hummus and the babaganush. I found that I liked the babaganush, but did not like the taste of the hummus. In addition, the hummus had a flavor that, to me, differed in flavor significantly from most hummus found in other restaurants. Read more Good food overall. Grill Octopus is too mushy for me and too oily. Everything else great, such as eggplant salad, artichokes, sausage, and Adana kebab is a outstanding.
Excellent service. Read more Excellent dining experience for lunch. Thanks for the excellent service and welcoming ambiance. Highly recommended!  Sip Sak is an easy place to go for good food.

Solid place and ambiance. Food is great. Ordered the soba noodle salad and it was tasty but overtly ?lemony.  It was suppose to be a “small app” but it’s more of a medium entree. Also got egg rolls and was disappointed only vegetarian option was mushrooms as not everything vegetarian has to be mushroom based…there are actual vegetables out there. Ambiance is great.

For a restaurant that’s been open for 2 months, I expected the service to be on point! Lacked a bit of organization. Dirty plates were left at the table for far too long. Waitress Marcella was very polite and nice. The real issue was the food, lacking flavor and seasons. And just subpar of what’s expected from a chef Mina restaurant.

We were eager to try this new NYC home of the Michael Mina group located in the beautiful, iconic Essex House on Central Park South. What a great location - very easy to see The Park, Lincoln Square, shops at Columbus Circle and then have a world-class dinner before a nice walk down to theater past all the high end shopping on 5th, or jumping on subway right down block for a few stops to the rest of your evening.
Bar was bustling with great low tables and seating to gather and some excellent cocktails, including a great Old Fashioned, and perfect Martinis and Cosmos. Wine list was extensive. The dining room steps down the noise a bit and is filled with helpful but unobtrusive servers. Devin the maitre d' / Manager, and his team were gracious, knowledgeable, and professional.
The menu is a fresh update on classic steakhouse with something for everyone in our group ranging in age from 15-81. Everything we had was great from raw bar to apps to entrees and accompaniments. Don’t miss the Alaskan king crab rolling cart, or the raw bar with little neck clams and oysters on the half shell. We saw the seafood tower and it looked amazing. Apps included the bacon-wrapped scallops - wow, and the cherry tomato tart. Next time we also want to do the caviar service which is supposed to be great.
Entrees were exceptional.The ribeye was perfect, the phyllo crusted dover sole was great, the lamb chops were awesome, the half lobster was also perfection. Accompaniments included the spinach soufflé and black truffle Mac and cheese which isn’t presented thrown in a bowl as you think. We also had amazing jalapeño (I think) snap peas which aren’t on the online menu to look back on, but that’s a good sign they will be dynamic and seasonal for future visits.

We both chose the World Champion Burger 'The Pittsburgh Burger'. With this you get a free T-Shirt. Overall food was well presented & tasted very good. The service was very good & we were well looked after by our waiter who took time to explain how we collected our T-Shirts after the meal. This cafe in Time Square is huge with seating for 2000 plus & I would imagine it would be a little busier in the evenings / weekends.
As with all Hard Rock Cafes lots of memorabilia across the premises if you wish to take time & view. We visited the shop also to collect our T-Shirts & purchase a glass to add to our collection.

I had a great time celebrating my friend's birthday at Chazz Palminteri restaurant. She requested Italian and we were greeted with such warmth as Besnik was attentive and accommodating. I started with the Ceasar Salad as I read beforehand it was a must. I am glad I ordered it as a starter and I followed up with a Lemon Drop made to perfect and Branzino accompanied with mash and mixed vegetables. The ambience was divine and it was quiet where we had amazing conversation. My friend had the Ceasar Salad as well and Pollo Parmigiana with a Brazilian Cosmopolitan.

The waiter was very hard to hear (not because the restaurant was loud).  Throughout the evening the wait staff repeatedly delivered the wrong food to the wrong person at the table.  Next, and the real issue i had was in wine selection; we selected a middle of the road wine (mid 200's per bottle); the waiter, in front of the group (not off tot he side) said he recommended a different wine that was 'about the same price, a little more expensive); which i approved.  Upon getting the bill, the price per bottle was just under 400 per.  At one point in the dinner the wait staff began pulling the appetizers that still were being consumed and proceeded to 'dole' them out..  was weird.   The waiter was also difficult to understand at times..  there was a definite vibe that the waiter was trying to get us to buy more than we needed in addition to the wine issue.  The group felt the food was good but not in alignment with the prices...  one guest commented that the cheese cake was just okay; i had the lava cake and there wasn't much 'lava' to it.. almost dry..

This place looks good but really it’s not that good. IG and TicTok make it appear cool but it’s not.  We were there during a party so it was DJ’ed up and loud, not complaining tho. The fries are worth the price honestly. Drinks are sweeter than I’d like but that’s also fine. I’ll just order a straight drink next time Read more Had such a great experience! Delicious food (especially the tacos and the crème brûlée bread pudding) and lovely atmosphere. The drinks were super unique and delicious!  A very nice quiet place to tuck in and relax. So many places in NYC are crowded, rushed, and noisy. This was a welcome change. Food and Drinks were great- try the green juice!  Once again Allure did not disappoint. Excellent and personable service. Great food and a delightful and comfortable atmosphere.  Went for happy hour
Food was good and good value
The wine pour was too short  The surroundings are comfortable and service was good, but the food was not up to what we expected. The steak was tough and not well prepared, trout and burger were acceptable. Sides were uninspired. The bread pudding for desert was good. The issue is the neighborhood. There are too many better places to go within a few blocks. We wanted to eat at the hotel for convenience sake, but we would have liked a better product. Read more Welcome oasis after a tough trip. Excellent food and service. Lovely ambience.  Read more Very nice, relaxed atmosphere and good, friendly service.  Great addition to the Upper West Side. Mother's Day Brunch was a hit.  After other plans fell through the night before Mother’s Day, we went on OpenTable to try to find a last minute brunch option. Fortunately, Allure had a slot ready made for us! We had no idea the restaurant was here (tucked away inside the hotel which living as we do 4 blocks away, we’ve never needed to go inside) The restaurant space is lovely - full of light, not too crowded, and with a nice soundtrack that isn’t overpowering. We didn’t have any trouble hearing each other or feeling like the other tables were on top of us. The food was fantastic - it came out a bit slowly, but it was a busy morning and it was nice to not feel rushed in and out (and it was fresh and hot - it hadn’t been sitting under a heat lamp or anything!) And the true star was that everyone who worked there was friendly, charming, and so welcoming. We can’t wait to come back! Read more My wife, daughter, and I celebrated Mother's Day with a delightful brunch. We savored our time, seated at a lovely table, enjoying glasses of bubbles and sampling a variety of menu items. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience overall. Read more Very disorganized staff. Only 2 or 3 tables were booked but service not great. Too many servers not communicating with each other  The noise level can be bad. They should close off the bar from the rest of the place …  A beautiful place, but my fish was overdone and placed on a bed of a mushy mousse that was inedible. My husband’s steak was fatty and tough. The place is beautiful but there were only 2 other couples there from 7:00 - 8:30 while we ate dinner. Read more Visited Allure for the Kentucky Derby event and the atmosphere was fantastic. The venue was bustling with people, the food was delectable, and the crowd was lively and engaging. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves Read more My bf and I decided on Allure because of previous positive reviews and the proximity to the Beacon Theater.  We had reserved bar seating thinking we would only have a few drinks and maybe an appetizer but were offered table seating and decided to take it.  The tables are perfectly set apart, not too close, and the decor was really cool.  The drinks were excellent (heavy pour) and not overpriced.  The bonus is that happy hour runs more than an hour and has a really great selection of drinks and apps. I recommend the hummus.  By far that is the best I've ever had and very reasonably priced. We ordered a burger to split and it was MEH but the french-fries were delicious.  I saw dishes served to other tables and they did look good but I can't say how they tasted.  I would definitely give this place another go, even if it was just for the drinks and apps. Read more The bill was wrong we were charged for two bottles of Prosecco instead of two glasses.

Service is good. However, prices on the website menu are not current.  The ambience improved once the loud people next to us left. Nice spot. Reasonable prices for this area. Good food and cocktails. Great service. I’d recommend.  This place was amazing. I was able to book for a Bday gathering for one of my closest friend and Simi our waitress was great.

Great place for a casual get together or a date night. Priced affordable and well valued.  Great food and service but…
Tables so close together that it was hard to converse and it was so hot in there. Stuffy and no air movement.  Hidden gem. Food was excellent; service was friendly. Cozy and elevated decor. It is a tiny place so you will be cozy with strangers but it works.  Great food and drinks, very nice ambience. Cool place and the team was very nice.  The only person in our party who enjoyed their food was my wife.  She ordered the Gnochhi and enjoyed it.  Other than that the apps and entrees were sub par at best!  Would not recommend!  Great atmosphere and kind service! Would definitely recommend!  My 25-year-old daughter and I visited NYC for her first time, and we decided to stop at The Blue Dog Cookhouse and Bar before heading to see SIX on Broadway – and wow, what an incredible experience!

From the moment we walked in, the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made us feel welcome right away. Every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious, but the standout was the burger. My daughter said it was the BEST burger she’s ever had in her life – high praise from someone who knows her way around good food!

The vibe was perfect for a pre-theater meal, with a cozy yet lively atmosphere. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a relaxing sit-down, this spot has it all.

The service was top-notch—everyone, including the general manager, was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The smoothies were delicious, and the breakfast options were spot on. My only small 'complaint' was that the Huevos Rancheros weren’t spicy, but they were still full of flavor—this might even be a positive for others.

Zuma NY was incredible! The atmosphere was vibrant and stylish, creating the perfect setting for an unforgettable evening. The food was outstanding—fresh sushi and flavorful ribeye and asparagus, all beautifully presented. Service was top-notch, with attentive and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend for an amazing dining experience in NYC! Read more Wish we had a decent table to have the dinner l, they sat us at the very front of the restaurant, while I asked if we could get a good table.  Food is always good and service attentive. But when you book on open table, they stick you in the less desired locations- second floor under the speaker, first floor at the furthest corner by the service table facing the side of the bar. And this is when the restaurant is less than 10% full. We’ve been there three times using open table to make the reservation, and each time without fail we have to ask to switch the table. Read more Zuma is always a good option
Service
Food and service amazing  The food was very mediocre and very small portions for our entrée. We’re not recommend if hungry nobu gives better portions and nobu is a better restaurant. just had a fact we probably had the last reservation. I did not like how the staff was rushing us out and the server gave mediocre experience and very rushed. I suggest them not to have 1040 reservations available if they’re gonna rush people. Read more What a great meal we had! The staff was fantastic and the overall experience was exhilarating. Thank you Zuma.  Delicious food with excellent service as always.  We really enjoyed our lunch.  Food and service are excellent. The Wagyu gyoza are particularly delicious.  zuma is fantastisch
bediening en eten geweldig!!!  I found the service very disappointing. And the food and drinks not good value for money.  Read more I think it should be clear at reservation point where one would be seated.  Zuma has lost its edge. Food not as good as it used to be. And food delivery frustratingly inconsistent and slow.

My partner and I decided to go for restaurant week on a whim because we haven’t had a date night in a while, and they were super kind when we called to move up our reservation since we were free. 

When we arrived, the young lady in the front was super friendly. Our waitress was attentive and super kind, she even noticed that I had brought a gift for my partner and asked if we were celebrating anything. We said we were celebrating our anniversary, and we got a little surprise when we ordered dessert (there was an adorable sign and a candle that said happy anniversary on our dessert platter!)

The restaurant week menu was absolutely delicious, and the service was phenomenal. Sometimes I find that establishments treat those who go for restaurant week differently than customers paying full price, but that wasn’t the case here at Zuma. Everyone who passed by us was attentive, clearing the table even though they weren’t our server. Even the manager cleared dishes for us and checked in with us during our meal!

However, now that I've eaten there, I will DEFINITELY be back.

Decor is fabulous. It just feels good but has some fairly striking architectural details that are satisfying without being distracting.

The food was so much better than I expected. I really enjoyed every single bite. Visually beautifully presented. The portions were ample and thus the value for what we paid was terrific.

I had the Chef's Choice sushi and sashimi combination that comes with a roll of my choice. It was absolutely the perfect amount of food and extremely reasonable. It was presented with a mist of dry ice that impressed all the tables around us.

My dinner-mate had two rolls and although he's a good eater, he could not finish all of one of the rolls. He kept offering it because it was so good he didn't want it to go to waste, however I was too full.

The Miso soup is ample and delicious. Very flavorful without being too heavy.

Our waitress was very nice, but we felt like she kept pushing us to order before we were ready. We are just gotten together after not seeing each other for a long time and we needed a little time to settle in. I appreciate prompt service, but we must have told her 5 or 6 times that we weren't quite ready to order. It wasn't as though the restaurant was full and they needed to turn over the table. It was too late for another full seating and there were plenty of open tables on a Sunday evening. We simply could not understand why she was being so pushy to take our orders.

With the exception of that note, it couldn't have been a more perfect evening. Read more I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant. We split the pork Gyoza as our appetizer.

Never again  Great place, delicious food.
Reasonable prices. Delicious Passion Fruit mojitos.  My husband and I made reservations to go for the Canelo fight night which was promoted on social media. When we arrived we were taken to a seat where there’s no TV view so i asked for a better seat which they did give us. On social media mentioned blender having a special on drinks and food which was not the case. We still enjoyed our night and the food place is beautiful , but I feel like they should advertise and be more ready for this. But I’ll def go back again overall everything was good Read more The hospitality was amazing, they took care of us as soon as we walked in, the waitress was very kindful and the food were super good.  It’s a beautiful restaurant and the food and service is excellent. I highly recommend!  The best blend and Savannah is the best server respectfully.  Music was versitale and wonderful! Food was prompt and delicious! Everyone at the table had something a little different than what was on the menu and they were able to adjust our meals with ease. Drinks were wonderful! Will definitely come back and recommend to others! Read more The food was great and wonderful music! Have a birthday dinner on the 2fl and was more private!  Food is great but the service needs more work and be more attenuative to the customers.  Great place to eat and have drinks . Will be back soon  Read more Customer service was amazing, food was delicious also the drinks  Savannah was excellent as always, sat us down for our brunch of 4. Everything was amazing  We were there for lunch.  Two tiny corn cakes with a dot of short ribs was $10. Followed by a tasteless chicken empanada. The guy enjoyed his steak sandwich which he said was tasty and plentiful.  Fries were handcut and excellent.  A tiny non-alcoholic mojito filled mostly with ice and mint with very little liquid in the thin glass. Service was sporadic and non-attentive. Read more Food was overpriced well more so drinks really…overall it was tasty and not too loud good for date night  The ambiance at Blend Astoria was very festive and the decor was appealing.  The food was very good, but the pre-fix menu for Mother's Day was very limited and very expensive for what was offered. Overall, I would definitely visit again on a non-holiday. Read more I feel like the hostess took a bit long to come back to our table  Had a great brunch! Our waitress was super sweet!  Savannah always does a fabulous job. The food, music and drinks are always amazing. Blend Astoria has never disappointed me since they’ve been opened. Great job my brother DJ Camilo. ￼  The service provided was very good. My friend is allergic to peppers and the waitress was able to help with her meal  Very nice establishment , food was DELICIOUS 10/10! Will be going back!  Read more The music was a little too loud. We were also sat next to a large screaming party of people. The service was great. I would suggest that large parties be seated in other areas  Honestly this place is my favorite place ever, drink are amazing, food is amazing and service is amazing.  THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE!!! I enjoy going here. The service is amazing the accommodation to make everyone happy the place itself I really like it here. And I forever give a big shout out to my waiter Savannah SHE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!!! I request her everytime I go and she is working but everyone is really nice. Everyone make you feel welcome Read more I love this place the best food and drinks. I always have a good experience here. Take your love ones here. Even though they are small plates it’s worth the $$$  It was great food, good vibe, service was regular. Never got her name, feel like I got over charged but didn’t notice til I left the restaurant and realized she never gave me a receipt. I think we should be presented a check after every experience Read more Took my gf to here for V-Day. The ambiance was pretty nice. However, the main courses was honestly tasteless. I’ve never had a steak and chicken that bland. The appetizers were actually pretty decent. I heard the place was good so I assume that maybe it was the pressure of the busy day that throw them off. Read more Immaculate, the food, the drinks, the ambience! Take your boo here, you won’t regret it ;)  Very good experience and server was great. Noise wasn’t too bad either  This was my third time there, the food and dessert is amazing. The music is good. The service is always good and fast. Definitely recommend for a bday or a night out with friends  The place is beautiful. Great service.

Peppercorn sauce for the steak had no peppercorns, nor did it taste like peppercorns. Both steaks were undercooked for the temperature we requested.

Bacall’s is in a great location in the middle of the Broadway area. The food and drinks were very good. We had escargot (generous portion), beef carpaccio (way too small portion - not worth it), rigatoni (delicious) and the Branzino (fabulous). We went on a Sunday night and there were only 2 other tables filled in the entire restaurant. Not sure why since the area was packed just before an evening show. The service was excellent and the ambiance was old movie vibe. Would definitely go again. Read more While the food was pretty decent the overall experience was off. We didn’t get a drink list when we sat and I felt that threw off the whole experience. Our server just felt kind of annoyed by us. He never checked in with us after our food was served and never asked if we wanted another drink. Our appetizer tasted pretty good and our entrees were also fine. Just wish the service lived up to the food. Read more Read more Very happy with our reservation! Thanks so much for a great dinner before our show!

great and accommodating even though we were running late for our reservation. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Read more Loved the place - great food. In the Theater district.

The hanger steak was well prepared. The sirloin strip was a little fatty and overdone. The pasta was very disappointing. We thought we booked an Italian restaurant - only 4 Italian dishes on the menu and the one we had lacked flavor. Read more Service was fantastic. Food was good but not great- a solid 4.  Thursday nights Ladies get a free entree with the purchase of a cocktail and appetizer. Drinks, appetizers and entrees were delicious! The restaurant was not very busy, but the service was not great - our waiter was not very attentive. I arrived late (due to traffic), and my friend was already seated having her cocktail. My drink didn't get served until the main course was brought over (so after we'd had our appetizers) - and the waiter never came over to check to see how we were doing. We did make our 7pm show, so that wasn't an issue - but I would have expected better service. But the Food was delicious and you can't beat the Ladies free entree special on Thursday nights.

Could be better… place is being run still likes it’s a popular spot still.  Party of six celebrating two birthdays and seated upstairs in the third level in small room. No ambience, not part of the restaurant, was like being seated in a closet. Completely removes any diner from enjoying ambience and design of the restaurant - which is why you go to Tai. The food is otherwise average and commercial (try Wau or Macao Trading for real flavor).

Food was delicious and never disappoints, which is why we dine here frequently when we are in the city  Food was much less spectacular than I remembered it from ten years ago. 
Service was attentive but ultimately failed because the kitchen told him wrong details about a dish. It was about tuna on the lemon pasta dish. While I like raw fish, just adding a spoonful of raw tuna to this dish seems lazy. You can char it a bit to add some flavor to the fish at least. Anyways, would recommend the gnocchi basil dish.

Highly recommend  I love Eataly and the concept. They had a great special with an appetizer and a select group of pastas or a pizza. I chose the arancini for my appetizer and the gnocchi with seafood. Neither were very good. While the seafood was good, the sauce was somewhat boring. I asked for marinara for the arancini as they also were pretty bland, and the marinara was not that tasty.

Absolutely amazing place!!! Service was fantastic and the food and drinks were delicious  Fantastic all around! From the awesome drinks to the delicious food to the outstanding service and eclectic decor this place is your go to for a fun night out on the town!  Came here specifically for Girl Dinner and couldn’t do the deal because the entire table has  to participate. I called in advance prior to reserving to see if this was a rule. as someone in my party doesn’t drink and I was told that not everyone had to participate. The waitress was nice and got the manager who didn’t really offer any sort of compromise after I explained the scenario. Thankfully we were there during happy hour(which doesn’t include wine) Miscommunication aside Jack the bartender was extremely helpful. He got us condiments and drinks when our servers disappeared. The food was decent. The place is really cute and would definitely recommend for that but for tapa prices to be the same as entrees and not having it clearly stated online that your entire party has to participate in girl dinner, our night was slightly a let down because of it. Would probably only come back for drinks and that’s a maybe. Read more Great bar.

The service was excellent - the waitress was checking on us frequently enough to keep our drinks and food coming but not overwhelmingly often where we felt rushed. I really enjoyed the evening.

Calamari portion was big enough to be shared by three people. We enjoyed the salmon dish, eggplant pasta and pork chop, which was bigger than my head! Yummy gelato dessert, too. It’s a bit noisy, but very fun place. Nice waitstaff topped it off. Highly recommend. Read more This is a lovely Italian restaurant with well-trained staff: courteous, professional with no airs. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed that the tables had some breathing space to enjoy private conversation.

My bolognese pasta was fresh and tasty and my husband declared his ""the steak & portobello sandwich melted in the mouth"".  We would definitely return to this restaurant. Read more Nice restaurant with a good menu and alcohol selection. Service was a bit slow for a Tuesday evening. Cauliflower and fluke crudo were delicious and very light. Caesar salad was classically delicious. The lumache had great flavor but the pasta was undercooked and it quite al dente. We shared a dessert special which was some sort of brownie situation - it was meh. The dessert was more like a dense cake than a brownie. The flavors were inventive but a bit bland and not sweet enough to be a dessert. When the manager asked us how it was, we told her it was just ok and she immediately ran to the computer to comp us (which was very kind but totally unnecessary). Would try it again another time. Read more I go here often- really good food and service.  Lively scene.  We had a fabulous experience at Isabella’s. Everting from the food to the service was top notch. We are looking forward to hosting a private event there in a few weeks.  Lovely restaurant but we could barely hear each other talk… our sever was fabulous!!  bad food, bad service, noisy.

Never again.

Good wine though. Read more I was in NYC for work, it also happened to be my birthday. I wanted to go for dinner somewhere to celebrate and found Isabelle’s. I had such a lovely solo birthday dinner, started with the rosemary focaccia then had the pasta and the dolce de Leche  for dessert.  I had a special request for my dessert, since it’s tradition to make a wish on a birthday candle I asked the server if they could add one. Not only did they add one they brought me a cappuccino, a shot of espresso martini and my dessert with a candle. The staff sang me happy birthday and for that moment I wasn’t celebrating my birthday alone. It was so lovely and beyond what I was expecting. Sometimes we don’t have the chance to decide when we travel for work and that small act of kindness from Isabelle’s made an already amazing day that much better. Read more Wow! Simply wow! absolutely amazing evening and every possible way. Most creatively imaginative spin on Italian I have tasted in ages and everything was absolutely spectacular, seasoned to perfection and presented beautifully. The drinks were absolutely delicious and the place is gorgeous. Also, a shout out to our server! By far, the best service I have had in New York City that I can remember. Can’t wait to go back ! Read more  Wonderful freshness and flavor!  Homemade ravioli was light and absolutely delicious- nothing overpowering.  Bolognese that my husband enjoyed had abundant meat and fresh noodles.  Superb service from Brian and crew.  Never felt rushed from the table.  Modern and comfortable decor with a welcoming vibe.  Would not hesitate to return! Read more Food was fantastic and the service was amazing.    We will go back.  Very enjoyable time. We were.a.party of 8.  Had great service and the food was terrific.

Would definitely come back again. Read more I ordered the Lumache and it was the best pasta I've ever had.  My wife is very picky about Italian food and she thought here bolognese was excellent.  Also, bottomless drinks at brunch was a nice feature.  We were visiting NYC from out of town and will definitely come back when we visit the city again. Read more Very nice place food excellent!

Noise level very high especially when full and they are playing music on top of that extremely difficult to have a co Read more Very good food, service was fast and the meals came out quickly, it was very loud with the music and other guests but was a very enjoyable dinner.  I recently had the pleasure of dining at Isabells, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, the hostess greeted us with a warm and friendly smile, making us feel right at home. We were fortunate to visit during Restaurant Week, and the special dinner menu was absolutely fantastic. Each course was thoughtfully curated, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to quality and authenticity. The appetizers were a delightful start, with flavors that perfectly set the tone for the meal. The main courses were nothing short of spectacular. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauces were rich and flavorful. Every bite was a testament to the skill and passion of the chefs. The salmon dish was fresh and exquisitely seasoned.
To top it all off, the dessert was a heavenly conclusion to an already wonderful meal. The service throughout was impeccable, with attentive and knowledgeable staff who enhanced the overall dining experience. Read more Das Essen war in allen Bereichen ein Gedicht.

This is the loudest restaurant ever. We chose to sit outside as a result. The food was mostly very good - the entrees were all very good - but there was a mishap (something about the printer running out of paper and our ticket never printed?) and our dinner took over 2 hours to arrive. Our waiter gave us the excuse but never checked on us or apologized for the delay. Two hours was too long to wait especially given the people we had there. They were gracious enough to give us a gift card for the restaurant. Read more  The entire experience, from the staff to the food and atmosphere, was absolutely exceptional. This is definitely a place you must visit.  Delicious Italian food. Beautiful restaurant and ambiance.  We had a party of 6, & the service was extremely good, especially considering our party size & multitude of food & drinks ordered.
Interesting wine list, with reasonably fair pricing for NYC.
Re:  the food, great trout,, chickens & prawn mains & everything was well prepared & all enjoyed their selections, as well as great apps & sides.
Shared deserts were all exceptional.
Again a call out to the waiter & bus staff. We'll be back Read more Came here for brunch and to celebrate my best friends birthday. All I can say we were underwhelmed and disappointed. It is a super cute place and loved the decor but that is about where the positives stop. It was so incredibly loud and was only half the dining room was full. Took a minute to be greeted by our waiter and seemed to be a little confusion as to who actually had our table so we were ordering twice. Ordered the foccacia of the day and it was good not spectacular especially for $22. We also ordered bottomless and our drinks took a while to get to the table. The worst was our entrees. Lemon ravioli and shrimp benedict. Took nearly 30-35 minutes to come out and the pasta was bland with very little lemon detected and the shrimp was overcooked. I think our server realized we were a bit annoyed and did bring us birthday shots on the house but it was a little to late to make up for a very underwhelming dining experience. We only had a couple bites before we asked for the check and left. I wanted to like this place so much because it is so cute but it just overall so disappointing especially for the price point. Oh and should mention while we waited for our entrees, food was coming out for other tables and the runners and servers looked and were audibly confused and flustered as to what plate was what and where it needed to go. Not really reassuring that anyone knew what was going on or that anyone was running the ship. Read more Brunch is always excellent!
Their Caesar salad and Cauliflower appetizers are delicious.
Their Tagliatelle Bolognese is beyond!  I have been to Isabelles before and enjoyed it.  The service tonight was so bad that I will not be going back.  Only one person ordered an app but the waiter held the entire table's food order back because of the one app.  Then when I inquired he kept making excuses for why it took almost 50 min after we ordered to get our entrees.  Just admit you screwed up.  I will NOT be going back. Neither will anyone in my party. Read more The restaurant is extremely loud so it's not a good place to enjoy a conversation. Most of the food was good but the meat balls were uneatable.  Swanky yet neighborly, Isabelle’s is a great choice for date night or impressing a bunch of friends from out of town. Great service, drink selection and tasty menu equals a perfect night out in Gramercy. Read more Really good food; excellent service.   Wonderful find in the Gramercy/Union Square area.

We started with a couple great fall cocktails.  Dinner was the chicken breast, with a side of broccoli and the Autumn pear pizza (of which half was taken home).  The chicken was juicy and tasty and a robust fall meal - with mashed potatoes with porcini mushrooms.  The pizza was outstanding!  A tasty mix of pears, crispy prosciutto, carnalized onions, blue cheese & balsamic vinegar reduction.  My partner doesn't particularly like most pizza (too much cheese & greasy), but he really enjoyed my dinner!

Thank you  This was my first dinner and Sandro’s and it was wonderful. The fennel salad was delicious and the spaghetti limon met all expectations!  Sandro’s is simply one of the best dining experiences you can find. Not only is the food consistently excellent, but the entire team is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. The bucatini amatriciana here is better than any I’ve had in Rome—rich, savory, and cooked to al dente perfection. Another highlight of the night was the spaghetti with anchovy and melon special. Such an inventive and unique combination that truly works. The flavors were unexpected, but they came together beautifully in a dish that was fresh, different, and delightful.

My friend felt her Aloo Gobi could have been spicier, didn’t have a medium spice level. We also ordered Roti and the entrees came with cumin rice.

The special lamb chops required a chain saw to cut through and were nearly flavorless while the hockey puck of potato galette was similarly without taste and had an odd pasty quality while also being undercooked. The tarte citron was inedible with a pastry crust as hard as cardboard and the lemon curd a soupy slop of pudding -- again without a hint of taste of lemon.

Very good Italian, have been there twice and will be back! Good service and an excellent selection of wines  Wonderful ambiance. Great background music. Excellent service.  The meal was awesome too.  Glad to spend my birthday there.  Dessert was an awesome Apple strudel with gelato on the side.  We’ll definitely be back.  Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars. Read more Nice vibe, great food, wonderful staff. All around a great experience.Definitely coming back!  Salmon tartare had a weird taste and I had to send it back. The Mortadella was drenched in balsamic vinegar sauce which I have never seen before. Burrata was tasteless and at least 3 days old if not more. The fish (branzino) was frozen and tasted like it despite a nice try to cover it up with some sauce and vegetables.
Italian dishes should be simple and based on fresh ingredients. Mine had none of that.
I suggest the owner to hire an Italian trained cook, correct the many Italian misspelled words on the menu if they want to appeal to a discerning clientele. Read more Delicious food, lovely decor and ambiance, very good service. We would only recommend they reconsider their choice of music as well as its sound level. A pulsing, energetic bass was an annoyance in such an otherwise lovely, soothing dining environment. Read more Loved our waiter, the manager was lovely, and food / wine was excellent. Great experience and attention to detail for my parents Anniversary.  Delicious Northern Italian dishes with a lovely enclosed patio behind the restaurant proper.  Friendly from the floor manager to the bartender/waitstaff, attentive but never invasive and in the context of ever-rising prices on food and drinks, they're managing to keep a reasonable ratio between value matching ingredient/presentation quality.

Not special in any way and we are happy we tried it.  Paulo was awesome !   Great dinner and drinks. Great atmosphere .  The experience at Barolo was incredible. The service was absolutely extraordinary. The wait staff attending to us was extremely friendly, very professional. He knew the menu very well and gave excellent suggestions when we had questions about the menu. He was very attentive and refilled our water almost immediately when the glass was half empty. 
The ambience of the restaurant was impeccable. It was quiet and the lighting was perfect. It was romantic and moody. 
The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the mushroom appetizer, the ravioli and the chicken pasta. Everything was perfect! The bread basket and the dip with it was excellent. Their wine selection is huge. The tiramisu was extraordinary. 
Overall, an incredible experience. Read more Great choice! The bread was fresh, & came with EVO & Balsamic to dip.
Had the caprese app, the veal dinner special (excellent), the scallops, shrimp, & beef with fingerling potatoes, & veggies, & an amazing espresso martini, highly recommend getting one.
Our server was attentive, & the manager offered a complimentary Limoncello after dinner drink.
Def will return, & will recommend 🤌🏼! Read more Bread was Pepperidge farm essentially, burrata was flavorless and served with domestic prosciutto and tomatoes you’d find on the street. Moving to the main course, avoid the zucchini pasta unless you want barilla whole wheat protein plus with a singular zucchini cut in 3rds and a whole bag of cold kraft cheese on top with absolutely no seasoning. Thanks.(tiramisu was okay but should be anyway) Read more Nice ambiance, caring service, big surprize every time food came to the table - it just looked so awesome and tasted even better!.  Had a great meal and the service was great - the fried burrata special was yummy and so was the soup.  Barolo East once again was a wonderful experience and served a fantastic meal!

1) Waited 25 minutes past the reservation time to be seated.
2) They were very nice about the wait and promised some free appetizers and then an order of meatballs showed up without even asking if we ate meat!
3) My steak was burned and overcooked, but my companions steak was well prepared. Crab cake was excellent.

Brilliant level of performance over an incredible amount of time!  Everything was great  The steak is good taste and servers are great. However, the noise around make me uncomfortable…  Everything was terrific. The Yorkshire creamed spinach is sublime.  Best guy in the front that was seating us  , our table was delayed about an hour.

Beautiful restaurant.  Our server was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious.. steak cooked and seasoned perfectly. Smoked rib appetizer soft and very flavorful. Crusted salmon on point.

I had arranged to pay in advance and that worked smoothly and everyone cooperated!  From the hostess to all the servers,  everyone was charming and welcoming and the food delicious. A superb and happy night! Thanks to all who made it so — the server even took a great photo of our table! Read more Service was extremely slow despite there only being a few tables occupied when we arrived. Not sure that they have the best systems in place as we never knew who our waiter was. The food was excellent—just took forever to order. Read more I go to Island often because I live in the neighborhood and usually the food is very good. But this time I had the avocado toast for the first time and it was very average - it was small and the bread didn’t seem very good or fresh. It also wasn’t toasted and avocado toast should be toasted. The service was not great - waitress not particularly nice or friendly and she left quickly a couple of times without waiting for my drink order. We had to wave over another waiter to order a glass of rose. We sat in the outdoor shed and the tables were very tight - I barely had any room to push out my chair because the person behind me was so close. I prefer sitting indoors at Island but it was such a nice day that I thought it would be nicer to sit outdoors. Overall a disappointing lunch for the expensive bill. Read more Lunch was tasty. Waitress very nice. Want to go again.  Good food, excellent service, relatively quiet room.  Very enjoyable overall.  Great food and atmosphere! Very nice menu and great friendly staff- will return soon.  As always- we were greeted warmly and treated wonderfully during our meal. Thx again to all for making us feel so welcome-and for ensuring another fabulous date night dinner out for us!!  We ate outside under covering and the environment was pleasant. Excellent service. Many food choices.  The food was lovely and our waitress - Renata - was great.  This is our go to neighborhood restaurant for lunch. It is consistently good. It was quite crowded today, Saturday, so the service was not as attentive as usual  Read more Always reliable food and good service.  The tomato soup was soo good!  always a great place to meet! Terrific food and a neighborhood gem.  Top quality neighborhood restaurant. Very good food, well chosen wines by the glass, and excellent service.

A true neighborhood restaurant.  It's a nice brunch spot close to museums but I was surprisingly disappointed by the food.  There were some very basic and obvious issues like poached eggs being almost hardboiled, though the hash it was served on was flavorful, and an underwhelming cobb salad. Nice atmosphere for catching up with dining companions though and attentive service.

We really enjoyed our time there and can’t wait to come back! Read more An intimate and delicious experience, booked at shorter notice than you’d expect. Truly wonderful.  Such an amazing hidden gem in NYC, worth the find and price  Amazing cool experience.  Love the feel of the place, like you’re in an underground bar that serves amazing sushi!  Loved everything about this place. Food was delicious, ambience was fun & the sushi waiters brought a lot of fun energy. Will definitely come back!  A hip secret underground feel  What an amazing find!  Amazing food.  Fabulous ambiance.  We didn’t realize that it only sits 8 people and that we all do the Omakase - it was just dumb luck and due to good reviews that I booked this.

Read more Sushi is absolutely incredible. This is a hidden gem. Would eat here every day if I could!  Meal was quick (30 min).  Cocktails were tasty, but a little weak.  Food was great, but torched albacore/waygu was a tad overcooked.  Not a place to linger.  I booked for dinner but i feel like it was a lunchtime rush hour that the chef forced customers to eat as fast as they can to turn to the next round. The word to describe is “omakase express” or “omakase kindergarten” I’m not crazy about the chef at all. He was unprofessional and unhappy working. Read more Read more Very good, fresh, sympathique
Accueillant
Formidable  Best Sushi, great price, quality and time! We always come back here!  As always this place is a gem. The food is excellent and 12 pieces for $65 is a great deal. The prices on the sake are a bit pricey
I go each time I am in nyc  Excellent place to go. Love the staff and experience  Honestly, this place should be shut down. Horrible experience all around. Mushy rice and the fish is not looking fresh. The tables are not even wiped after each guests…  The quality of the food is always good . What i dint like was how sketchy the place was lol . Felt like a underground club . Compared to the other locations like bayside and juelan that ive been too , that setting with the graffiti and stuff i dint like . It looked different Read more I used to love coming here but the last visit had extremely small bites, no wet towels to clean your fingers between bites and overall a disappointment. Will give this place a break.  It was very rushed and the quality wasn’t there. Before we finished one piece, the next one was out. It felt almost like a race or that they wanted us out of there as fast as possible. The sushi itself was very average. Definitely not worth $70 per person. Other omakase are much higher quality for the same price. I’m really disappointed, as I was hoping this would be a nice birthday gift. Read more What to expect: 10 pieces of sushi served in 35 mins.
Surprised to find some sushi rice undercooked (hard grainy) but the chef made sushi with their hands but  didn’t even notice? I doubt if they were properly trained. The fish and seafood used are fresh and of good quality though. I would avoid this place, it’s not real omakase. Read more I paid 77 dollars and left there hungry. Fifteen dishes sounds like a lot, but in total it's a bite of a Nigerian and that's all the dishes.... It was very meager. And very unpleasant, a waste of money Read more Read more Love it here so much! My favorite go to spot when I’m in town. Never disappoints! Best staff ever!  The food was great but it was a 30 minute, 12 course experience. If you go there just know that they need you to be out of there in about 45 mins as they have the next seating starting at the hour. Its not one of those relaxed omakase experiences. It's pretty much one course every 2 mins and out you go. 
The food was great and the omakase itself was delicious.
They can only seat 10 people at a time so 45 mins is all you get. Read more I was so disappointed. I literally could have gotten better sushi from the hole in the wall sushi place near my house or the grocery store. It was SO basic! Literally a piece of fish with some soy sauce brushed on it to make it look fancy! Read more Best sushi ever, very high quality and innovative.  I missed IMAX there, but it was a wonderful experience and delicious sushi as always!  Place is the best secret in nyc. Great food. Great vibe.  Good for a first time experience, we went a second time and honestly we didn’t enjoy it nearly as much. The novelty had worn off and to us there was nothing different here than any other sushi restaurant other than not choosing what we ordered. 

The first time we went we got more attention, conversation, and insight from our chef. This time it was just “here's the scallop” eat “next is salmon”. And unfortunately for the price I would like 5% more than just eat the sushi and get out within 45 minutes. Read more Very nice place and service! We came late and they were fine with that!  Wonderful experience and delicious sushi. Can’t wait to go back!  Good value. So I hear. It was my first Omakase. Venus seats eight at a sushi bar. And that’s all.  This would’ve been a lot of fun as a group reservation. Average ratings were for average assembly of food (I really did not understand yuzu pairing with fish and Wagyu with Uni). Presentation was mediocre. Chefs did not communicate. Drinks were ok and expensive. And the focus was more on turning the table over than a memorable experience. I understand now why some do not “appreciate being told what to eat.” I expected at least some persuasion, but there was none. Will try other places before returning to this one.

We thought these sauces were included with the meal and I was astonished to find out that we paid almost $40 for little sauces on the side which we would have never gotten if we knew it would be extra. Also, someone in our party was celebrating a birthday, and instead of our server giving us a dessert menu to choose from he voluntarily added a dessert to our bill that we were not aware of without confirming. The food and vibe was nice it was just the non-transparency from our waiter that allowed me to rate this experience a 3/5. Read more Read more An example on good service.

It was annoying to have to do after she stated she would take care of it. Then when they came with the cheesecake n candle the server (not ours) just set it on the table n abruptly left.

The only thing that mars the experience is the physical condition of the restaurant; especially the downstairs bathrooms.

For the calibre of restaurant, Sarabeth should invest in a carpenter to refurbish the baseboards and install new faucets to replace the rusted ones. Read more My reliable “go to” spot on Amsterdam Avenue. Always friends with good food.  A favorite Upper West Side eatery.  I’ve always found the food good. Tonight was lightly seared scallops & corn for me, a burger & fries for my friend. I love the burgers too, but wanted to try something different, and wasn’t disappointed.  Finish the meal with the dense,, yet creamy, truffle chocolate cake, served with a dollop of whipped cream + raspberry garnish. Yum! 

There was music in the dining area, which I don’t  remember hearing on other visits.  It was a nice complement,  and wasn’t overpowering.  And kudos to the solicitous staff! 

I’d recommend this restaurant for any occasion. (The pre-listed parameters shown on this Open Table survey are too narrow in scope) Read more Sarabeth's is our ""go-to"" place for brunch.  Can't go wrong.  I’ve been there many times and it never disappoints! Wild mushroom popover was delicious!  Consistently enjoyable. The manager, Jordan, is always very welcoming and accommodating. The go- to place for me  Had the lobster roll and it came with chips which was great.  The wait staff was attentive but not over bearing. Also the manager ( assuming) checked in a couple of times.  Always my favorite spot for breakfast when I’m in the City.  As always, Sarabeth’s is a lovely place to get together with friends. I appreciated the ability to linger over our lunch without being rushed out. Only complaint is that the popover I had was very dry and didn’t taste fresh. Read more After giving us our drinks, waiter was not seen again for 48 minutes (including no offer of drink refills) until he brought our breakfast, which was pancakes and avocado toast.

I'm sure I'll be back. Read more Excellent meal and great service!  We will return!  Unless you want the popovers, very Pricey for breakfast - I prefer a diner.  Eggs were over cooked.  My dish was missing items.  We love this place because the eggs benedict are exceptional and the staff is very welcoming  Excellent omelettes, fruit bowls and service!! We got there early on a Saturday (9am) and it got noisier as it filled up although they seated us as well as they could for the noise.  We were happy with everything! Read more  Not quite what it used to be to be when it first hit the brunch scene. Watery chicken pot pie. Mushy French toast. At least the omelet is still fluffy.  Food and service always excellent!
Very pricy but to be expected!  Great meal at consistently great place: salmon with Miso and roasted chicken with veggies. Also lemonade.  Highly recommend for omelette, hamburger and French toast. Beautifully presented. Service was great.  The thing to eat here is the popovers. Can't beat them or get them somewhere else. The food is tasty but the service can be spotty. Went for brunch, so maybe dinner is better. Not a lot of vegetarian options. Read more Sitting outside on a beautiful Spring day was delightful! Food was very tasty.  Food disappointing service great , our server was wonderful too bad the food was so poor, all four at our table had same experience with different meals  I think the food was ok. My lox and eggs were runny. I also thing that they need to have gluten free bread as an option.  In 2024 it seems strange to not have that. The coffee was lukewarm. Service was very good.

The cocktails also tasted great, but they gave us a headache about 20-25 mins after, not fun for someone trying to enjoy their day after brunch!

In terms of pricing, they are similarly priced to other spots in the area—but one suggestion would be to update their menu online, brunch prices were misleading and were about $6-$7 more per item than advertised on their website.

Waitress kept trying to take appetizer plates away, that still had small portions of food we were working on. We asked her for more water, never got it; asked for coffee with our dessert, she told us they did not serve coffee (after speaking to manager on our way out, he clarified they did have drip coffee and assured it would be available at our next visit).

Our waitress was a dream ! A lovely evening on the sidewalk with great weather  Food was not as good as usual, and the restaurant was understaffed for a holiday.  Our reservation request for a regular table wasn't honored (we had requested regular indoor seating but all those tables were full), we had to ask for menus, track down a server (who was terrific, but overworked) to take our order, make several requests for mustard, ask several times for our check and to have our payment processed.

A local bistro charges $14.50 for an unremarkable side of four (!) skinny carrots,; all the vegetable sides here are $8 and four for $18.   There are also plenty of non-vegetable options.

The oysters we ordered were fine, but very small, which we would have been OK with if they were ""happy hour"" oysters as in other oyster/raw bar restaurants, but at $3.50 or so an oyster, was unacceptable.

Definitely worth spending my birthday at boske Read more Horrible experience, I did a reservation and i got a table, I went with a couple of friends and once we seated down, they said that the table is for a minimum of two bottles and if we not getting it, we have to move like why they make you seat to tell you that. Also, we went there to spend money not to ask for free stuff and they made me to walk away like do you really know how to run a business?? Read more I absolutely recommend this place.. the vibes was so chill and relaxing. Food was excellent and service was stellar. The Live DJ had us dancing and moving in our seats. There was easy parking available. Definitely will be back and recommend this place. Read more Experience at Boske was great , Fast service good food and strong drinks. Music selection could have been more diverse  The guy at the door was very nice and polite, but the lady that was in charge of our table looks like she attended out table just because she was assigned and not because she was happy doing her job, we asked her if she could ask to lower the noise a little bid, ""it got worse"".  Terrible, and then it was too expensive just for tres golpes, wins and some yuca crepes.  Worse, we asked her to get separated bills, since not every one had drinks, 🍻. She brought only one bill that we had to divided the bill between us.  It was not faire for the one that didn't drink and only had water and the avocado toast.
Since the sound was so loud, we decided to leave the place as soon we eat and went to another place and enjoyed it Read more Food was excellent. However the ac was dripping on the table and it didn’t seem urgent for them to move us. Waitress was not very accommodating. They were nice when singing happy birthday to my sister. Read more The service was amazing and loved the music. However I feel like the food lacked freshness.  Our server barely spoke English, we had to converse using google translate. We came for ladies night but no where does it say it starts at 7pm and we got there at 630pm. So we had to do the happy hour, no problem, drinks were decent I like the coconut fish one. We got a Mac and cheese with chicken, the server didn’t tell us adding chicken would make the price go from 8 to regular price $16, after we asked if esta mas dinero por pollo, she said no.

We got the bill for:

X2 - $8 happy hour drinks
X1 - sparkling water
X1 - Mac and cheese

$50+ total for what. We ordered off the happy hour. We were planning to just do the happy hour for 30 mins so we could do the ladies night but for happy hour if I’m already paying $50 and we didn’t get anything substantial what’s the point.

Originally for 2 people the waitress added large group tax even though there were 2 people, we had to change it and she put a 18% automatic gratuity. Once we saw all this it was best for us to go somewhere else to enjoy the rest of your dinner. Read more Nice ambiance , good music , amazing service .

Mi lugar favorito de ahora en adelante sin duda alguna  Overpriced trendy redesigned Latino fusion spot, brunch food was tasty and the jungle juice, well is just juice $156 for two for  brunch is wild.  2 boske brunch 1 extra cocktail & 2 overpriced sparkling water. May return. Read more Food is absolutely delicious and ambiance and music are just right for the time of day/night you’re here. Parking in the area is tough so arrive early! We ended up losing our reservation because it took us over 30 mins to find parking, but the staff was great and squeezed us in after a wait. Only negative is that they sang happy birthday for every table except ours instead ours just got the dessert for my friends birthday no song like the others, wish they had done the same as the other tables. Read more I wasn’t impressed by the overpriced food or drinks. $16 for water is absurd and the service was not friendly.

Classic Lebanese!
Wonderful experience!  Food was ok. However the service was terrible. There was only one person managing and serving the entire floor. It would take 30 mins for him to get to our table each time. The final order of a platter took over 30 mins to arrive. He was doing the best he can and I would give this person 5 stars for himself. But the whole experience was not good at all. The bartender wasn't there either so we couldn't put the beverage orders we wanted- so no booze at all. Read more Underwhelming. One server attending to all tables. Rushed and overwhelmed. Food was ok. Service un attentive. We had to clean the table ourselves and put plates away.  First time there, 4 of us. Food was high spot. Service just ok. Had to search for waiter several times for drink from bar that never came with wines ordered by others. Also waiter never looked our way when we tried to get check. Atmosphere ok but very noisy table with young kids nearby whose shrill voices terribly unpleasant and distracting. This was a Sat night 8 pm res so likely rare occurrence.

I was with my husband, his nephew and the nephew's girlfriend, and we all are still a little high from the joy of it all 48 hours later.  Food was exceptional (surprisingly).  Our server couldn't have been more kind, sincere, and attentive. All of the performers were stellar but two numbers (""Annie"" and Laura Branigan) were the most rapturously fun drag numbers I think I've ever seen.  Ginger Snaps was on point!

They performed a nice quiet intimate birthday serenade to my fiance and gave her a very delicious complimentary happy birthday cheesecake. The service was very attentive and elegant. That was for dinner and the food was awesome!!! Read more Nice Atmosphere and a good Service a lovely place but not cheap.  Good lunches, attentive service and a quiet ambiance with tables well spaced.  The food was amazing!! The waiters  were attentive and amicable.  The ambience was lack luster, but it was a Sunday afternoon, so that can explain the vibe.  Fabulous service, only surpassed by the fabulous food. Extraordinary.  Amazing cocktails!!  The cheese/charcuterie were outstanding, as was the burger.  Delicious breakfast. Drinks are expensive $11 for an orange juice, but was freshly squeezed and they refilled the glass so it was worth it. Great service. Lovely peaceful atmosphere.  There were many positive reviews on Open Table so we decided to give it a try.  We live in NYC and we dine out frequently.  So the first thing we noticed was how empty the restaurant was on a Friday night. Second, the service was slow and the main dish came out only after we asked about it.   The octopus appetizer consisted of one tentacle and a bunch of potatoes for $25.  The little gem salad was good but not much substance for $20.  The halibut was dry and fishy.  So now we know why this restaurant offers 1000 points during prime dining hours. Read more Wonderful menu and great service.   Our meal was prepared really well and the ambience of the place was excellent. Will be back.  Portions were small. My appetizer was size of finger food. Food was Ok.

food here is always excellent and the help very attentive but gives you space to
speak with your dinner companions. Read more The food was mouth-wateringly tasty. Well presented. Only the tables were a little small.  We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant.  Sahara's had everything we look for - small, quiet, great service, and food that someone cared about in preparing it.  The lamb dishes are excellent.  The vegetable dishes are varied and creative with just the right spices.  Highly recommended. Read more I booked my reservation based on reviews as I was looking for a restaurant in a certain part of town. Apparently there was a LARGE party taking over almost the whole place with a few tables in the front for the general public. Everything was good until the birthday person with the large party started talking and took about a half hour. The restaurant isn’t large and the servers didn’t come to my table to check in to see if I wanted dessert which I did. There was also another table near me (not with the party) who wanted dessert. The server said the kitchen was closed and the person said that the waiter never showed up to ask and they wanted dessert. The waiter brought the dessert for that table. If there is a party that takes over 90% of your space, then don’t seat the public if you can’t service the tables properly. I prefer quaint neighborhood places over large restaurants and wouldn’t go back based on my experience. Read more Go for the appetizers, both hot and cold! All are no miss; Zucchini pancake, hummus, tarama, baba served with wonderful hot bread.  Wait staff is cordial, but forgetful. Good selection of Turkish beers and wines worth trying.

I totally love their chicken soup and spinach pie.  Just so yummy!  Great breakfast and a very friendly reception,  The bagels there and all over Manhattan are a little disappointing. They are all moving to a softer dough that is more like brioche. A real bagel needs jaw muscles and teeth.  We were told that the real deal is now only found in Brooklyn.

Great breakfast menu.   Diner is nice. Service was really good. Ordered the pork chop medium and it was flavorful but unfortunately overcooked. I would still go back and eat there again.  Extremely friendly and helpful staff, and the food was excellent. Only warning is that my phone said there were plenty of open tables, but when we got there the line was out the door.

Will.be back Read more Turkey sandwich was Oscar Meyers Turkey cut in half and dumped on the bread. I expected real deli meat.  Butter! Not much attention paid to butter but... When it comes to the table still frozen it's a pain and often left on the plate in little frozen chunks. At the Carnegie Diner & Cafe the butter arrived at the proper usable table. It's a small detail but it was enough to make everything else better. 

We ate there and then we returned again the next day. If we stay in that area we will return to  the Carnegie Diner & Cafe because the food is excellent, the service is excellent and they take care of details. WONDERFUL! Read more I can’t say enough about the food. It was delicious. The portions were big. Couldn’t finish everything on the plate for sure. I got a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, cheese, aioli, lettuce tomato. My cousin got a Reuben burger. They were both messy in the best way. We had to eat with a fork and knife.

 The only reason it wasn’t perfect was they didn’t honor any of our small changes. Example, I ordered a mocktail with water instead of tonic because I can’t drink carbonation. Asked for no tomato on one and it came with tomato. Whatever. My son drank the mocktail and we took off the tomato. We had such an enjoyable experience overall that I feel bad even mentioning it. It’s important to know for someone who has strict dietary requirements.

We had been at this restaurant many times prior. Before we were seated, I observed that a note indicating “birthday “ was given to the waiter. The waiter was rude and inattentive throughout the meal. We ordered dessert and when it arrived, there was no acknowledgment for my daughter’s birthday. Meanwhile, I observed the same waiter bringing dessert to two other tables with a candle and singing happy birthday. Also, my daughter opened her birthday cards while we were at the table and they were clearly visible to the waiter. I spoke with the manager who was also rude, and who offered to bring out another dessert with a candle. I advised him that we already ate the dessert. He did not offer to do anything else. As we were leaving, the waiter came over to the table (because the manager told him to) and “apologized” saying that he knew it was my daughter’s birthday, but he forgot about it. I told him I did not accept his apology and he rudely commented that “then it’s on you”.  In addition, the restaurant touts a price fixe lunch. When we were seated we only received the regular menu. Only after I asked for the pre fixe menu, was it given to us. I observed that no other tables were given the pre fixe menu. The restaurant was not crowded and there is never an excuse for poor, rude service. Needless to say, we will never patronize this restaurant again.

The appetizers on the Restaurant Week menu were especially good and creative.  We’ve been going to Maiella for many years, celebrating both big events and for just a pleasant evening, always enjoying a tasty meal.
Tonight was a big disappointment from beginning to end.
When we arrived, we were ignored at the front desk while the hostess had a discussion with one of the managers - not even a “Hello, we’ll be right with you.”
Once seated at the table the service was very slow.  It took about an hour between appetizers and main course.  And what a disappointment the main course was!  The scallops entree was comprised of small scallops more appropriate for an appetizer.  The plate was “decorated” with a few leaves of arugula and runny dressing.  Unappetizing.  The steak was not great in flavor and was accompanied by a bunch of dry arugula without any dressing.  The side of roasted potatoes were cooked without salt - they were quite bland.
We were left sitting with dirty plates for quite a while.  They had plenty of bussers but our waitress was missing.
We asked - they said they were not short- staffed tonight.

Even better than other Rosa M locations in the city.  But very noisy and hard to have an 'intimate' conversation.  We were sat in the basement - between the boiler room and the toilets.

Nowhere does it say there is a difference between the “$5” margs and the normal ones. We requested margaritas and the waitress did not give or even offer the $5 menu, but when given the check we were charged full price ($18 per margarita) and told there is a separate menu for the $5 Monday. Why were we not given or even told about this menu. This establishment is deliberately trying to take money from people by not being clear about their $5 menu.

A few minutes turned into 10 so we sat at the bar to have a drink. We had one drink. Then we had two drinks and it had been ONE HOUR past our reservation time.

Food is amazing..service is good too
Really kind!!!  Excellent knowledgeable service, one of the best steaks I have eaten in a long while (sirloin perfectly broiled and seasoned) and excellent wine. The price was exceptional value.  Our food was either undercooked or overcooked. Our waiter was not very friendly. Have been before and loved it but last night not so much  Business dinner. The Benjamin has a great wine list and the food and service is excellent!!  Several visits to Benjamin and never disappoints.. great steak and service - all round very good  Having had a wonderful experience in Dec 2019 we knew we wanted to come back to Benjamin’s Steakhoue (we arrived a few mins late as we had gone to Prime by mistake) This time our experience wasn’t as great. It felt like as soon as it was known we were tourists (from UK) we had a different experience which was quite disappointing. We felt a little ignored at times as the two tables either side were Americans so the servers / manager attended to their tables more so than ours. Regarding our food we ordered the fillet mignon medium rare amd a very well done. Steamed broccoli and a baked potato with shredded cheese on the side. Our server got our order wrong. The baked potato was to share and it came out with our steaks with the cheese melted on it. I can’t eat cheese hence asking for it on the side. We called our server and explained it was not right to which he said he remembered how we had asked for it. Our server took it away for and we waited almost ten minutes for the baked potato and shredded cheese to come back, so we had steaks and broccoli to start with… The overall service wasn’t that great to be honest compared to how we witnessed other guests were being treated. A family of four to one side had the manager / front of house person give them a totally different experience to us by chatting  suggesting desserts for their kids and just making them feel special. He said nothing to us and as tourists from the UK it made us question why we didn’t get the same experience. The three on the table the other side again had a different experience with a couple of servers making conversations so this left us feeling a little unappreciated. On a positive our steaks were cooked exactly as asked for and were amazing along with the bottle of red wine. We plan to visit NY again in a few years but not sure there will be a third visit to Benjamin’s Steakhouse.

I took an exceptional wine and they didn’t allow me to drink it, even after I offered to pay a cork fee.
Martinis and Negroni were not good. Too watery.  Excellent service, incredibly delicious food and great wine. A gem.  To start with, this is a restaurant of high-class and caliber, where almost all of the men are wearing  jackets and some even with ties, and high cost, even for NYC and the Upper East Side. But it's not a particularly joyous or even remotely fun place to dine at, except what seems to be for a largely senior clientele, which looked like regulars and appeared to love it. Water-stained ceiling spots towards the back and plastic covering around an air conditioning duct gets a big demerit but kind of goes with the baseball cap look a few very casually dressed men were sporting, and was not consistent with the generally attractive decor and the  modern art on the walls. Tables nicely spaced. The serious Northern Italian food coming out of the kitchen is very good, as is the service, with a plethora of servers roaming the room, and at these prices they should well be. But the servers are largely a bland,  serious type with no personality that so often makes  diners paying a ransom feel a lot better about the experience. Wine by the glass prices are really over the top, and the full selection and pricing by the bottle is way out of bounds in this age of many, many hundreds of good and fairly priced alternatives that are available at non nose-bleed prices, but those wines many diners of good taste and high standards would prefer do not pay the rent. Read more I had the most wonderful quail I’ve had in years. Perfectly done and delicious.  Excellent restaurant.  Fantastic food.  Amazing service.  Nice wine list, thank you!  When we sat down our waiter (who I saw across the room) checked his watch ( it was 8:43 pm) and rolled his eyes. We then had 3-4 waiters try to collect our food. One waiter just stood there as we ate (so uncomfortable) and reached across my face as I took a bite to get a plate. We couldn’t eat or drink in peace here. It was so obvious how badly they wanted to move us along at a luxury restaurant for our birthday celebration.

My branzino was so poorly filleted that I had to pick out 8 huge bones. The guy who filleted it then replaced my plate as I picked the bones out to hide them from the waiter.

He didn’t bother to check on us one time which caused us to ask the busboy and others to request items we needed such as plates, sauces etc. The fluke was pretty good but the accompanying potato side was underwhelming. Ordered a $16 s’mores dessert which ended up being a large scoop of vanilla ice cream, 2 marshmallows, 2 stale graham crackers and not enough chocolate sauce. Underwhelming. The music was great and the restaurant is beautiful.  The maître D was kind and amazing. ￼ Read more Vibe was good—though a bit loud for my old lady ears—and service was great! Not sure if this is an overall NYC thing or just the price of ingredients these days, but everything was about 10-20% higher than I would have preferred (and I don’t mind spending $$$ on high quality food).

Food is excellent. Brought a party of 7 last time with a client. Food was excellent and consistent. Service was incredibly slow and lacked the excellence of the food and ambience. Didn’t get our food for a very long time, possibly 40 minutes. And the enthusiasm and checking could be improved. Read more While I was disappointed with the Japanese breakfast, I appreciated the manager trying to make things right. The miso soup was incredibly salty to the point where it’s nearly inedible (there were a few other problems including the Japanese pickles tasting old/stale, among other things). We got to exchange the soup for something else on the menu, and I appreciated the gesture. I know that Point Seven just started their breakfast service, and I want them to succeed. I really hope they continue to tweak and improve their recipes! Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/55857670.webp

We should’ve known better as upon arrival at 8pm on a Friday night it was almost completely empty. The only redeeming quality of L’Adresse NoMad was our server. She was very attentive.
The $40 hamburger was a premade shaped burger with truffles on top. So I guess we paid for the tiny shaved truffles because there was nothing special about the burger. My husbands thin Kroger looking steak was served  on a blank no frills white plate with a small dish of sauce.

---

nt**

We visited L'Adresse last night for dinner, a party of four, with high hopes for a delightful meal. Unfortunately, our experience didn’t quite hit the mark. We started with a wine plate which was essentially a charcuterie, and then moved on to our main courses: prime rib, risotto, and a salmon with rice dish.

The prime rib was a letdown, lacking in both flavor and presentation—it was just meat on a plate with a scant condiment that didn’t add any value. The risotto was passable, but nothing memorable. Thankfully, the salmon and rice dish did manage to meet our expectations, providing a savory highlight in an otherwise underwhelming meal.

Our drinks, the French 75s, also fell short, not living up to the standard we anticipated. Overall, the dining experience at L'Adresse was not worth the money spent, given the subpar food and drinks.

Good place but need to be selective on what you order. My veal scallopini was precooked....I know they're busy but really....only takes a few minutes to cook veal.

I had the veal scallopini which rivaled my own. Delicious. My husband had the penne vodka and it was true to its origin. Don’t skip dessert! So so good! Looking forward to the next time! Read more I am very disappointed.  The Carbonara was laden in heavy cream.   It did not say cream on the menu as a traditional carbonara is only made with egg.  The server offered to remake it but we didn’t want to wait. It was so heavy.  The menu is heavy with cheese and fat.   Would not go back. Read more This is, without question, one of my favorite NYC restaurants! The service is wonderful..the food portions large! Try the Chicken parmigiana!

I have been going to Trattoria DellArte for many years since it around the corner from my office for meals which have been very good but last night was a disappointment. The food came out cold and the presentation was poor. we had a 6pm reservation we were seated at 6:40 and was forced to eat quickly due to having to get to theater. They may have been understaffed and frankly, i have never seen such a line to get seated.  that said, I will return because one blip doesn't destroy a long positive history.

Food was delicious, the view was amazing! Would def come back next time I’m in NYC  I made a reservation at this place a month out from the evening in which I had hoped to dine. The night before the reservation, the restaurant cancels on me due to a “private scheduled event”. In the email where I’m notified, they offer to help me book a new reservation at a nearby spot. I ask them to assist me in finding a new place. They never reply and do not help me. 

This was my experience. Maybe the food is great. Maybe the service is incredible. I don’t know, because they bailed and then ghosted me. Don’t eat here. Read more Difficult to access. Elevator not working on arrival and nobody answers the phone. Required walking 4 flights up, and front door was locked on the way out.

Food was basic for the price point. Not enough staff on for dinner service. The fancy glass ceiling was leaking in the heavy rain.

It’s got a nice view of the Empire State Building influencers will love Read more We had marvelous drinks adviced by the waiter, delicious food like the spicy shrimp and the kebab!  Definitely need to go back. Drinks were phenomenal and the food was great. A little pricy but the ambiance is worth it.  Open table reservation had some issue with the restaurant.  Be sure when you ask for a capachino that it will be cold. The avocado toast made up for it, we enjoyed over all.  Everyone is so accommodating and food is amazing. The ambiance is good too. You get the view of the empire state bldg  The food was amazing & so reasonably priced! Service & ambiance were both outstanding as well.  This spot is a new favorite in the city!  Read more Bien qu OpenTable m a confirmé le numéro de réservation , à notre arrivée notre réservation était inconnu du management.  Showed up and they were closed. Why are you still taking reservations? People travel from far and it’s an inconvenience.  Very chill spot, with a beautiful view of the empire state building. Great drinks and nice staff!  Atmosphere amazing, took a little long to make the mimosas. Chips were salty to my friends but not I, pancakes were not filling I should’ve got the burger. 7/10 overall, I would return though. Music was 2/10 Read more Visited for NYE dinner- very easy to get a reservation, friendly staff and good service. Food and drinks were great with a nice view of the Empire State Building. We had a wonderful time!  We made dinner reservations and after waiting for the waiter to stop his personal conversation with another server, only to find that they may not be offering food on this night because they didn’t have many reservations. The woman who checked us in did not say anything about this but long story short, no dinner was offered. How obnoxious that we were asked to confirm our reservation the day before but no hint of the possibility that we may not be able to get dinner! Lane. Read more Ignored by the server. Appetizer was incorrect. Glasses were chipped. We asked to sit at a specific table and were told “no” although it was empty all the time we were there. Server was non-existent. Read more Took friends visiting from Norway here. The view  of Empire State at night is nice and interesting angle. I had a large group for dinner and the hostess wanted to seat us in lounge chairs. Would have been nice for them to offer to pull a couple tables together as there were enough empty ones. But overall ok for out-of-towners. Read more I’m a super picky eater but loved everything that I ordered. I got the smash burger & the mango cheesecake and they were to die for. The food is amazing, the lounge area is awesome, comfy and well decorated. And you have the perfect view for the Empire State Building! What more could you want. The only downfall id say is the alcohol prices. Specialty cocktails are $20 and if you want just a regular rum & coke it’s $19 … other than that, my first time experience was amazing and I will definitely be returning!! Read more Had an amazing time here! Not sure why but it wasn’t too hectic around 6pm on a Saturday but the vibe was amazing. Music was great and the food was delicious. The view of the empire was a beautiful touch. Read more Read more Would not recommend unless you really just want to take some cute photos. Food is ok. Mimosas are not so good. They use a lot of ice when making their pitchers and it just waters down the whole drink. Considering how much you pay that is ridiculous. The servers were good for the most part but seemed to be a little annoyed when our concerns were brought up (understandably). When we mentioned the drinks being watered down the server immediately reached for the cups asking if she should take them away instead of offering an alternative solution. Cute rooftop place but would not go again. Definitely overpriced. Read more The location is lovely (with a great view of the Empire State building), but it's fairly pricey for what it is.  Also, please be prepared for the AUTOMATIC 20% gratuity on your bill, regardless of how small your group is.  Check your bill carefully or else you might end up adding another gratuity on the blank TIP line that show up with your credit card slip.  The service was fine, but an automatic gratuity for a small party (2 people) is very presumptuous. Read more The ambience was very pretty, from tables to outside seating and dish ware. We were greeted by a lovely host. Our server only checked on us twice when we ordered our food & drinks. We were not checked on after that, when he gave us our check he just put it down and didn’t say anything. Granted he was the only waiter but there were only 5 tables, 2 he served prior to us sitting down. My cauliflower burger was tasty but extremely small portioned. My friend got a “flatbread” pizza, it was not flatbread. The drinks were okay. The music was nice it brought you back to 2005-2013. Also there was a 20% gratuity automatically added to the bill & we were a small group of 3. To be honest, I wouldn’t have given a 20% gratuity because our service simply was not amazing. Read more It was my first time at this establishment and I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere was cute, chic, and quite lovely. The staff was attentive and the food was delicious. I ordered the pancakes and loved them! They were pink with gold flakes. Very fancy! I highly recommend this place. Read more The service was pretty terrible no one ever came over to check on us. We had ordered a burger and the bun was super burnt yet the cheese was COMPLETELY unmelted. The waitress tried to gaslight us about our missing potatoes and when they finally came, they were burnt. Super disappointing. The place has potential and is cute but it isn't worth your time. 

Overall food quality is subpar and not worth any dollar over $20. Bottomless is only as bottomless as the servers are attentive — def not. Read more Service was not great. Check was wrong and food was ok. Would only go again for the ambiance.  The food was great and the staff too. Our server was very polite  Great rooftop with ample covered and open spaces. Covered spaces are all glass (as the name implies) so I assume it would be a great place during winter as well. Very cozy seating, sofas, tables for two or larger . Very friendly but courteous service, great drinks that they custom made if you're ready to describe them. Loved the beef sliders and also the chicken kabob, cheese plate could have been better. Great location mid town near transportation. Empire State Building is a real nice back drop especially when it's lighted. Read more Amazing rooftop, good food and beautiful ambiance!!  Excellence from beginning to end. We were kindly greeted and seated. The timing from seating to hosting was perfect. Rachel (our hostess) explained the menu and took our drink order. I didn't get the Bartenders name, but we will call her ""Awesome"". Rachel always kept a smile and took our appetizer and dinner orders with acceptable timing. Our meals came out with equally acceptable timing. Hats off the chefs who took great care in both preparation and presentation. The food was among the best I've had in the city. The service was among the best I've experienced anywhere. The manager, Allie (forgive if misspelled), checked on us TWICE to make sure we were happy and satisfied. I love when managers do a great job of making me feel important and that my business matters. When my wife and I return, I feel like we won't return as patrons , we will return as family.

Our second time here after a very favorable experience a few weeks ago.  Again, everything - the food, wine, service, and ambience were delightful.  We were a group of six and mostly shared (there are vegans, pescatarians, and omnivores in the group) a variety of small plates, flatbreads, and several desserts as well as both white and red wines.

Unfortunately, OpenTable for some reason decided the reservation was not eligible for points. Read more Great spot that I just encountered. The vibe is great.  The Red Stache is the perfect escape from the city. With super cozy ambiance, amazing wine selection, and a fantastic menu, this little hole in the wall really comes alive to welcome you in and say, ""hey, you belong here."" The mulled wine and shaved brussle sprouts are not to be missed, but the team there is so knowledgeable and help you make any other food or beverage decision you might be struggling with. I have been to hundreds of places in the city, but this new spot is topping my list at the moment. Go go go! Read more By far the least impressive meal we’ve experienced at Hell’s Kitchen. The deviled egg croquettes were decent, but the meatballs and chicken tenders were excessively dry. The lack of a proper kitchen, relying on an oven and microwave near the bar, resulted in a taste akin to reheated frozen food. Despite the friendly and attentive server, it’s doubtful this restaurant can thrive relying on its culinary abilities. The wine list, with bottles ranging from $60 to $700, feels mismatched considering the food quality. Read more Read more The bartender on Wednesday night was such a sweetheart.  WOW - you should definitely go here - very creative and good !!!  This place is not going to make it. Poor selection of wines with nothing special at all. Food was reheated in a microwave and worse than airplane fare. Server was nice , only positive feature.  Super cozy wine bar, with super friendly and attentive service, and excellent food / small bites.  I just didn’t like the Christmas music and the charcuterie portions were a little small, but overall love this place  Great to have our neighborhood wine bar back.

Ellie was a great server!  I cannot say enough about the level of happy we felt yesterday, upon being late for a Broadway performance (heavy traffic) and Nizza holding our table of 6 people so that we could have dinner before heading over. We ordered various pizzas of all kinds and they were ALL better than the ones we've eaten in Italy. The vibe was wonderful, the service was quick and they accommodated all our needs. The hostess was a love, the waitress was lovely and fast, and we had absolutely not a single complaint. Most importantly, the food, including all the desserts, was AMAZING.

Simple menu - they know what they do well and it translates to great experience  Everything was good, but $6 for bread? That was a deal breaker  Good food but small portions for the price! Very stingy on the amount of mussels and fries not included! I’ve never had mussels w/out fries accompanying it! $28 for classic mussels and another $9 or $10 dollars for fries! Not a good value for $38 Read more Neighborhood go-to and love the Thai curry mussels  Great happy hour, really enjoyed sitting outside. Delicious this mussels and oysters in the happy hour, great prosecco as well.  We felt rushed throughout our meal, even though we had a 5:30 PM reservation and there were a number of tables available.

The mussels were shriveled and overcooked which was obviously disappointing. It seemed like they cook the mussels ahead of time and then just dump the sauce over them. Given that this is the main meal they serve, the mussels should have been perfect.

I might have been a little happier to pay $30 for what I know costs less than $4 a pound if they’d been perfect.

Service top notch  We have eaten at the Smith-Lincoln Center often because it has very good food and excellent service - example, at this visit, we had only an hour to spend before the opera due to the timing of an earlier event. We told our waiter the first time he came to the table and he got us out in an hour! The food was very good (though wine pours are a little small). I would have given a 4+, but the noise level is ridiculously high, much more than on previous visits, possibly because this was a Saturday and we’ve usually been there on weekdays. Our conversation, such as it was, was like the telephone game. We would say something close to the ear of the person next to us who would then pass it on to the next person, so mostly, we just ate.

Noisy (better in the back room) but surprisingly good food for a quick meal before or after Lincoln Center.  They were great with our food allergies and the food was delicious!  Restaurant took over 30 minutes to seat us for a birthday meal despite our reservation. Once seated, service was very slow.  Really wonderful experience with the staff cooking a meal for one of our kids who has severe food allergies.  Good food and menu choices. Fun atmosphere. A bit noisey but pick your spot. Maybe in a corner.  Wonderful brunch!!  Love the potato waffle Benedict with salmon.  Food was good for the most part, except the greasy Brussels Sprouts.  Service was as good as it could be in the very crowded section of the table we were sitting it.  It was noisy, though not due to music being pumped out at some ridiculous volume, and I appreciated that.

3. The Passionate Berry Pop Rocks started out tasting really appealing but as the passion fruit sorbet cube started to melt, it became overly sweet sludge.
We also tried three appetizers :
1. Crab Cakes-there are 4 about the size a ￼regular sized marshmallow. The coating was grainy and crab was mushy.

The zucchini pancakes had a nice sauce but more chewy and dense. The greens that came with both appetizers looked wilted. 3 stars for the appetizers. The branzino fish was very nicely cooked and the garlicky green beans side was also good (4 stars for both). We tried the Greek white wine by the glass which were okay. Great atmosphere but would not return for the food. Read more Great place for a business meeting or a family meal. Great food and service.  My favorite new-ish neighborhood spot. Great food. Reasonable-ish prices.  Terrible Greek salad, terrible pita, and over priced. I won’t be back  Terrific little restaurant. 5 stars for saying on menu what is Dairy Free(necessary for my daughter).

Read more The quality of the food and especially the service has worsened since the last time I was there in July. And the prices are way up.  Overall, a positive experience. Didn't like that charcuterie boards were clearly listed on the menu & then not available upon ordering - need to make sure that the menus are accurate & up to date. Would also suggest that they offer daily specials. Read more Always good food and attentive staff. I’ll recommend this restaurant to everyone.  An attractive, smaller scale midtown restaurant, all in stylish white. The Mediterranean food was good but on the whole not exceptional. Fish is hard to cook, and the red snapper was a bit dry and over-grilled. The place was not busy but the service seemed a little disorganized, out of focus, although the staff was friendly enough. Read more My wife’s birthday  Overall, it was a pretty good experience for my partner and me. We were celebrating a belated Valentine's Day, and the waitstaff all made it very sweet. They were willing to allow us to choose a seat ahead of time. The food was pretty good, but not the best that we've ever had. We're from Los Angeles, so we were prepared for some higher prices in New York City. However, we still felt like the price a little high based on the service and the quality of food. Also, abiance-wise, the restaurant was in a hotel that seemed a little lower quality and an odd fit with the restaurant. Read more Overpriced
Food was mediocre
Service was mediocre  Wonderful Valentine atmosphere and experience for my boyfriend and Is first Valentine’s Day. Wonderful, fresh, and delicious food. Will have to dine again to try more dishes.

Will definitely be going back and taking my friends and guests. Read more The restaurant is pretty and the people are lovely. My daughter is vegan so I thought a Mediterranean restaurant would be a good choice for a pre theater dinner.

Read more Read more The drinks were delicious. As for starters, the Greek salad, shrimp (a little u der cooked) steak fries were all unseasoned, and the hummus was chunky.

The food was great, especially the humus. Although the price of the humus was a bit high for the portion.  Had the grilled platter as well and everything was very good  The service was horrible.  It took us awhile to get water and then it took us over an hour to get our dinner.  We were not sure who our server was.  Would not go back based on the poor service.  We had a great experience from the moment

Great service.  Great menu  **Restaurant Review: Havana Central**

If you're in the mood for a vibrant dining experience infused with the flavors of Cuban cuisine, Havana Central is the place to be! Our recent visit was nothing short of fantastic, and I can't wait to share the highlights.

First and foremost, the food is delicious! From the moment we took our first bites, it was clear that the kitchen takes pride in delivering authentic and flavorful dishes. The Ropa Vieja was tender and savory, perfectly complemented by the accompanying rice and beans. The plantains were a delightful addition, adding a sweet touch that balanced the meal beautifully. Each dish was not only flavorful but also a feast for the eyes, beautifully plated and bursting with color.

The drinks are on point! Havana Central has an impressive cocktail menu that captures the essence of a tropical getaway. We tried their signature Mojito, which was refreshingly crisp and perfectly balanced, and the passion fruit daiquiri, which was a delightful explosion of tropical flavors. Each sip was a reminder of the vibrant atmosphere that the restaurant exudes.

Our waiter was the bomb! He was friendly, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about the menu. He made excellent recommendations and ensured we were well taken care of throughout our meal. His energy added to the lively ambiance of the restaurant, making the experience even more enjoyable.

Overall, Havana Central is a must-visit for anyone craving delicious Cuban cuisine and a fun dining atmosphere. With mouthwatering food, expertly crafted drinks, and stellar service, it’s an experience that leaves you feeling satisfied and eager to return. Highly recommended! Read more This place has a great vibe. Quick friendly service. And the food is absolutely delicious. A must try.  The food and drinks were delicious, the mojitos were very tasty.

Love the food and service but seating was tight and directly next to another party.  Great experience, seating was tight but the vibe was awesome. Food was excellent, being in Times Square, we did not expect the meal to be authentic, we were pleasantly surprised!  Service was great. Good food. Wish plantains were fried more and cut thinner.

This food is no way near  Cuban food.  Food was delicious but it took forever to get 45 mins  Nice place and atmosphere, food ok - meat better than vegetarian. Avoid Ramon as a server - failed to bring water (twice) and then we got charged for a cocktail we hadn't ordered. Poor attitude. Read more Food was soggy and the burger with chorizo was dry  I go to Havana Central frequently, usually in the evenings. This time I went for lunch and I was disappointed. The food was cold and the appetizer was  not fresh. The server was fantastic and immediately took the food to heat it up. However, it was still cold.  Good but cold. 

I want to say that I hope this was a one time situation as Havana Central typically has great food and great atmosphere and I would like to continue to frequent it.

We came on a Saturday night and the ambience was immaculate, the food was incredible, and the drinks delicious. We had the branzino, orecchiette, and verdure.

I can't recommend this place enough for anyone looking for a great dining experience. I'll definitely be returning! Read more I had the worst experience I’ve ever had in a NYC restaurant tonight. It started with them not having a table and continued once we agreed to sit outside with unforgivable lack of service. No food after one hour. Not even a bread basket or an olive. No explanations. The woman at the desk was completely unapologetic and condescending. We were repeatedly told the kitchen was trying a new menu!! I saw tables walk out, people loudly complaining about the lack of food and service.  I’ve never witnessed such a total restaurant meltdown.  Everyone was miserable.  I will never step foot in this restaurant again and would recommend others spare themselves the pain. They exist simply because of their proximity to Lincoln Center. If I could give them no stars that would be my rating. Read more  We arrived for a 545 dinner and were not seated until 6. Getting a San Pellegrino took 20 minutes and drinks 40 minutes later. Food never came. Supposedly short staffed in kitchen but super slow bar service cannot be explained. Ruined our night. Won’t be back. Read more It was a horror show.  Food was simply not coming out of the kitchen; behind the glass walI, I was able to see the expediter, who looked frantic.  We received our entrees over an hour after sitting down; we left without dessert because it was obvious that we wouldn't get food in time to make a 7:30 performance next door at Geffen Hall.  (We had budgeted two hours for our meal.) Our server was minimally competent, and seemed to have difficulty understanding our food orders (did I mispronounce ""rigatoni""?)  A glass of wine ordered with the entree did not arrive, and he had to be reminded.  It was difficult to get our check.  

We were surrounded by other tables in similar distress -- we saw diners complaining vociferously to the waiters and their captain.  Some people simply walked out; it was obvious that there were other tables who gave up on dessert and demanded their checks as soon as their entrees arrived.  

I have eaten at the Lincoln a number of times in the past, and never had such a bad experience.  I will not go back. Read more We arrived for a 5:00 PM reservation. We were served at 6:35 PM. We had 15 minutes to eat before a 7:00 PM curtain.
The food was overly salted. I won’t be back.  This was perhaps our 10th time at Lincoln and our experience was awful.  We arrived 2 hours ahead of our LCT curtain and told the waiter our curtain time.  The food took forever to arrive.  We got our main courses after we had been there about 90 minutes and had to forgo dessert.  We got no apology and no explanation.  My appetizer was a terrible salad swimming in a gloppy sauce and my main course was a piece of fish with nothing else except a dark, heavy sauce suitable for a steak, perhaps, but not white fish.  Many people sitting around us were also without food and some just left without eating. Read more great food and service, and so convenient for any performance at any one of the Lincoln Center theters.  I am usually very happy with this restaurant, but the kitchen was off tonight. We received the wrong appetizer and then had to wait for our main course until 30 minutes before our show was supposed to start so that we had to eat our dinner much faster than we would have wanted to. they are usually much better about that. Read more The place was more than half empty, but we were forced by the hostess to sit at a table for two. When we left there were still plenty of of empty tables for four that had not been occupied and obviously had not been reserved.  The waitstaff service was very good.

The food was amazing!!
Can’t wait to come back  It’s lovely and quiet but there is very little to accommodate someone who lactose intolerant or allergic. They were able to adapt one primo piano (pasta course) and had NOTHING for dessert - how hard would it be to have Italian ice or sorbet in a few flavors.

Can’t wait to go back. Read more We made a reservation for restaurant week but I found the wait staff to be quite nice but the service slow. I ordered the crab cab as a starter and it was primarily filler. I ordered the steak panino as a main course but it was not the medium that I asked for, in fact it was burnt and really thin. The mango sorbet was extremely sweet - though my daughter ordered the lemon and it was quite good. 

My daughter liked her meal - she went with the burger, and lemon sorbet.  

We had to wait a very long time between courses. We were there for 2 hours and there were only 3 other tables in use besides our own. At one point my daughter went to find the waiter to ask that they bring out the next course. 

The regular menu seems appetizing but based upon my experience with Restaurant Week fare I doubt I'd go back to try it. Read more our dinner was incredible, but the lasagna is out of this world. we will definitely go back just for that dish  The food was really good, the service as well!

We made reservations an over a month in advance. When we arrived, they sat us near the door and under the DJ speakers. We could not speak to each other. They did not control the crowd at the don’t desk. Patrons continuously leaned on our chairs and our backs as they waited to be seated. We were polite and we did ask for a different table. We were informed no one wants this table. Food was good, but meals were wrong. Unfortunately, we will not be going back next year. We will however continue to have meals in their sister restaurants.

Our appetizers (for the table) were calamari fritti, Caesar salad and arancini.  All were delicious. Each of us enjoyed something different, Vodka rigatoni, gnocchi, lasagna and (shared) fettuccini with scallops (special). a little sparse on the scallops. Desserts were splendid with Tiramisu, Chocolatissimo and cheesecake and a birthday tiramisu also! Great for a family dinner but a bit pricey (but what isn't these days.) Highly recommend.

This was my second time with you Guys, I absolutely loved the first time so I had to come back again of course! Food overall was a 10/10 everyone enjoyed it!  Totally exceeded my expectations. Whenever I return to Long Island City I'll be sure to revisit!  Lovely rooftop restaurant with amazing view of NY skyline, looks magical at night.  Good food options including several vegetarian choices. Cocktails a tad pricey at $18. Surprisingly uncrowded at 8 pm on the Friday of Labor Day weekend.  Glass panels keep out the strong winds.  We had a great time! Read more Excelente servicio y excelente vista de toda la gran manzana  Read more When we arrived at 7:30 pm there were only 2 tables that had guests. All the other tables were available. They sat us immediately and gave us menus. We waited patiently for about 15 minutes. We had to wave down one of the servers to get their attention just to bring us water. There were 3 servers and 2 managers. We finally ordered and the food came out within 10 minutes. The food was mediocre but we were ravenous so it could have possibly been worse. My husband had to get up and ask for salt and pepper shakers because they never brought it to our table after he had asked for it when the food came out. I would say the service was awful but we didn’t receive any so I would give this place zero stars for the service. The tip was already included in the bill which was such a disappointment as they didn’t deserve the 20% gratuity that they automatically tacked on.
The view of a partial skyline was pretty but was blocked glass and fingerprints. Never again. Read more Was looking for a new rooftop to explore and stumbled upon this location. Its inside of a hotel which I didn't expect but no issue with that at all. The hotel entry was nice. Upon entry into the restaurant, I was a little underwhelmed as I expected it to nicer. Again, not an issue. I just think I expected more especially with other rooftops in the area being so beautiful. It was daytime so I can see everything clearly in terms of decor. I am sure at night no one would notice the drab linens or cheap tables and chairs underneath, etc. No big deal just expressing what to anticipate as the website pictures can be misleading. We sat and ordered some cocktails which were good. Now onto the food. NOT GOOD. This is where the deal breaker was for me. I ordered lamb chops and they didn't even taste like lamb. They came out luke warm and very tough despite ordering them rare. It also came with three ""lemon"" potato wedges that has NO taste of lemon, on a plate that looked like it has been through the ringer! Again, had this been nighttime, I am sure no one would see that. Everyone's meal was average or below at best. I am not one to complain about food or return, I just use this as a way to decide if I would return. Now, with all that said, our waitress was WONDERFUL. She was extremely polite, friendly and attentive. When she saw one party still didn't get their food despite us midway into ours (another issue), she offered him a drink and genuine sincere apology. Ironically, his meal was the best on the table. All in all, I give this place a 50/50. Maybe if I didn't expect so much I wouldn't have been disappointed. Glad I tried it, probably won't ever again. Read more I give this place 4 stars not because the food or service was exceptional, but the evening view & ambiance were quite nice! We arrived before sunset & the skyline view was nice, but it got more spectacular at night as the lights came on all the buildings. Plus, the restaurant had a nicer ambiance at night with lights on the tables & hanging twinkle lights. Some people reviewed this place with 1 or 2 stars & I don’t agree. But it’s better to go knowing what to expect. The food is decent (not anything spectacular, but perfectly fine). My cocktail was tasty, a little sweet but nothing crazy; it was the Ocean Blue. I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a sweet cocktail. My husband’s mint lemonade (no alcohol) was way too sweet, tasted like a too sweet mojito with no alcohol. I wouldn’t recommend it as a virgin drink. Our chips & guacamole & drinks came fast. Our tacos took a long time to come but it was ok because we were enjoying the ambiance & view & chatting. Apparently, if you order any hot food, it comes from a downstairs kitchen so be papered to wait a while. But the tacos were good, nothing spectacular but good. If you just want a drink & appetizer with a nice view, this might be the place to go. But don’t expect it to be high end. The service was fine, waitress was nice, moderately attentive, but don’t go here expecting exceptional service; if you go, go for the view. Also, keep in mind the outdoor seating area has a view of the Manhattan skyline from midtown up and a view of Long Island City. If you sit inside you’re mostly getting the Long Island City view, not the Manhattan view. I saw some people complaining about prices in their reviews. I don’t think the prices were anything crazy. $18 for a cocktail in NY is pretty average. Menu prices were average too. I also don’t think it’s a big deal that they add 20% gratuity automatically. A lot of places do this. Come here for the evening view, decent cocktails & food, but don’t expect a 5-star dining experience. Read more Super expensive service was not what I expected food super prices for what we order and without taste, I was expecting much more from this place  Horrible experience. Waitress took our drink order and we put in apps right away. She brings the first round of drinks and we don’t see her again for 20 minutes. The place is not at all crowded and we can see all of the severs and the manager sitting around the bar top talking and laughing. We were looking around trying to get anyone’s attention but no one seemed to care. Finally she comes over again and she’s laughing and literally says “Sorry I was talking with my friends and forgot to come over here.” We order another round of drinks and she asks us if we want to put in any food. We say we’re good with the appetizers we ordered, and we also put in our entree order right away because we realized the service was slow. Another 20 minutes go by and the appetizers are not out but the entree comes out instead. I tell the food runner if he can please call our waitress because we ordered appetizers that never came. He takes the entree back and I watch him go back downstairs to the kitchen without getting the waitress attention. Meanwhile the whole staff is still laughing and hanging around the bar. We finally flag her down and she’s like i’m so sorry about the appetizers the kitchen made a mistake. Let me give you a round of Prosecco on the house to make up for it. We say okay but can we just have that entree back? Because we were so starving at that point. She says no we already threw it away. We said can we just have the check? Minutes later the runner brings the entree back out and drops it on the table. The Prosecco she promised never came but the manager came and dropped two shots on the table without even saying anything. When she dropped the check we asked about the Prosecco and she said “if the manager gave you shots I can’t give you anything else.” Then she drops the check (which had the auto gratuity added) and doesn’t even say thank you or anything. Very bizarre experience. I work in the industry and it’s crazy to see such a blatantly careless staff. Read more High chair should be next to the plants or at least some high chairs. Other that that place is great. Menu could be more choices  Mediocre food - come here for drinks and views. Service was good and attentive. Fun and trendy cocktail spot  It was a little pricey, but it was a great experience overall. The view was amazing at night, and the noise level was pretty low.  Do you really want to go?
Paid nearly $300 with gratitude automatically add on your bill ( whether or not if the service is good or bad)
4 cups of ice water, ( alright refill twice)
2 virgin cocktail,
Shrimp cocktail ( 4 pieces) huh?
3 shrimp taco ( 3 bites) huh?
3 orders of pastas asked if it’s big portions, waitress responded two orders should cover 4 people , guess what it’s not , 3 orders can barley feed 2 adults

I paid $184 up front. At the end of the event the waitress brings me a bill for $55 for two drinks! After speaking to the manager he said that the price includes her tip, mind you I already paid the tip in my $184 and she was charging me again! I don’t like duplicity like that! Read more Read more We had an amazing time, a wonderful view, great service and food.  We came a day when they were preparing for a special event, if I knew that in advance probably wouldn’t have gone that day.  The service was outstanding. Our waitress consistently checked up on us and made sure everything was going well.  Refused to honor a gift card. Poor management. Bad business practice  Great views, great food, staff was fine. No fans or AC in the covered outdoor area made it very hot. Our wine and beer was served warm.  Great food, service and ambience
Also amazing views  The first thing is the waiters forget the orders.
second the food is not good
The worst thing is the drinks, my god, no alcohol. and then they offer to sell you another shot

It seems unfair to me that the prices of the drinks intentionally do not include alcohol so that you buy a shot.

Our waiter, Javier, was a man of few words. He was occupied for a not very crowded hall. He was nowhere to be seen during the meal, but with no words, he put the bill on the table almost right after our dishes were taken away to signal us to leave. My empty glass of water was refilled only once and only after I asked him to when he dropped off the bill. And he responded with a restrained nod. His constant standoffish attitude made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable.

Had a reservation here for dinner on a Friday night prior to going to a Broadway show. Greeted and seated right away. Restaurant has a nice ambiance - on the dimly lit side but romantic feeling. The dining tables are very small.  Wine/Beer menu is small but adequate.  Ordered 3 dishes: PANEER TIKKA SHASHLIK, CHATPATE BAINGAN, and MURGH MAKHANI.  The food came out very quickly and all together.  It felt very ""squished"" to eat on that table.  All the food we ordered was very tasty.  The butter chicken was average - small portion and was expecting a more intensely spiced gravy. The eggplant dish was our favourite. The only other critique I had was that the food could have come out hotter (temperature wise).  With so much restaurant competition in Manhattan there is room for improvement with Moti Mahal Delux. Read more This was a great find to introduce Indian food to non-American friends. Tried golgappa shots, reshmi murgh, butter chicken, saag paneer. Everything was so well presented with just the right amount of flavor and spice! Will come back again! Read more Restaurant is not well maintained.  Dirty white towels on floor to soak up leak.
Shoddy service. Slow. Poor English fluency.  
Although we indicated a desire to take all leftovers home, server kept 3 sauces. Read more The food was well prepared, the service was excellent but the menu was more limited than I remember.  The appetizer choices should be expanded, only 4 not very thrilling ones, and some favorites were missing from the menu..  However, I'd still go back. Read more Nice service. I had lamb shank. It was tasty but very small serving.  Overcooked chicken, overcooked nihari, overcooked mutton. Appetisers were okay  It’s incredibly sad in a city of such good people to have a restaurant so utterly incompetent when it comes to their staff. The staff was rude and disrespectful to our party which included an elderly woman with a disability. Will not go here again. Sad, because the food was pretty tasty.

We also serve brunch on Saturday and Sunday's with a great bottomless prix fixe including French Toast, Steak and Eggs, Eggs Benedict and Bloody Marys, Mimosas and Screwdrivers.","Read more Sucha great deal for NYC! Only negatives were salad was a bit boring and steak was a bit too rare but otherwise loved it!  The eggs Benedict is how I judge each restaurant on the brunch level - I have never run into an issue where the whites are translucent and the manager insists that’s standard and how they are supposed to be and refuses to cook them more. The steak and portabello hash was just ok. The eggs were not eaten as they were undercooked. 

Service was great and the mimosas were delicious and strong. Read more Good experience, the medium rare steak and sauce was very good. Nice service and the price is a good deal !  The food was amazing, and our serve Paul, was great.  We went for brunch and it was very slow when we arrived, and the kitchen seemed to be rushing food out as if it was a busy Friday night.  I received my starter (salad) before my boyfriend received his (parfait) and the same happened with my steak and his breakfast sandwich.  You can tell they have the salad and steak down to a science for dinner as their only items, but they need to slow that down when waiting for other items with brunch.  Overall, it was a great brunch, the food was delicious and the staff was very attentive. Read more We had a great experience with Medium Rare even though it was their opening night, so many people trying to get in and with the kitchen being backed up.  The hostess Hazel had a big smile and accommodated us with ease.  MC :) Read more Service was good.  However, when we showed up, they were surprised as they seem to have accidentally cancelled our large group reservation despite the reservation still showing up here on open table but they managed to gather a large table for us at the far end of the restaurant.  Quality of meat was definitely subpar, waited a long time for food and the bread came out cold.  Food wise was generally very disappointing.  Dessert was too sweet and some of them tasted odd.  Bill was not cheap after adding in drinks and dessert.  Would not recommend. Read more Terrible restaurant, I would not call what they served a steak.  Need to be more specific and clear. We assumed (as first time visitors) the pre fix menu for brunch would mention no second serving of Steak and fritte!
My son who loves steak was disappointed and sad.
The food was amazing, the service was extraordinary.
Every time I finished my “bottomless mimosa” the next glass magically reappeared. But, we assumed that we would get second serving of steak and we did not.
Our service personal was very kind, he brought in a free juice and bloody Mary to keep us happy.
Would definitely visit again. Best steak and the magic sauce that came with it. Thank you Paul, you were exceptional. Read more This was an overall great experience. The food was fantastic. I went for brunch and got the steak frites. The sauce was the highlight of the plate. The brunch portions were perfectly sized and the all inclusive menu itself is a huge selling point and one of the best priced things I’ve ever seen in NYC. Oh and how could I forget, the service was lovely! Everyone was so nice and personable. I will definitely be telling everyone I know and coming back myself.

When we were seated I’m asking the waitress about the food and she says oh they changed the menu which didn’t have too many options, so I ordered some chicharron and tostones, some chicken wings and Mac and cheese and everything tasted like it was reheated from the day before the soda was flat. They had one waitress for all the tables which caused a delay. It was my sons birthday I asked the waitress to bring out a slice of cake, she brings it with a lit candle and plays Stevie wonders Happy Birthday song over the speaker which you could barely hear, it was terrible Read more Bree was a great server and the food as usual was excellent.  Myself and my guest ate at your establishment for the Sunday brunch @11:30am seating , the  waitress Kai M. charged me twice for the 90minute bottomless sangria when myself and my guest had only ordered just the one & “we” was refilling our glasses ourselves!! Back end of story….my guest had originally ordered herself a Virgo something type drink but kindly ask said waitress to cancel it because we decided to get the sangria instead, the said waitress said that’s fine because the bartender didn’t make the drink yet. Food was great though it took quite some time to get that because said waitress didn’t come back in the** 5mins**that I asked her to come back to put in said food order so we didn’t receive our meal until almost 1pm or a little after damn near!!  My grievance basically as I said in the beginning of this post that I was charged twice for said sangria when I should have been charged 1 time. I would have loved to come back to this establishment with some more people but the way this establishment bamboozled me that’s a NEGATIVE! Read more Ive been here several times and I always say the same thing: THE MUSIC IS WAY TOO LOUD!  I’ve come to Beatstro  numerous times and they never disappoint. I don’t have a bad thing to say it was a little quiet for Saturday brunch, but the service and food were on point as usual. Read more Upon entering, the waiting area was very hot and humid I felt really bad for the hostess having to sit there all day. Once we entered the main dining area the temperature changed. As we were walking to our seats water was dripping from the pipes above. Once seated everything was great. The DJ played a mixture of genres and eras. It was extremely loud to the point we were screaming to the top of our lungs to order or talk to each other. The food was delicious! The ambiance was amazing! The drinks were potent! Overall I was pleased. I will be back! Read more Not really the party atmosphere I was hoping for, we were celebrating a birthday, but we did have a good time. Maybe because it was Saturday and during the summer, there was no DJ, the sound system was ok but not great. The vibe was more slow and relaxed than energetic or fun. The food is good and the price / quality is great. Read more Food quality has declined.. Menu should be updated to items you actually have..  Music was so loud, we couldn’t hear each other speak and it was so hot, we couldn’t even drink. Food was good n service.  The restaurant had a speakeasy ambience and the music selection was cool. The service was polite and quick. The food was delicious and the drinks were poured stiff. I definitely plan to return for Brunch in the near future. Read more Read more We enjoyed the ambiance, and the service was really great. Our hostess and waitress were both super sweet. The food was delicious, and the music/decor were spot on. I already want to go back! Read more Victoria was amazing and the chef was prompt with the food  We were celebrating a birthday and what a disappointing experience! There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant. The drinks were horrible, food was “ok”, nothing seem fresh and the service was terrible.
They never mentioned the birthday , when I asked the waitress she said “oh I didn’t see that” but “we don’t comp cakes”. So distasteful! Read more The waffles was underr cooked , mash potatoes was very salty . We has two bills waiter kept over charging us , having items on the bill thar we didn't have . He had to change it three times  My friends and I were thrilled to finally support this Black-owned Bx gem. The vibe was chill, the food flavorful, and the service on point; when a small issue arose with my order, our server immediately addressed it with professionalism & kindness. The only semi-con is that it starts to get lit later in the evening and the music can be excessively loud; aside from that, this is the spot to be. Read more I love this place!! The ambiance is amazing,  the food and drinks are great, and the service is top-notch!!  Atomsphere was good nice family dining.  Drinks were good Banana pudding was top notch.  Cheesecake was homemade.  This place definitely will have you in a vibe with the music and the drinks! I attended a brunch with my man for my birthday and I enjoyed everything about it. I’m also a gamer in a sense that I bring games to brunches to keep conversation lively and although I was able to play with my boyfriend the music level was too loud for that. Needless to say conversations were hard to have BUT the music sufficed there! Good music who needs conversation? Good food, who needs to talk? lol Read more This night was the last out in New York that I would spend with colleagues and Beatstro was absolutely the best b place we could have went!

I bought my Mom for her first experience for Mother’s Day after 6pm and it’s totally different. I thought the DJ would be in the building and the vibe would be the same. It was total opposite. The food took entirely long, I ordered the bottomless Sangria and only had 2 glasses it wasn’t how the waitress comes around at brunch just keeping them coming. My mom said it was ok nothing to brag about and I wanted her to enjoy her day to the fullest however that wasn’t fulfilled. The manager came over to our table a few times to check in and gave us a discount due to the inconvenience. The security guard had me laughing throughout the night which was the highlight other than that it wasn’t what I expected. I wouldn’t recommend or will I come back after 6pm. Sorry not sorry Read more Mac and cheese and other dishes were tasteless, water wasn't served unless asked for multiple times. Need better prefix menu options.  The food was great, a little disappointed that there were some things still on the menu that are no longer served but the stuff we did order was really good. We went on Saturday for brunch at around 1130. It was not busy or too loud, I think Sundays are busier brunch  days. There was only one waitress at the time and about 4-5 tables so it took a little longer to get our orders in and drinks. We got the bottomless brunch and ordered the sangria. Let me tell you!!! Those sangrias were great!! Very strong and super tasty! worth every penny. Our table of 3 went through two pitchers and the tapped out that's how good the sangria was! I would definitely recommend try this spot out. Read more Drinks little pricey and doesn’t pack a lot of punch for the prices … other than that great experience… was pretty empty when I went so the dj was slacking. I understand it wasn’t a packed house but we went for the music experience hence the whole point of the establishment so expectations weren’t meet with that aspect. Read more Service was great, the food was tasty. Very cool aesthetic. Just a lil loud for the purpose of a first date, but definitely would be ideal for a group hang.  The food was delicious,  music was dope and the overall vibe was fantastic.  Went for Saturday brunch. If you follow on Instagram you'd think there would be a full & rambunctious crowd. Apparently that only happens for Sunday brunch, which was a nice surprise. The place itself is really cool, decorated with so much music history. The chef obviously takes pride in his dishes, from the deviled eggs to the locrio (Spanish the on bimbimpop); everything was delicious! Bravo, Chef Harold! The bomb Sangria, which is part of the 90 minute unlimited brunch, is totally worth it. If you plan to drink this, leave the car at home! I cannot wait to go back & try more items on the menu.
Side note: I grew up in this neighborhood & I am blown away by the amazing changes that have & continue to happen to the area. It's so nice to see people bring such diverse businesses to what was once a dilapidated area. Read more Food was amazing, the bartender was on point with the drinks. The Dj was good  I had brunch with some friends. We paid for the unlimited drinks for 90 minutes. Refills were slow initially. We had to ask for pitchers to be placed at the table. Luckily we were accommodated. At other places I have had brunch, the refills are more frequent. Different places, different ways. It's cool. The food though...so good. I'm not sure if the man that brought us our food was the cook, but everything was fresh. Flavorful, nothing over cooked, no complaints. I had a starter kale salad (highly recommend) and I couldn't finish it. The cook had asked if it could have been made better, and I appreciated the question. It means they take pride in their food. The amount for me was a lot. Otherwise it was great. The main reason I give them a three is because my table was kind of rushed out. We were asked if we wanted anything else, and then were presented with the bill.  After we ordered dessert we were told the table was needed 5 minutes before they actually needed the table. We weren't told that there was a time limit at the table. They then said we could finish out drinks at the bar. Some good and some not so good. It's def a vibe, food on point and fresh, and music quiet enough to hear conversations with friends. Read more Beastro is definitely worth the hype. The food is delicious, the small space is nicely decorated as an ode to Hip Hop. Our server was very attentive. The staff did forget one item that was ordered and brought out the wrong dish when reminded. However, they were gracious about it and corrected the error.

I definitely want to go back to try so many things on their menu. The pork riblets, piñon de maduro, yuca fries, and bacon mac & cheese hit in the best way! Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/50069091.webp

The pizza was OK, not super crispy though. The Caesar salad was good but the portion was TINY. Keep in mind it was $17...that's more expensive than the pizza we got. $17 for like 10 pieces of lettuce is kind of insane. It was good but not worth that considering the portion size.

The 280 seat Midtown Manhattan location opened in 1997 at 481 8th Avenue (corner of 34th Street), across the street from Penn Station. Tick Tock Diner has long been known for its American comfort food. Today, it remains true to tradition while offering more dining choices than ever before on its extensive menu, accented with Italian, Greek and Tex-Mex influences. Keeping in the diner tradition, breakfast is served all day, featuring more than a dozen omelets, farm fresh eggs any style, pancakes, Belgian waffles and French toast.","Read more We specifically picked this location because the online menu and the restaurant copy said they had Gluten Free Waffles; they did not.  Hashbrowns were old and greasy.  Chicken fingers were so thick with breading that it made them hard to chew.  Waitstaff was rude.  The best part was going down stairs to the restroom and peaking into the restaurant Butcher & Banker and seeing the old bank vault. Read more Thank you for the waiter for accomodating my request to surprise my boyfriend a birthday cake although they dont do ‘happy birthday’ lettering as what I’ve seen on other people’s post, they went above and beyond by singing him a birthday song instead. The food was ok but the cake wasn’t that good. It taste like leftover cake that’s been stored for a long time (I didn’t get the chance to complain as we were running late on our plans). I was expecting more of the nutella french toast but it seems like they used regular chocolate syrup instead of an actual nutella. Overall it was a good experience being able to dine in one of the old go-to places to eat in New York. Read more The server was very inexperienced and the food was fair at best.  Food was horrendous.  No taste and hard to swallow as it was overcooked.  The waitress never came to ask if everything ok.  Had to ask for straws.  Took our plates and never asked if we wanted anything else.  Had to ask for check figuring the person doing register would question how things were.  Took our money and never said a word not even have a good night.  DO NOT EAT IN THIS RESTAURANT! Obviously they ruined its reputation that they advertise. Read more Good food. Decent prices. Conveniently close to MSG.  Can't remember what the waitress name was but her service was excellent. The food was good but her service made our experience an amazing one. Will be returning because of her!  Honestly one of the worst NYC dining experiences I’ve ever had, and I’m not picky. I’ve actually never left a restaurant review before! 

Our waiter was immediately pretty rude, we had just sat down and asked us if we were ready. The food is overpriced, and not very good. Why is a Beyond Burger served on buttered whole wheat toast?!

Our waiter never checked in on us. He sat down at an empty booth on his phone until a coworker had to flag him down for us. 

The milkshake was pretty good, though. Read more Always have to come here when I come to NYC…….
Great food  food and all service was excellent. place has been around a long time and still top notch!  Our waiter was a bit gruff & insisted his tip be given in cash.  Read more Good value for what you get.   One of the few reasonable priced restaurants we found.  The Tick Tock is a good diner in a convenient location. The food is okay.  The chocolate chip pancakes and the fries were good. The turkey club was terrible. The turkey was extremely dry. Although the place was not at all busy, the service was poor.  I had to make every request repeatedly and always ended up asking someone other than our waiter who was, I repeat, not busy. Read more Celiacs stay away.

Read more Food and service was good.  A little slow getting the check well after our meal was complete.  Great affordable brunch! Service was fast. Food was great.  Cute place in a convenient location  Through many years of visiting NY, we have always enjoyed Tick Tock for their food and atmosphere.  We were staying at the New Yorker and went to Tick Tock for a late supper.  I was looking forward to a simple tuna salad on rye - something I can't get at home.  For some reason they gave me a tuna melt.  When I asked again for just tuna on rye, I got the house special tuna melt with avocado.  At that point, I just ate the tuna salad alone.  But I was very disappointed.  We also had a reservation for breakfast 2 days later.  The service was fun and good - the way I always remember it to be.  The food was mediocre.  Not as good as I remember it to be. Read more This place is over rated . 3 dishes ordered and only the Salad was good . Prawns were greasy and pork tacos cold.  Classic diner.   Very comfortable, friendly and tasty place midtown.  The food was worth it. The service was puzzlingly distracted for the venue wasn't crowded.

Been going to Cafe du Soliel  for many years and have never been disappointed.  Excellent food; wonderful wait staff. We sat outside on a divine nyc late summer evening. Street noise was minimal. This place should not be overlooked.  The omelette was overcooked there was no ratatouille, but you never remembered you don’t offer vegetable milks and the food is overpriced.. the experience was not remotely French. The eggs were tasteless and I will not be going back to this restaurant ￼ Read more Excellent food, great service, great ambience. We sat outside and had outstanding service. Happy hour is also excellent with great drink deals. One of our go-to restaurants in the neighborhood.  No matter what you're eating, get the fries- they are the best (our French family members agree). Read more We had  excellent service and good was delicious .  Always a pleasure - especially for brunch! I’ll always recommend and return.  This is still a neighborhood gem but I was a little disappointed with the food.  Maybe it's because it was brunch?  Dinner always seems to be better quality food.  The service was great and ambiance always lovely on a summer fall day. I'll probably go back for dinner at some point and give it another go. Read more We love the outdoor tables where one can actually converse. Inside most restaurants in NYC the noise level is for people who don't care to hear what others are saying; and this the fase with Cafe de Soleil.

And sitting outdoors on a lovely breezy Sunday afternoon with our guest for four uninterrupted hours was a great luxury. Much appreciated!  The salmon burger and lamb shank were great.

The food, the staff, the atmosphere is top notch.  Delicious food and good service in a casual, friendly bistro.  This is a restaurant that I have walked by many times but never tried and I'm so glad that I did. The food was excellent and prices were reasonable. (We understood that restaurant prices needed to rise during the pandemic, but so many restaurants have never moderated them at all afterward, with the result that we don't go out as often as before.) Best of all, Cafe du Soleil has captured that ""it"" quality that gives it  a convivial neighborhoody feel that makes you know right away that you want to come back -- that's all due to the good service. Highly recommend. Read more I come here often with friends who live nearby. I really enjoy the classic French dishes and cocktails. There are good values in both food and beverages.  I’ve been to the restaurant many times and have had nothing but great experiences. Yesterday however, the food was just okay and the service took forever. Our waiter was lovely but it took way too long to get our food. Maybe because it was Father’s Day?? Read more A french bistro where they know your name and the locals come in and out.  The food's good, the service warm and professional.   What more could you want  So relaxing to sit on a spring night under their protective shed, decorated with French cultural items on the walls to get you in the mood -- to sip wine, dip the endless fresh bread they provide you with in the  pungent garlicky buttery sauce of their escargots, then dig into a Salade Niçoise with generous portions of tuna and sliced vegetables neatly stacked in the bowl, or savor a tender coq au vin. Read more Read more Ate outside to take advantage of the gorgeous weather. Took quite a while for someone to take our order and for our main courses to arrive. They were quick in the appetizer salad tho. There was a large (& loud) party that was there and I think that affected everything. It really felt like we weren’t there.

We both ordered burgers medium-rare. They both came medium to well done after a very very long wait (never a good sign). It took a long time for our server to come over and ask how our order was. By that time we had started eating since it had already taken so long to get our food and we didn’t think we had time for a do-over. Server was apologetic and offered a drink or dessert to make up for it but we didn’t want either. We chose this restaurant over others specifically because we wanted to kick off the holiday weekend with good burgers outside, so it was a disappointing visit. Also, we asked for extra garlic on the fries and there was hardly any garlic at all. The pickle was tasty.

I have never had a stellar experience here but I don’t think I’ve ever had one that was this far off the mark. Server was nice (if overworked) but nothing exceeded or even met expectations. Will not be back. Read more My first date with my now-wife was at Cafe Du Soleil, in May 2011, and we go back there for dinner in May every year.  (We live in another part of the City now, so we don't get to West 104th Street more often.)  One of the wonderful things about this tradition is that it's not just sentimental -- we always have a truly excellent meal.

Always love this restaurant in every way but I do have to say that on this visit it took a very long time for are food to arrive and 2 of the dishes that were ordered rare were made well done! They replaced the dishes so quickly and perfectly that it was shocking! So again, I love Cafe Du Soleil in every way! Read more Always excellent food and service, and a lively atmosphere.

I will not visit there again  I was there with my wife for her birthday before a show.  Dinner was good and service was excellent!.  They do charge for any and everything they give you though.  Even a small extra yogurt was charged on the bill.  But all in all we enjoyed the experience! Read more Food was very good.  I haven't had such sweet tomatoes in a long time.  Noise level is always a problem at the restaurant; but eating in the small room made it a pleasant experience.  $100 for three apps and one entree and one drink (no alcohol). A skinny unsweetened iced tea costs $7 (you pay for refills). Probably the most outrageous prices in NYC.  Great location. Service and ambiance were lovely. Asked that the octopus be grilled well and it wasn’t - not worth sending back  excellent Mediterranean  fare with outstanding service!  This place never disappoints.

Will absolutely be returning  Read more I went during resturaunt week as did many other diners there to be given a regular menu and told that they are not participation in it. I watched a couple literally walk out after.  We felt rushed by the waiters despite the restaurant being half empty. We weren’t even done with our appetizers and the bus boy was trying to remove our plates to give us new plates and silverware for the main course. 2/3 of us got very sick from dinner (not quite sure what dish it was that did it) Read more I will preface this with stating that O was a bartender for 10 years at a fine dining restaurant and my tolerance for busy, cranky, service is pretty high.  We went to Kyma at 5:00 pm and were the only people on the restaurant side for about 30-40 min.  Our server started out really rude and seemed put out by having to serve us.  I order a cocktail and was told that they would not make me one of their dragon queen drinks with vodka instead of gin be ause they already had it premade. At a beautiful restaurant where you pay $20 a drink before tax and tip I would expect to be able to make a simple modification.  When we tried to place appetizer orders we were not allowed to until we knew our dinner order- again this is strange to me- we were not ordering off the prix fix menu- why not let us put in appetizers immediately- we were starving- and wanted to start asap.  The food was OK.  I had the lobster pasta- and it was really sweet- almost like they used sugar instead of salt.  My husband had the seafood orzo.  The ambience was moody and fun- and the place was filled up by 6pm.   For $300 I expect a better experience-  I will stick to AVRA for greek/Mediterranean dining. Read more Excellent food. Price is fairly good, especially for restaurant week. Steaks were really well prepared, octopus appetizer was phenomenal. Amazing service as well!!  Service is great, as well as the vibes.

Whole meal is very enjoyable.  Neighborhood gem!
Always great food.   Always great service. 
Never a bad time.  The food was not good at al — the pita served when we sat down was hard, the octopus made us sick and the French fries were soggy with oil. We spent over $100 a person for lesser quality food than casual Greek restaurants like Souvlaki GR.

The pizza was OK, not super crispy though. The Caesar salad was good but the portion was TINY. Keep in mind it was $17...that's more expensive than the pizza we got. $17 for like 10 pieces of lettuce is kind of insane. It was good but not worth that considering the portion size.

Hubby ordered the margarita pizza. It came out way over cooked - the mozzarella was hardened and without taste. So the pizza tasted like tomato sauce on a crusty pizza dough. And there were no basil leaves on top.  Not like a margarita at all.

Our waiter was immediately pretty rude, we had just sat down and asked us if we were ready. The food is overpriced, and not very good. Why is a Beyond Burger served on buttered whole wheat toast?!

Fast service and tasty food in a clean and pleasant setting. Since we were on our way to an event at MSG all elements to make this a good experience were in place. Would definitely return. Read more Great food, delivered quickly. Very close to MSG where we went for a concert.
Highly recommend for a quick bite of diner food!  Everything was wonderful and the only reason I gave the food three stars was because I am a chef and I know I could make it a little bit better but the presentations were outstanding for a diner. My kids loved it. Had the Nutella pancakes with bananas and berries, and we had a large waffle with berries and chocolate fudge. I had the omelette with fresh spinach and feta cheese. No complaints at all. Our waiter was wonderful and I would definitely go back and I am planning on going back for dinner when I stay at the New York or in the fall.

Been going to Cafe du Soliel  for many years and have never been disappointed.  Excellent food; wonderful wait staff. We sat outside on a divine nyc late summer evening. Street noise was minimal. This place should not be overlooked.

Always a pleasure - especially for brunch! I’ll always recommend and return.  This is still a neighborhood gem but I was a little disappointed with the food.  Maybe it's because it was brunch?  Dinner always seems to be better quality food.  The service was great and ambiance always lovely on a summer fall day. I'll probably go back for dinner at some point and give it another go. Read more We love the outdoor tables where one can actually converse. Inside most restaurants in NYC the noise level is for people who don't care to hear what others are saying; and this the fase with Cafe de Soleil.

And sitting outdoors on a lovely breezy Sunday afternoon with our guest for four uninterrupted hours was a great luxury. Much appreciated!  The salmon burger and lamb shank were great.

The food, the staff, the atmosphere is top notch.  Delicious food and good service in a casual, friendly bistro.  This is a restaurant that I have walked by many times but never tried and I'm so glad that I did. The food was excellent and prices were reasonable. (We understood that restaurant prices needed to rise during the pandemic, but so many restaurants have never moderated them at all afterward, with the result that we don't go out as often as before.) Best of all, Cafe du Soleil has captured that ""it"" quality that gives it  a convivial neighborhoody feel that makes you know right away that you want to come back -- that's all due to the good service. Highly recommend. Read more I come here often with friends who live nearby. I really enjoy the classic French dishes and cocktails. There are good values in both food and beverages.  I’ve been to the restaurant many times and have had nothing but great experiences. Yesterday however, the food was just okay and the service took forever. Our waiter was lovely but it took way too long to get our food. Maybe because it was Father’s Day?? Read more A french bistro where they know your name and the locals come in and out.  The food's good, the service warm and professional.   What more could you want  So relaxing to sit on a spring night under their protective shed, decorated with French cultural items on the walls to get you in the mood -- to sip wine, dip the endless fresh bread they provide you with in the  pungent garlicky buttery sauce of their escargots, then dig into a Salade Niçoise with generous portions of tuna and sliced vegetables neatly stacked in the bowl, or savor a tender coq au vin. Read more Read more Ate outside to take advantage of the gorgeous weather. Took quite a while for someone to take our order and for our main courses to arrive. They were quick in the appetizer salad tho. There was a large (& loud) party that was there and I think that affected everything. It really felt like we weren’t there.

We both ordered burgers medium-rare. They both came medium to well done after a very very long wait (never a good sign). It took a long time for our server to come over and ask how our order was. By that time we had started eating since it had already taken so long to get our food and we didn’t think we had time for a do-over. Server was apologetic and offered a drink or dessert to make up for it but we didn’t want either. We chose this restaurant over others specifically because we wanted to kick off the holiday weekend with good burgers outside, so it was a disappointing visit. Also, we asked for extra garlic on the fries and there was hardly any garlic at all. The pickle was tasty.

I have never had a stellar experience here but I don’t think I’ve ever had one that was this far off the mark. Server was nice (if overworked) but nothing exceeded or even met expectations. Will not be back. Read more My first date with my now-wife was at Cafe Du Soleil, in May 2011, and we go back there for dinner in May every year.  (We live in another part of the City now, so we don't get to West 104th Street more often.)  One of the wonderful things about this tradition is that it's not just sentimental -- we always have a truly excellent meal.  The food is consistently delicious, and the feeling of being transported to France never gets old.  Our dinner at Cafe Du Soleil last night was no exception, and we enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Read more Magnifique love being outside in a bubble by ourselves.  The prix fixe Thursday dinner was a terrific value!!  Great neighborhood spot with indoor and outdoor seating.

Always love this restaurant in every way but I do have to say that on this visit it took a very long time for are food to arrive and 2 of the dishes that were ordered rare were made well done! They replaced the dishes so quickly and perfectly that it was shocking! So again, I love Cafe Du Soleil in every way! Read more Always excellent food and service, and a lively atmosphere.

Located in Midtown Manhattan near Central Park, MOMA, Carnegie Hall, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and Times Square, Smith & Wollensky is the best steakhouse in Midtown Manhattan and New York City.","Read more This place has lost its luster. S&W used to be one of the best steak places. Delicious food, great service and decent prices. Now the food is blah, the service is weak and the prices are high. There are better choices. My advice choose them. Read more It was so great to see Wine Week back with a full house, great service and a nice selection of wines!  El mesero que nos atendió fue pésimo. He ido muchas veces a S&W y siempre ha sido una buena atención. Esta ocasión malísima!!! Lastima.  Great ambience. Easy to make reservations. Delicious food!  Steak is second to none. The appetizers are all very good as well  Excellent . Food and service were of the level you would expect from a 5star establishment  I  love Smith & Wollensky since 1990’s
Whenever I come to New York - US (I am from Istanbul Turkey) I have at least couple of my dinners at S & W…
My last visit there on the 12th. of October (last night) it was very bad experience for me because of the waiter who served us.
Steaks came after one and a half hours ,and cooking instructions were wrong…
I hope next time (I go to S & W again on the 19th. & 28th. of  October)
I hope they recover their services and treat us as it should be.
Regards
Mehmet Germirli Read more The food was not very good, the potatoes gratin were not nice. The place was super busy, although we had a reservation we had to wait 15 min to be seated. Super full of people, too loud inside, tables were packed. I wouldn’t return. I remember years ago this place as a classy, smart, excellent food place, I came with my dad years ago and then again later, I thought I would encounter the same atmosphere, I was wrong. The waiters were very professional though. Read more An underwhelming experience, probably the least favorite meal of our stay. Our party of four was seated promptly in a small four top in the middle of the upstairs dining room.

We ordered the split pea soup and the crab cake as appetizers, and these were the best part of the meal. The soup was good and the crab cake was quite tasty, with good chunks of crab.

We ordered an eight ounce filet ordered medium and the ten ounce filet Cajun style medium rare. The steaks came out much rarer than requested and had zero taste. Should have known it was going to be bland when they left a bottle of their steak sauce on the table without request.

The service was ok. We had ordered a bottle of Dominus and they decanted it, which was a nice touch, but no one came around to refill our glasses. I think they realized they had ignored us, so they brought over two desserts for our table when we asked for the check.

Probably better choices for steak in the city. Read more The food was excellent and the staff truly knows what they are doing. I had the cajun rib eye which was good--the seasoning is a bit heavy so be warned. Wife had the filet mignon which was quite delightful. Strawberry cheesecake (good humor) was really really really good, it was nostalgic as I grew up eating that as well. Ambiance I think I was expecting a bit more, and there was a rowdy group of guys eating their side of cow for the week near us, so intimate setting is not here, but that's okay! Read more Read more As always S&W was fantastic.  The food was amazing, the service perfect, and the ambiance really welcoming.
I’d give this place a 5+ stars!  Excellent in every way we really enjoyed our reunion  He estado numerosas veces en este restaurante y cada vez mi experiencia ha ido a peor.

So sad to see a formed great place having a bunch of issue especially regarding food. Plate cold or overcooked.  perfectly organised, excellent steaks and wine, very friendly personel  The food is very good but a little to much for my taste. It is quantity over balance. It is also to much cheese.  Paulino our waiter was excellent, very attentive and professional  Smith & Wollensky is an outstanding restaurant.  The food is the best and service is attentive and professional.  I strongly recommend them to everyone.  Good experience overall, not fantastic.

Outstanding. Read more My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here. Food was excellent, the service was excellent. We will always be eating here when we visit New York!  S&W is always a pretty solid option. I’ve probably eaten there five times this year because you can usually get a last minute table. I always get the wedge salad and dessert options are great. The waiters are really friendly and nice and service is pretty good overall. Read more We had a wonderful evening with great food  and excellent service. The perfect place to celebrate our anniversary.  The food is always very good. I had this time a very good prime rib. I know the lobster is also wonderful!  Delicious food and attentive wait staff! The filet mignon was perfect.  Looking forward to our next visit.  Always fantastic!! Favourite spot to have dinner in NYC. Steaks are amazing, cocktails  are excellent and our sister Louis was excellent.  We had dinner at this restaurant on the first of October. It was amazing! Benny was our waiter and he was so understanding and friendly. He was the best part of the evening. My wife had a steak and I had the salmon. Yes I know salmon at a steak restaurant? My wife wanted me to change to steak but I am not steak tolerant. So Benny was very understanding about the situation. He gave us space to discuss and decide.
I am very grateful to Benny for his patience and tolerance.

Special thank you to Luis for the wonderful service and complimentary treats as well!

Waiters aren't to attentative. Another thing was the hookah. They literally charge $30 every refill . They said they only refill Flavors not coal .

But my friend and I saw the coal used was the circle ones. (Which don't last long )hence repaying so much every refill. . I would suggest using the square ones that last longer. And at least offer one or two free refill of coal ... Or ,$5 or something .

Maybe even try a new hookah company to connect with. Read more Definitely now a brunch fave ....food was amazing, the vibe was right and the service was great!!!!!!  The place is definitely a vibe. Only issue I had is they wanted me to pay 20 per person at the door that’s tacky as many people that come to this place you shouldn’t be shaking ppl for money at the door. You said nothing about this prior to booking. Read more Loved my experience here. Only thing is although I had a reservation.. and I arrived 30 mins early on a Saturday , I had to pay to get inside the restaurant because of an event that was going on. Allegedly since I made reservations same day, the reservation doesn’t show in their system .. the guy at the door said  “the best he could do was charge 20 instead of 30 per head” since we had a reservation.

I assumed perhaps they cooked the steak more and just accepted it, but I was wrong. The steak was still pink and when I now bought it to the managers attention, he focused on the fact that I already ate one out of the two pieces of steak. They didn’t accommodate nor cared to correct their mistake AGAIN. The music and sangaria was good but their service and food sucked!! Read more I can't rate Skinny's service/food etc. because I was unable to even get in the restaurant despite having a reservation. I understand it was Cinco De Mayo and I expected them to be busy, but I didn't expect to see at least 30 people on the line to get in. When I advised the doorman I had a reservation he told me I had to make the line. If I had waited on line I probably wouldn't have got in until about 7 pm. obviously missing my reservation time which was at 5. I think this is a day where they should not have taken reservations because clearly it was first come first serve if everyone had to wait on line. I probably will not be back. Read more Our reservation was never honored and we’re asked to stand in line because it was “cinco de mayo” 45 mins in the rain and still never made it inside. We left.

I had steak and eggs and had to return my food because I ordered a fried hard egg and got scrambled instead. I sent it back only for it to come out wrong a second time! A fried hard egg doesn't have yolk coming out but that's what I got and I did not eat it. The potatoes' were very greasy and came out a little cold.

Will definitely go back there soon  I was really looking forward to eating at Maria Mulata. Went with a friend who is Colombian so figured that would be a good judge of the food. Overall, the experience was good. The restaurant is decorated really cool with a lot of design nods to Colombian culture. Both the server and bartender were fluent in Spanish which my friend appreciated, and offered some different recommendations.  We tried the ceviche, arepas, and the bandeja paisa. All of the food was good, but I would say not great. I was expecting a very flavor packed selection and honestly, the food was pretty bland.  I think it would be great if the flavors could have been developed better.
Not a bad experience, just not sure I will be going back. Read more The food was tasty and the presentation pretty.
The waiter was attentive, and the chef came out at the end to say hello and introduced himself.
The fish dishes were very small. Not enough for a meal. My cazuela was delish, but not the typical Colombian soup. In fact, it was not a soup but more of a casserole. I was there with a larger group and some of the dishes or ingredient within the dish, were not available for members of the group. They had to be supplemented.

La comida estuvo deliciosa y caliente. El servicio y el trato fue espectacular. Les felicito  Vey very nice. Would definitely go again. For a 4.7 rating was expecting something special from the food, like I’d find at a M 1*  Service was very slow because they were full and understaffed. Their AC wasn’t working and they don’t have fans so it was very hot and stuffy. The waiter said their AC hasn’t been working for weeks. They should said that when people make reservations to warn about the heat. Read more Not worth paying for food that happens to be frozen, not freshly made.  We were a group of six and we ordered shareable appetizers and tamales to share. Food was great, as were drinks. This place is new to the neighborhood; glad to have this unique addition!   The food portions and the flavor were subpar. The lomo was the only part of our meal that was good. The service and the music selection needs to be improved.  The waiter was exceptionally nice and willing. They were out of the requested wine and had no salmon that was on the limited menu. My friend then ordered a chicken caesar salad, which had no parmesan and pieces of chicken with torn skin on top. When she ordered coffee, we were informed the machine was not working. All in all, it was a shame because the waiter was so professional and willing.
Hopefully, they will do better next time, as everyone deserves another chance… Read more Overpriced mediocre food. Service was very slow and dishes were average at best  The service and drinks were very good. The food was also very good but I wish they offered the paella for dinner.  It was really nice.

First, if you aren’t a small person, it’s wildly uncomfortable. Food has great potential but missed this night. They also asked us to move our table in the middle of service. Won’t try again but hope they get it together. Read more Delicious, interesting food and the nicest staff. Will make it a repeat spit  Excellent service! A neighborhood favorite. Cocktails, wine and dinner are all tasty.  If I were on a beach in Colombia I'd be thrilled. The ceviche in particular was quite good. Unfortunately this restaurant feels like a basic Lexington Ave. diner trying to be fancy- with fancy prices too- but velvety fabric on the banquettes and fancy table lamps (with rabbits on them?) makes it feel inauthentic. I would have preferred a simple Colombian decor. It's a place with solid local fare pretending to be something it's not. Read more We loved this restaurant!! Staff were friendly and made helpful recommendations, ambiance was pretty, food and drinks were delicious! Definitely would recommend   Prices are high for quality of food and service. Disappointed.  This place is beautiful .. great service and excellent service. Give it a try.  This new restaurant is pretty good - I would give it a 3.5 if I could - with room for improvement. We enjoyed our main dishes, the chicken and the prawns, but the empanadas we shared to start were mediocre. Service is OK, the waiters need some training. For example, weren’t offered a taste from our bottle of wine before glasses were poured, a huge no-no. Be forewarned that they add a few percent to the prices for using a credit card, which is not noted on the menu, it just appears on the bill. Read more Very nice addition to the neighborhood.

The food is uneven  and pricey.  We love this restaurant - food is always delicious. Service is wonderful and great ambience. And the drinks are delicious too!  Good local place for dinner.  Ordered 6 dishes for 2 people and 5 would have been enough.  Loved the bacon wrapped dates and Brussels sprouts.  Friendly service, though a bit loud early in the evening.  Excellent food - pleasant atmosphere.  Very helpful with wine selection from well- priced wine list  I love this place and frequently choose it as a place to meet friends. There are several mainstays on the tapas menu that are terrific- the baby artichokes, the shrimp, the Brussels Sprouts. We had two special tapas this time, a delicious ribeye with arugula, and a seared mahi-mahi filet with a green sauce. The co-owner and sometime hostess, Courtney, is always charming, funny and an expert at making you feel welcome. Read more The food was quite delicious, I especially enjoyed the shrimp and the lamb chops.  The service was good.  Unfortunately, the enclosed area in front of the entrance where we were sitting wasn't waterproof and we had to move indoors because it began to rain.

The owner, Courtney, is a force of nature- welcoming, informative (not just about food), and happy to suggest some of the most special dishes.  The staff is excellent as is the food and drink (best sangria I’ve ever had (had the ‘special’ one)).

The croquettes are especially recommended.  Service was good.  The only downside is that the inside tables are all tall, and we like regular tables.  So in February we sat outside, and it was comfortable until the heater above our table stopped working.  Will return in the spring or fall when outdoor dining is more comfortable.

Service was professional and attentive without being disruptive  Wonderful ambiance and warm staff.  Lovely mediterranean food!  I did not find the staff attentive 

lunch food portion was small  Casa Limone up until today was a NYC favorite. Today was such a big disappointment. Why?
1.  A host who acted disinterested and did not welcome / greet us warmly when we arrived.
This same host saw us leave and there was no acknowledgment whatsoever.
2.  I ordered pasta with clams.  At 6 pm they were out of clams.
3. I ordered tagliatelle in veal ragu instead.  It was  tasteless, watery and almost meatless.  I had to ask for salt and pepper to improve the taste.
4. The chicken in lemon was 1/4 of a whole chicken with 4 pieces of baby potatoes. We had ordered this dish before.  The quantity of the serving was markedly smaller.

All around a definite winner !  I like this restaurant— good food, good service, great location.  The food was excellent and the service was great!!  The atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable. I highly recommend this restaurant!!  We ordered a 30 day aged New York strip steak for $60. It was very tough,, clearly was not 30 day aged. Could not eat it. The skirt steak was very good. Prices as one would expect for New York City. Read more Excellent food and service.  The wait staff was amazing. The food dishes could feed more than one person.  Great location, good food, well be back pre theater!  I have been before back in 2019 .
Great restaurant , good service and perfectly situated for Broadway !!

When we arrived we felt a bit on show on our table and the guests next to is were loud. We asked to be moved and it was done quickly and to lovely area .

Our server was fabulous !  We ordered Bruschetta and buratta/proscuitto to start followed  by Lasagna and gluten free carbonara- delicious and very generous portions.

We followed with an espresso , espresso martini and split a portion of the  canoli’s

A wonderful Saturday night meal before our show. Thoroughly recommend Read more I ordered the carbonara with gluten-free pasta. It arrived without any guanciale. I had to ask for the guanciale to be added. The server took the dish away and returned it with four small burned bits of guanciale. The dish did not have a hard cheese and tasted like Mac & cheese with some burnt bacon. The server was inattentive and his clothe smelled like pot. This was very disappointing, as we have previously dined at this restaurant several times over the past four years Read more Food was awesome, but the staff really made it a great night, the bartender and our server were awesome, great recommendations and attentive!  Read more Honestly, we were expecting a lot more for the price and were very disappointed. The chicken parm, was so thin that’s was incredibly dry and burnt around the edges. The sauce tasted like a cheap canned sauce. The pasta was watery and had no flavor. The garlic loaf tasted great, but was really small…especially compared the the next table over who ordered the same thing.

The service was pretty non-existent. We only saw our server to take out order and to get out check. The water refilled was great, but the server couldn’t care less. There were for of us who shared meals, only had water and one of their specialty cocktails. With a tip it was worth about $50, but it was $165. We will not return and will tell others to avoid. Read more Make sure new address on 46th Street is on all social media and navigation programs.  Excellent food, great selection on the menu. Definitely would go back!  Great service, nice and varied food, a little pricey but worth it for before theater dining.  First time here for this avid theatre goer! Will need to become a regular! Food was delicious, service was outstanding!  Food was outstanding! One of the best Chicken Parm’s I’ve had in a while!  The service was fair at best. They were clearing away our plates away as we were finishing out last bites of food. Which is so enjoying. We ordered a specialty bread since they do not have table bread and it came 20 minutes after our meal. Overall not impressed Read more Always good.  An Old New York standard.  Yhe pizza is a must have.  Great food  We have eaten here several times in the past and enjoyed the food. The food tonight was subpar.

I ordered:

MAINE LOBSTER STROZZAPRETI FRA DIAVOLO
lobster with black truffle
$44

The plate came with a half of a lobster on a large bed of the strozzapreti, which was a bit undercooked. No lobster fork nor cracker was provided. The lobster tail meatwas really small about 2 inches and chewy.

The waiter came and I asked if someone could crack the claw, best part right?

He took the plate and it was returned,reheated with a crack inthe claw and a cracker sitting in the sauce.  Still no lobster fork, I tried to crack the claw, but was not successful, fork was too big and feared getting the abundant sauce on my clothes.
Didn’t expect to have to work for my dinner. Wouldn’t have minded if provided a bib, finger bowl and proper utensils
$44 - seriously?

Greatly disappointed and won’t be back Read more Read more Food was good, service was slow.  Took a bit for entree to come.  Pasta was ok.  It was a nice experience.  We loved the food. The tuna with lentilles was exquisite and the ravioli were very good.  I enjoyed their Moscow Mule.  Special birthday celebration for my granddaughter’s first trip to NYC!  The service was amazing.  So kind to my granddaughter!  Loved our dinner!  A great spot for a delicious meal before or after a show. Service was discreet & accommodating for my daughter & 3 friends & me to celebrate her Sweet 16.  Great Service! Pizza was amazing. Recommend the pepperoni. We also really enjoyed the desserts.
They were very accommodating for the picky eaters in my group.  We had a favorite midtown Italian style restaurant - now we have a new favorite, Bond 45!

I was with my sisters and brother going to a show across the street. I always loved Bond 45 when it was at its old location so I was excited to go last night. The place is nice but smaller than old place. The only complaint I really have is the drinks were ridiculously expensive and not a full glass of anything. $20 glass and a quarter full is not right  my sisters margarita was in a rock glass with a huge square ice cube in it. When she picked up the ice cube it was a quarter full  my cadmium was a small proper glass but not full  coffee was cold. Diet Coke was not good  so drinks bad but food delicious. Waiter was professional and nice even with our drink complaints he did best to accommodate Read more Service was wonderful. Food ok. Food served too hot. Great location.  Bond 45 is a gem in the theatre district. We discovered it grabbing a drink before “The Wiz” a few months ago and had dinner with friends after a matinee last night.

Linda our server goes above & beyond.  Loved dining here after watching a show. Fun and lovely atmosphere but also nice for couples/family  Can’t hear your partner. Waited a half out between appetizer and leaving, lost our appetite!  Super fun place for tourists, way too much food for 2 people.  Great meal, priced fairly. Definitely not a midtown tourist trap.

Food was fantastic   One of the best Italian meals I have ever had. I think you need a strategy to order since there is a lot of food.  We visit every trip to NYC- food this time wasn’t up to its usual standard.  It was as delicious as it always is every single time we go to one of their restaurants, and we have been to both locations and love them both!  Tony's is the best! Ate here many times with family and every time was awesome! There's no other place we'd rather go to then here. So worth it!  As always great service, Music, Food and ambience.

Our waiter was pleasant and professional and came to the table many times to check on us during the meal.  Plates were cleared and water was consistently refilled.  The food we ordered was good but not outstanding.  We had the lentil soup special and onion soup, both tasty enough.  My tuna salad nicoise was nicely prepared and presented, but only the greens were dressed, so it ate a bit dry and bland. Short ribs also needed some additional seasoning. My son's burger was rarer than he ordered but fine and the fries were very good. The bread and butter were delicious however.

We had a fantastic time with friends at this rooftop and nightclub, even though the weather was challenging with gusty winds and rain. The manager went above and beyond to accommodate us, providing seats under a roof with heat lamps and even offering towels since it was quite chilly. The cocktails were decent—what you’d expect for an open rooftop/club—and the food was enjoyable. The chicken tacos and the burger with crispy fries were particularly delicious!

After dinner, the manager was very understanding and allowed us to enter the nightclub without having to go back downstairs, which we really appreciated.

I was threatened and physically assaulted in the hotel lobby by Somewhere Nowhere’s security guard (a tall fat bald black man) when I asked for a to go container for my food.  Service was slow.

1.  You can actually SPEAK to a human when you call!  In so many restaurants you can’t get anyone on the phone, if perchance you may need to change a reservation or whatever.  The host, Kaela was wonderful!
2.  Servers- Outstanding.  Both servers happen to have the same names and they were on point, pleasant, cheery, accommodating and they and the manager get 6*!  Thank you!
3.  Food & Drinks- Drinks were creative and delicious and the food was also varied-even for vegans.  Still love the hot cornbread-eyes roll back delectable.

Now areas of much needed improvement?
Yikes!  The table was so old and cruddy, I had to create my own table cloth to cover it by using 4 napkins!  Unacceptable!  Eating on a table that looks dirty is bananas!  Get rid of, or just table cloth all the tables until you can afford new ones!

The bathroom? Yikes x2!  Disgustingly old and cruddy!  I’m glad I didn’t go in there BEFORE I ate.

The vibe was great and the service from Tierra T was special, i recommend you ask for her because she will help you find what you need/ want, also we are not from New York so she gave us places we need to see. if your looking for great food, Great music and good people please stop by Red Rooster, the only Harlem place to eat! we will be back and see you soon! Read more Overall, good dining experience and food were very good. Our server, Jada was very hospitable and attentive.  The good was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  Our Server, Jade made our experience even better.  She is incredible and if she is working when you visit ask for her!  The fried breast of chicken was crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  The salad and French fries were also tasty. Portion sizes were generous.
The service staff were excellent.  They made sure that my party of six were satisfied with every aspect of our Red Rooster experience.
I would definitely go back to the Red Rooster and would recommend this restaurant highly. Read more Love having Sunday brunch at Red Rooster! Between the great food and service and the live music, makes for a fun day…thank you.  ￼ incredible food and service.  Would go again in a heart beat.  Stay away from the lobster roll.  It was loaded with lobster, but the bun was small. The dish was nothing special and the roll looked funny next to the mound of french fries. The Bucatini was delicious. I would go back just for this. The pasta could've been pulled 30 seconds earlier but it was still pretty good. It was a nice ambience except they have an open kitchen concept and the cooks were joking loudly which took away from the experience. Great restaurant, but a tad disappointing from such a renowned chef who hasn't completely distilled his product to capitalize on his fame. Read more My experience was pretty good.  It was Live Jazz night, and the music was a bit too loud.  We were straining our voices to talk to each other.  Regarding my meal, the food was excellent.  However, I changed my mind from a thigh and leg to a thigh and breast.  When I was served my plate it looked like there were 2 thighs on my plate.  The person who brought the food out (not my server) assured me that one piece was a breast.  Well, it wasn't and since it sat on my plate for 20 minutes and I cut it open, I felt obligated to eat it when I really wanted a breast.  All in all, the service was great, and the food was delicious. I will return. Read more This trip to Red Rooster was for our son’s 25th birthday but it was not our first meal here. You don’t need to have a special occasion to dine at Marcus Samuelsson’s fabulous Harlem soul-food restaurant. As. Southerner, I love the food - collards are actually cooked right! Mashed potatoes are creamy. Grits are sublime. And don’t even get me started on their fried chicken! Influences of Samuelsson’s African roots are present in dishes like fried catfish over an African inspired bed of lentils (stewed). What is not good on the menu? Great question - I don’t know because everything we had was great. And the music was incredible - live music every night. One thing that was just so-so were the mixed drinks so I’d stick with the standards and do’t go for one of the “special” cocktails.

The ceviche is a must! So flavorful and delicious. We had a little hiccup with the drinks but it was rectified right away and with a smile.

My friends also had the fries with sausage and cheese( I don’t eat pork so I didn’t have it) but they said that it was also amazing. ￼

It has a party kind of vibe with current spanish jams.  Coming into our reservation, we were late so we called the restaurant to push our reservation time back and they were able to accommodate us. Getting there, we sat down in a high table very uncomfortable. I asked if they can move us to a lower seating area and they couldn’t so I understood. Chicken was nothing special. Nachos were the best thing they had there. Our server was not very attentive to us. We had to look for her multiple times. We then got the check and they double charged my friend’s card because their “internet went down” which has nothing to do with us. The charges were also 2 different amounts which really made no sense. We told the manager and the manager advised that she was new but she had someone shadowing her which also did not make any sense.

This was for a wedding meal and they did absolutely everything to make it so special for the happy couple.  I chose RH Rooftop Restaurant for our dinner one night. When we got there staff was helpful in getting us upstairs and seated and everyone was very nice. The ambiance from the moment you step into the building until you are up on the rooftop was impeccable. I ordered the dip and my boyfriend ordered the lobster roll. I enjoyed my food but my boyfriend was not much impressed with his as it did lack a bit of flavor he was expecting. The biggest and only real problem we experienced at RH Rooftop Restaurant is that the service was awful. We saw our server once when he asked us what to drink, once when we took our food order and once when our food had come out before we had even taken a bite when he asked us how everything was. We also never got silverware or napkins the entire time we were sat. Although this was not his fault per say, if he were to have actually been present in our dining experience, I wouldn’t have had grease dripping down my hands for 30 minutes until he finally came back after we had finished our food. The service was one of the worst I’ve ever experienced, luckily the ambiance made up for what he sure lacked.

We never received our fries but they were on our bill, and then there was these odd chargebacks on our bill that weren’t actually taken off.

Love the remodel, a well understated treat.  Outstanding experience. Great atmosphere and food.  Outstanding service and food.  We had a wonderful time.  Well worth every penny  This is my second time at Oceana Restaurant, though the first trip was quite a long time ago. Reserved table for 2 for pre broadway show dinner. 

Overall experience was enjoyable but I expect it better from the this type of establishment. Here is my feedback:

1) Ambiance - open large restaurant with private rooms. Gets noisy. The tables for two are tiny. If you want to share dishes, not enough space. 

2) Reservations and Seating - easy via opentable. Though they needed a few min to be ready, was easy to enjoy the bar and they seat you promptly. 

3) Food - I really wish that they kept some of the menu choices from past, my personal favourite was coriander and rhubarb root sorbet options. Still passion fruit and mixed fruit were not bad. Best dishes we had were Gnocchi (amazing) and Corn Raviolli. Asparagus Risotto and Soft Shell crab were done well too.  Squash blossoms appetizer is deep fried, not really tasty, simply would not recommend at all. Overall we enjoyed the food. 

4) Service - this is our biggest disappointment and reflected on the rating. First I want to say that staff is polite, we were there early for 5pm dinner so dishes came out quickly and at the right temperature. The issue I had is with expectation of service at the table. The staff came over few times to ask if we want anything however it's what they didn't do: brought the bottle of water but besides first time pouring it never followed up on doing so again; never asked how the food was; left empty dishes on our table for a long period of time and didn't move them. We had large table so luckily I was moving the empty dishes to the side. They didn't start the cleanup till we asked to see the desert menu. For us, service should not be overly intrusive but basic things like pouring water, taking plates are a must. Just felt they could have done a bit better.

One of my favorite restaurants in NYC.
Love it! Read more The hostess put us upstairs and was very accommodative when asked to be put on another table away from the crowd given the sensitivity of the conversation.   Eric took great care of us and got us out in the time we told him we needed to leave....   Great food,  ambience and service! Read more Everything from the drinks to the grid and service was top notch!! Highly recommend  I’ve had many great experiences at Del Frisco’s. In fact, I dine there every time I come to New York. I look forward to the experience. There’s no other place like it in the city. But this last time was rough. The host staff was very unpleasant, it took an hour to get my table, even with a reservation. The kitchen lost my order and it took 3 hours in total to get and finish my meal. My waiter was good and tried to make the best a lame experience, but the delay getting a table, the terrible attitude of the host staff and the missing order, combined with a price tag of $110 for one chicken entree with soup and a side dish, equals a well-deserved one-star rating. Read more We were seated outside party of 5 because there were no available seating inside and when it was 60 something degrees out. We waited to order for 20-30 minutes and no server came to provide water and bread. So I went inside to ask the host what’s going on? 10 minutes later a server came out and said “sorry no one had told me I had a table outside”. Unbelievable! Lack of communication. Secondly when we were maybe 80-90% done they had rushed in with 2 new servers asking if we are done ready to take everything away so they can get ready for another party. No desert? Ok here’s the check and take all the remaining food away when at least 1 person was still finishing up. We felt uncomfortably rushed, so we just paid our $600 bill and left. I get you’re busy, but you still need to keep good service please. Read more Havent been here for a long time and am anxious to come back asap.   Wonderful restaurant…great food and service…  A truly classic steakhouse located in wonderful setting. The tables are far apart and the ceiling high high high.

Excellent food, fine wine, superb service, lovely ambience   Always our favorite!  Good was better than ever and loved our table!  Our waiter Christoper was amazing!!!! The ambience was amazing!

Saved to my fav list and most likely will visit again in the near future. Thanks!  We had a great experience.  The food was delicious and our server Shirley was awesome!  Been here before and glad we came back! The food and service here is 2nd to none.   Can’t get any better.  It was girls night for my step daughter and sister-n-law.

Read more Consistently delicious and affordable happy hour specials are much appreciated at this lovely spot. Back outdoor seating area is adorable.  The food was very bad. It didn’t have any seasoning and not fresh at all. We ended up leaving after our appetizer.  It was a great experience. The food was delicious, and the service was perfect. I'd go back there again.  You guys were great, the food was delicious, the service was very helpful in answering all our questions and being friendly  The food and service were excellent! We can’t wait to go back.  Awesome meal and service. Will definitely be back.  We enjoyed this restaurant!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Great service!  We wanted oysters and they were delicious!  We also had steak frites,  crab dip, mussels,  and the skirt steak philly.  They were all very good.  We highly recommend and will return. Read more The waitress was so nice and friendly. The mofongo wasn’t as savory as I expected, but I’m used to Dominican mofongo. The Crabby Patty and grilled oysters were great!  The service, food and staff were excellent. Jesse, the bartender, along with the waitress (didnt catch her name) were great to our group of 5.  Read more Nice surprise to find. A very quaint restaurant with awesome seafood choices.  Staff extremely friendly and helps make good suggestions.   Definitely going back.  We went for brunch for my son’s birthday.  Chose this for the oysters but loved it for everything else. 

Can’t wait to go back. Read more First time back to Off the Hook in about a year, and it is not the same place I remember frequenting. Service was so slow ... we just ordered oysters, grilled calamari salad and fish and chips and it took more than an hour. Perhaps it was an off night. 
However while the oysters were very fresh, they were not shucked so we had to pull them from the shell. This was not the case a year ago when I was a regular. The salad was fresh yet the calamari rings were inedible. I showed the server how I could not even break one in two by stretching it and she tried to convince me that ""calamari is always tough"" I am a big foodie and cook, and I know better. I requested she ask the chef to eat one and if he could I will pay for my dish. Needless to say it was taken off the bill.
Not sure if I will risk another Saturday night on this place although we may just come back for the fish and chips. Read more Food was good and so was the service.  Sat in outdoor space and it was great.  A great find in astoria  Seafood was delish! Ordered oysters and steamed clams to start and they were awesome!  Entrees were delicious! Waitress was very attentive and friendly!  It was good  The food at Off The Hook was good. My wife ordered the salmon which was delicious and I had the fish tacos which were also pretty good. The prices were reasonable although I thought we'd get more shrimp in the shrimp cocktail. We also ordered a dozen oysters which were delicious but thought it was odd that they did not give you a horseradish unless you asked for it. Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoy Seafood Read more Loved the food. Had a great experience. Worth the drive to Astoria.  This is one of our favorite restaurants!

The food and service are always fantastic. The tuna tart, mushroom salad, scallops, sea bass and wagyu steak are just incredible. Truly. And the service is a standout, especially for such a popular restaurant with a great vibe. Read more Overall, not the best experience compared to other times I’ve been. Our table was ready but then we were told to wait at the bar (which had no room to stand at), and then as we finally got drinks we were moved to our table. The table beside us was constantly brought food “on the house” (multiple dishes were served complimentary) while we waited for our food to come out. Our server switched mid way with no warning, and we had to chase down help for basic things like soy sauce for our meal. I normally love this location but it wasn’t great for a work dinner to bring a client along to (it wasn’t great all around). Read more We enjoyed the food and the service. Love Bondst it is a favorite of mine and my family.  I told the restaurant and through OpenTable that it was my nephew’s birthday (he’s 13). The lady next to us got a dessert and it was her birthday - they presented it to her with a nice happy birthday presentation. Even though I told the restaurant twice, right when we arrived as well, they had forgotten and ultimately brought (the same dessert) with just a candle. Wouldn’t have been so bad if he hadn’t seen what the restaurant did for the old lady sitting next to us. Read more A great experience! Service was perfect. Food was great! Our servers where on point with everything. Highly recommended. We booked our reservation that afternoon and got good time options. Read more Exceptional food. Some items were unexpected / unique and beyond excellent. Service is attentive yet quiet. Views o er the Hudson are terrific if you prefer to not face inside the restaurant. Not inexpensive to say the least but certainly worth the experience. Read more The food was absolutely outstanding and our waitress was very understanding of our time crunch! Cant wait to come back!!  Food and drinks were excellent however at a restaurant of this caliber I expected the servers to be more attentive. We ordered a lot of food and the appetizers came quickly but it took over an hour for our sushi to come. Once we mentioned something they were kind enough to give us an app to hold us over.

The last visit this week they messed up our table and afterwards, they sent out comp appetizers.  I didn’t pay attention signing the bill because I’ve never had an issue, after looking the next day it shows I’m charged more than the 20% gratuity and was charged for things we didn’t order.  I contacted the restaurant and have heard nothing.  After spending $1700 for 6 at dinner where only 2 people were drinking, I’d expect a little more.  Never going back.

Lovely experience  There is good food and bad food. While the sea bass was perfect, the salmon roll tasted liked it was done the day before  This must have been a new wait staff in training
Never seat a couple on a birthday romantically inclined (special notes made in my reservation)in between (2!) loud families…
The place exuded a “las Vegas” flip flop beach wear crowd very lackadaisical and the staff mimicked their diners dress in their attitudes Read more Every time we go to BondST, we have incredible food and an even more incredible experience. You are greeted at the door by the friendliest hosts and taken to a table with warm, moody lighting and a buzzing ambiance and views of the Vessel.

Every member of the waitstaff (especially Michelle, Brennan and the Manager Justin) make the whole experience so enjoyable. BondST takes hospitality seriously — making sure all guests feel welcomed and attended to.

There are some definite standout dishes on the menu: the tuna tart with truffle ponzu, seared salmon nigiri, crispy rice with spicy tuna, salmon avocado roll, toro nigiri, beef gyoza dumplings and the lychee martinis.

Beverages include a tiny selection of beer and wine. They have soda too, but out of Diet Coke, out of the Super Tuscan wine  & several of the pizzas we wanted from the online menus were not available in the restaurant.

The mussels mightve been the worst I've had in my entire life. My dad was brought the wrong food and he had to chase down a bus boy to get it changed. My mussels were flavorless with raw onion and carrot. Not once we're we checked on. Had to chase down the waiter for the check. Hands down no contest the worst restaurant I've been to in nyc and I've lived here for 10 years. Read more Every visit reflects consistency in quality of food and service.  What a delightful experience on the beautiful back patio of B. Cafe for brunch! Food was wonderful; portions were generous; service was on point. 😋🤩  Been to B Cafe before and really enjoyed it.  So when I made a reservation for this last visit I was expecting a good time.  Through no fault of the restaurant, it was completely empty.  This made for a less than expected good time.  It was kind of creepy.  And I don't think the kitchen was ready with things due to the low volume of clients.  French Fries had to be asked for even though they came with the entree (had to wait I suppose for them to make them) and coffee was not readily available.  
Food was so so - nothing special.  I have had the avocado toast before but this time it was as if it was put together quickly and not much avocado.  My friend had a salad with added chicken.  The salad was mostly lettuce and one paltry tomato that had a big blemish in it.  Sad. Read more B Cafe is our favorite brunch stop on the UES.  It never disappoints. Authentic Belgian fare delivered perfectly is the key. The biggest problem is choosing what to eat!  Reservation is a must. While you can’t eat the ambiance it certainly adds to the experience.  Also one of the best Happy Hours around.
Enjoy! Read more Staff is welcoming and accommodating. Great brunch menu. A lovely variety of choices. Food is fantastic. Brunch gets busy but tables aren’t too crowded.  The B Cafe on the UES is a wonderful neighborhood dining spot.  The food is very good and the serving staff are very pleasant and professional.  The endive salad was absolutely delicious, the best example of this popular appetizer that I've ever tasted.  The menu is full of nice, comforting choices.  This is very much the kind of small restaurant one finds in Paris neighborhoods.  (Yes, I know it is Belgian.).   The B Cafe has been here for a long time for a reason. Read more Great food, great service! A hidden gem. We will definitely be back!  Excellent quality food and value... and a very good neighborhood fixture. Just wish the happy hour specials were available at the tables, as I recall that was the case in the past  Read more Excellent mussels with fries! Good selection of beers and good service.  I've dined here countless times and have never been disappointed.  The staff is friendly, attentive, and professional.  The food has always been great!  The atmosphere is lively but not crowded or noisy.  Always a positive experience. Read more The food is average (except for some delicious desserts), but the noise level makes it extremely difficult to have a conversation, and is not relaxing  Always a treat. The ""moules frites"" ( mussels and French fries) are heavenly. The service is friendly and impeccable. I live in the neighborhood and I dine at B. Cafe very often. In addition to loving the food, I enjoy feeling as though I am in Belgium. If you don't live on the Upper Eastside of Manhattan, it's worth a trip here for this restaurant. Read more I went for brunch and arrived very early. The hostess gave me a place to sit and offered a glass of cold water -- how kind! Everyone was friendly and service was excellent. I went with a very very picky friend and she loved the food also. They were also very accommodating of any requests. They also have a lovely outdoor garden out back. Looking forward to my next visit! Read more Brunch with friends visiting from Australia.   We all were very happy with the brunch menu, the actual food, the service and the decor, both inside and in the garden.  We sat at our table for over 3 hours.  No pressure and continued service.  Will definitely return for brunch and will try out dinner one day. Read more Got seated quickly, the food was good and the resturant was beautiful. The service was not bad but I would’ve appreciated more of an effort for our waitress. I requested to have something changed in my order, I asked the if she could ask kitchen if they could do it (Get my burger lettuce wrapped).  She never got back to me and just sent out the food  without a bun or without it being lettuce wrapped, so I didn’t get either or and I didn’t get to decide. It would’ve been nice to know that she did in fact check with the kitchen and have the option to decide how I would’ve wanted to proceed with the order. It’s always appreciated when you know someone puts in the effort. Read more I’ve come here a lot and it’s usually a really nice neighborhood restaurant. This Friday night there were a total of two tables - service was slow and horrific, and the mussels were shriveled and small instead of the usual plump and tasty. I hope this is not its twilight. Also there were tons of mosquitoes in the back and we all got bitten up. All in all, we regretted our choice. Read more Excellent as usual. The mussels were perfect. The steak was plenty and cooked just so. The French fries were the best. Blaise, our server, went above and beyond to accommodate us. Will definitely go back. Read more What a lucky find on the Upper East Side. Unfortunately, it was just too hot to eat in the lovely garden out back, but still had a wonderful Sunday brunch. Both of us agreed our food was delicious (classic eggs Benedict, and vegetable quiche). Service was good. Coffee and tea a bit overpriced at $5.00 each, but food prices were reasonable. Already looking forward to my next visit. Read more Read more Very frustrating experience.  Placed our order, waited 25 minutes and was not served yet.  Asked staff how much longer and was told 5 minutes.  Waited but no food was brought to our table after 5 minutes.   After waiting over 30 minutes we left and never learned the problem. Read more B cafe is an intimate pleasant dining experience. This is my 4th visit and the service and food are consistently excellent! The staff is very pleasant and accommodating. I highly recommend this restaurant l. Having been to Belgium a number of times, I find their cuisine quite authentic!

You won’t be disappointed!! Read more Everyone, especially the bartender was excellent! My friends and I had a great time!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!  Friendly service and good value meals.  Consistent.  The food was excellent.  BUT our problems were with service.  First ingredients were included that I specifically asked to be excluded from an omelette.  Second, I had to make four separate requests for mustard (instead they kept bringing ketchup). Third, there was a request to put the sweet items included with a waffle on the side, of course they came on the waffle. Lastly, getting a refill of coffee, and separately milk (because they never brought them together, meaning the coffee kept getting cold while waiting) was a running joke at our table.   On the other hand, the garden area is lovely and the fans kept temperatures reasonable during the heat wave.  Also, the food was excellent (problems notwithstanding).  Maybe brunch is not the best time to go. Read more Very good spot for Belgium food. Awesome beer menu and nice outdoor space in the back  This is a great place in our neighborhood.  Food is always good, the staff is friendly without being overbearing.  Always a pleasure! Reserve in the lovely garden room.  Dinner for four on saturday night,  service was very good and food was very good. Mussels were excellent, and beer selection was extensive (primarily Belgian beers).  We enjoyed the garden room in the back. And we noticed the snacks and drinks discounts at the bar (all night on Sat. and Sun.; for a couple of hours on weeknights).'

Nestled inside Super Nice Coffee, Sushi by Bou in Chelsea is a hidden treasure that offers one of the best omakase experiences in New York City. The moment you step inside, you're greeted with an intimate atmosphere that’s perfect for a date night or a special evening out. The space features a handful of seats at the counter where diners can watch the skilled chefs meticulously prepare each piece of sushi. There are also a few tables, providing a more private but equally exceptional experience.

The food? Simply put, incredible. We opted for the 17-course Bougie Omakase, and each bite somehow surpassed the one before. Every piece was masterfully crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients that melted in your mouth, from buttery tuna to perfectly balanced uni. It's hard to choose a standout because each course was flawless, but the richness and precision of flavors were undeniable.

The service elevated the experience to another level. Imax, who greeted us at the door, ensured we felt welcomed from the moment we arrived. He checked in throughout the night, making sure everything was perfect without being intrusive. It was clear that the staff took pride in creating an unforgettable dining experience.

Sushi by Bou at Super Nice Coffee isn’t just a place to eat; it’s a destination for sushi enthusiasts and anyone looking for an extraordinary culinary journey.

I had the absolute pleasure of dining at this incredible omakase sushi restaurant with my boyfriend, and it was hands down the best sushi I have ever had. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly by the staff, who were not only attentive but genuinely personable and welcoming. The atmosphere was intimate, yet lively, making it the perfect setting for a special evening.

The chef, who is clearly a master of his craft, curated an unforgettable culinary journey. Each piece of sushi was a work of art – fresh, expertly crafted, and absolutely bursting with flavor. From the melt-in-your-mouth toro to the perfectly seasoned rice, every bite left us in awe.

The service was impeccable throughout the night, and it’s rare to find a place where both the food and the staff exceed your expectations. We laughed, enjoyed great conversation with the staff, and left feeling like we’d experienced something one-of-a-kind. My boyfriend and I couldn’t stop talking about how amazing the entire night was.

What an intriguing location! Love the sushi at a great price.  I had an awesome time at Sushi by Bou - Chelsea! I first heard about Sushi by Bou on Instagram and decided to make a last minute late late night reservation because I was going to be in the area. From the time I walked in to the time I walked out, service was a 10/10. I may have been the last omakase reservation of the evening and it was well worth it! I have a gluten and dairy allergy which I always make note on my reservations and as soon as I sat down, the manager repeated my allergy back to me and the chef and I knew I would be in good hands. They have gluten free soy sauce (always a win) and when preparing each course, chef explained what each one was and even swapped out the ones I could not have because they were made with regular soy sauce and made me something different. I loved every single bite (except the course with the sea urchin but that is more a texture thing than anything) and the cocktail I ordered was delicious. All in all make your reservation.

The pasta was cold and the chicken Parmesan really didn’t have any flavor. Plenty of other places to pick from.  Food was delicious and the ambiance was relaxing and modern.

After traveling all day we didn’t feel like venturing back out for dinner and saw many time’s available for being seated.

Delicate fresh food and many vegetable dishes  Delicious late night dinner after a show!  Great service!  Would certainly try this place a second time.  Food was good.  Service was inattentive.  Drinks arrived when 1st course was served after a long wait.  We went for restaurant week.  The food was very good.  One problem was that I told them I needed to be out by 6 for a 6:30 show.  They misunderstood and thought we had to be out by 6:45.  I'm not sure how that happened since I said it more than 1 time.  They also forgot about one of our appetizer orders.  We didn't get our main course until, about 5:50 and needed to eat very quickly.  We asked for the bill, which was incorrect, in our favor, and corrected it.  They then fixed the bill, which took more time.  
They did let us come back, after the show, for our desserts, which was part of the restaurant week menu, which was very nice.  I did think they should have thrown something in for free since we let them know they didn't charge us for 4 cocktails.  

I do wish we could have gone on a day that we were not rushed.  As I said, the food I had was very good.  My daughter and her boyfriend were not happy with their appetizer and dessert choices, but mine were great. Read more Read more We had a wonderful server who did not rush us and was so patient!

Will return to try more of the menu!  Service was poor, took a while to be seated with a reservation, took a while for the server to first visit the table. Drinks took a while, food took a while  Too often we love a place the first time only to discover on a follow up visit that it was just a mirage. This was NOT the case with AperiBar.

More pizza options welcomed.  A very nice place and very nice people. I only had a margarita pizza and it was very good and consistent with pizzas I’ve had in Napoli. The only complaint being that the tomato sauce itself is tasteless. There is no Italian flavor to it and it was completely missing the wonderful flavors of basil, oregano, garlic, and even salt.

In 1997 Chef Masatoshi “Gari” Sugio opened the first Sushi of Gari and introduced New Yorkers to a new way to enjoy sushi. With the Gari style, no longer was soy sauce the only accompaniment, and in order to get guests to fully enjoy the fish chef added elements of surprise that came in the way of a sauce or other type of topping.

Please note: Sushi Bar reservation is not available online. Please contact the restaurant directly.","Read more The service was very rushed. Our party was disappointed with the experience.  Service was good, and food was ok.  Maitake Mushroom tempura was very flavorful.  For the money, I've had better sushi in many restaurants.  Really good food with a nice neighborhood feel.  Would go back if looking for really good sushi without any pretentiousness.  This was my fourth or fifth time visiting Gari, and first time being so disappointed but their service.
(Gari used to be my hands down favorite restaurant when I lived in the city - you’d be able to notice this very easily with my previous ratings and comments.)
First of all, I visited around 4:30pm when the restaurant was not crowded at all. In fact, there was just one other group(party of 2) sitting when I got there. After we got seated, another party of four entered the restaurant, and the staff seated them adjacent to us. A little confused why they had to sit us so close by when the whole restaurant was almost empty. I would not have minded this except the four were extremely loud. The restaurant was almost silent before they came, but with their entrance, now they were laughing out loud, chit chatting with the staff (asking about different alcohols and telling them what they drink when they visit Japan- this kind of conversation is completely fine in many restaurant, but Gari is supposed to be more modest. It is not a casual American restaurant.), and lectured among themselves about statistics and econometrics.
My mom and I wanted to escape and walk outside as soon as possible so we hurried to finish our meal. But unfortunately, our waiter disappeared and we had to sit there for about 15 mins after finishing the meal, listening to the unwanted conversation from the table adjacent to us.
S
We couldn’t locate our waiter at the end, and had to ask someone else to bring the check for us, which then took quite a long time to be taken care of.
And on top of this, NOBODY visited my table to check if everything is okay once our dishes came out.
I am quite shocked Gari, or any Japanese restaurant would provide this kind of poor service. Only three tables occupied, and there were almost 10 staffs, and this is how I was treated. My mother who rarely complains about things was extremely upset. Honestly, I was quite shamed to bring my mother there. Read more I’ve always loved Sushi of Gari, but last night my family was very underwhelmed by the food. Something was off . It’s usually an incredible meal, but last night was just average and even a little sub average. And the cost requires that you leave feeling justified for spending that kind of money.  So bummed. I hope it was just an off night… Read more They rushed us out which for an expensive meal I don’t appreciate.  Sushi was great but does not justify the price. 4 omakase and a bottle of sake was around $1,000.  The food is definitely good but way overpriced. These prices are in line with what a 2 Michelin star restaurant would be. If you get sushi + drinks you're spending at at least $300+ for 2 people. Which isn't horrible but the quality doesn't quite live up to that price. Read more All was absolutely wonderful in terms of service and most of the sushi. This i was our 5th or 6th visit over the last year. However the Toro sashimi on this visit was cold almost hard and had a fishy not buttery aftertaste.

Normally the Toro is delicious at Gari.. So we take off 1 star for the disappointing Toro this time. Read more Rude hostess. Decent food and service. Not worth going there. Better to order in.  Read more Not what it used to be. We've been coming to Sushi of Gary for years and it's always been excellent. the past couple of visits have been poor. the quality of the food seems to have dropped. Tuna Avocado role that was tasteless, overcooked shrimp tempura roll that left it chewy, cod with miso that was also overcooked. I think this is our last visit. Read more Hands down the best sushi restaurant in NYC. Love these guys  Their time has come and gone. Sushi may be good but everything else is below average quality . Felt like the food came from the freezer and was heated in a micro wave. Also, they rushed you through everything as table turnover seemed to be paramount ! The restaurant on 46th street may be better but Columbus ave is a good miss . Read more Food was amazing and our waiter was very friendly. The only complaint I have is that I made a Reservation for 3, my wife,  myself and our baby knowing we would either need space at the table for our stroller or a high chair. They provided neither. Then after questioning their policy they called someone who told them to park us at an ADA table at the front but that we were time restricted due to another reservation.  What made the situation even more frustrating is they tried making us feel like they were doing us a favor - we did not. Read more Great food nice Japanese atmosphere excellent service  We asked the chef to prepare whatever he wanted based on what was freshest. It was a great experience with each roll having its own distinctive presentation and flavor. The fish was the freshest imaginable. There was no need for soy sauce. Service was excellent! Love! Read more Good as always and having hot food helps with the children. Male host needs to be a bit more gracious and hospitable.  This has been our sushi place for over 20 years.
Always consistent quality sushi.  Had been trying to get into Gari on 46th St for awhile. It's always booked. Found Columbus location and decided to give it a go. The place is small, but as an early diner, it was fine. Tight tables but food & service made that inconsequential. Smallish menu, but strong in what they offer. Hijiki was excellent as was the avocado & tuna app. Parmesan was a strang pairing with the fried maiitake mushroom s; ponzu would have been better. Sushi was excellent. Will have the uni next time. Did not do ""toppings"" on sushi, but it did look interesting at the next table. Price wise,  not anymore than other joints and definitely worth it for the quality they serve. Service was great, from host to busboys. Great place. Read more One of our fav sushi places in the city. And it happens to be in our neighborhood. The omakase is amazing. We go about once every other month.  Read more always amazing to enjoy a meal at Sushi of Gari.  I'd recommend the Sushi bar.  As a sushi enthusiast, I can confidently say that dining at Sushi of Gari is always a special culinary experience.
First you are always greeted with a welcoming greeting.
The sushi is a work of art, showcasing the freshest ingredients, from the buttery texture of the sashimi to the perfectly seasoned rice of the nigiri, every bite was a perfect combo of flavor and texture.

The separate omakase pieces was a true culinary journey.

Of course, such a dining experience comes with a price tag to match. And I can say with certainty that every penny was well worth it for the quality and service provided. Read more Excellent food! New crepe chocolate cake dessert is a wonderful addition to the menu and very delicious.
My favorite sushi in Manhattan. Also, they did some improvements to the decor and it looks much nicer. Read more Always delivers a great meal and great service. We try to get there every time we’re in New York.  High standard great experience every time we go. Service staffs were very attentive. Food was well prepared and fresh.  I have been here many times over the years and was very disappointed with the service . Waitress forgot items we orderred, bus servers tried to clear plates multible times that had food on them.
40 minues in, 15 minutes after food was served we were harassed to the point of being poked in the back by bus boy.
Will never go back, really need to look at this new policy . You lost a customer of over 10 years, and other reviews reveal this is systemic. Read more Excellent Japanese food. But a bit expensive. I guess that’s inflation.  Very expensive and some of the fish didn’t taste fresh.  For the price, the food was not great.  I love this place. I always come when I am in New York City. It’s just a beautiful experience.  Good sushi, but I have had that caliber of fish many places that weren’t nearly as expensive. Seems unnecessary",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/50989069.webp

We were a group of 5. We were there on a Saturday afternoon so we had the brunch menu. Two of us ordered the Eggs Benedict. We were very disappointed. The eggs were not runny but firm and the sauce was scanty. The potatoes were good. The bread basket was excellent ($18). The reason I booked this restaurant was to have a popover. I have gone to David Burke restaurants ( downtown, and Bloomingdale’s ) and the popovers were fabulous and included with the meal. Now they are a separate charge hence the $18 bread basket.

When I tell you the vibes were great! I mean it. I’m writing this because I wish I saw this review somewhere. When you walk in.. classy! Everything is done right. Again, perfect mix of romantic and fun. You can dress in a nice suit. Take your girl and impress her.

Only reason this review is 4 stars is because the food was really good. But not great. But honestly for the price I think I’m gonna change my review to 5 stars. Don’t get me wrong. I spent a good amount. But I think to find these vibes somewhere else you’d spend more. Read more Everything was delicious. Food came out really fast. Miguel was super attentive and gave great recommendations.  Great ambience and very good quality of food!
Definitely a place where to go when in NYC.  We hebben erg lang op ons eten moeten wachten. Eten was gemiddeld qua kwaliteit.

Crispy Cauliflower Lollipops – 9/10: The presentation was cute, and they tasted sooo good!

Filet of Beef – 10/10: Melts in your mouth—so flavorful!

Excellent and eclectic menu options. We had the dim sum sampler tasting menu and each of the six included were excellent. We also had two of the noodle dishes which were very good. Our only issue was that we couldn’t finish both entrees since the dim sum were so filling (one shared entree would have been sufficient). Attentive, but not intrusive, and efficient service. A very nice dining area although it is a bit darker than it needs to be. Definitely worth a visit! Read more It’s nice to have dinner there on Sunday, it is a quiet day rather than Saturday. I love the ambience and service. The foods and drinks are ok.  The food was excellent.  The ambiance a little over the top.  Service was okay.  My girls food came first and my food came 15 minutes after , they try to make it up by giving me free stuff but service should be better  I have come here several times for the amazing one of a kind ambience. I feel like Alice in Wonderland.

They are charging Madison Avenue prices on 3rd Ave. Similar to how La Voglia (a few blocks up) had to revise their menu prices to keep people coming back, they will too. They only have beer and wine right now, but that should change too in the next week or two. being on the UES, they need a kids menu, and need to have plastic cups for kids.

When a private event is going on, you shouldn't allow customers to place online reservations that you can't fulfill. It's really that simple.

They made my husband's burger just the way he likes it and he commented that the french fries tasted fresh cut.
The Hi Life Salad was perfectly designed with every vegetable I prefer. I did not have ro ask for any additions. Also, I ordered it without the new potatoes and dressing. It was terrific. The frozen strawberry dacharis were well blended, thick and tasted the same ; the second one just as well made as the first. Overall- all fresh high quality food portioned just right.

The staff was anxious to please but there was definitely a language barrier (or it was too noisy to u sweat and?). That’s mostly irrelevant as the food was delicious. The scallion pancake, a little greasy, was crisp and tasty. Our sushi was well made and clearly fresh. The spicy mayo was provided upon request, no extra charge, as it should be for a condiment. A companion had the teriyaki salmon, which was a nice-sized portion and thoroughly enjoyed.

Our first visit two weeks ago was sublime and we had hoped we had finally found a wonderful Japanese restaurant in our neighborhood. Unusually good sushi and sashimi. Beautiful decor and attentive service. Alas, all that attention to detail has been thrown out the window. What we had been a serene and lovely neighborhood gem now has staff shouting to each other across the room. A platter of ""deluxe sashimi"" was dropped onto the table with no explanation of what fish was what. Plates were sloppily cleared by literally piling them on top of each other right at the table. The young woman at the door is confrontational. This was the second time she could not find our reservation - and then ""saw it"".  At the very least she should learn to smile.

The staff was great, they sat us before our reservation.
Food was great and we had a great time dining outdoors.  I've been coming here for almost 10 years and the venue is consistently good. The fish quality is high, my favorite sashimis are fluke, scallop, sea bass, sea bream (not always available), uni, and ikura. They also have cooked dishes but their forté is really the fish. The service is just amazing, they have the same people working there for years and at some point don't be surprised if you have three nice waiters servicing your table. Everything is pleasant, you can order what you want and they'll make it work for you. For me this is a little gem in this neighborhood. The decor is not the best one I must confess, but that's secondary at this point.

We asked the waiter for a recommendation of sake, they never have given us a bad bottle. We prefer the dry cold sake.

The cocktails were weak and when we finished our drinks, at least 20 minutes passed before anyone came over. There were only 3 tables sat at the restaurant (Friday 830pm) and plenty of staff.

I loved the restaurant  Dinner was delicious! My husband, sister and I shared bucchetta with ripe tomatoes on top. Two salads, a thin crusted pizza and lovely zucchini pasta. A glass or two of Pinot  and a lovely dinner.  Management said they “couldn’t” adjust an air conditioning unit blowing right on us. Never have I ever experienced management not trying to accommodate a guest with regard to air flow/temperature. Ruined our dinner. Read more Great house is great service great menu salad was sparse for the fee as was the pasta dish  my favorite bolognese to ever exist, and pizza !!!  Staff accommodated late guests which I appreciated.  Other than the hostess, who was a bit rude and seemed to be doing us a favor giving us a table, this when we had a reservation AND there were plenty of tables available! It was good. But that was no way to start the experience. I hope they couch the guy Read more Un poco sucio y descuidado el lugar, necesita una remodelación  We live in the neighborhood and often walk by this place, so we finally decided to try it.

There were four of us. Upon arrival, we were escorted upstairs to their top room.

The staircase, which was near the bathrooms, smelled terrible, like a sewer or septic tank leak. If it hadn’t been pouring outside, we would have left. Luckily once upstairs, we could no longer smell it.

I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad with pine nuts ($19) and added hot grilled chicken (an additional $8). The goat cheese was cold, not warm. The chicken tasted okay but was also cold, and there were no pine nuts.

We ordered the focaccia bread from the appetizers and were disappointed. The bread was flat (like pizza dough) drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary. I asked if this was the free bread or the focaccia we ordered and was told it was focaccia. The waitress seemed annoyed and went to speak to our waiter. He came back with an attitude and asked if everything was okay. I perceived his anger and kindly replied that everything was fine, but I was confirming that the flatbread was indeed the focaccia described on the menu because it didn’t look or taste like traditional focaccia. He responded curtly, saying, “Well, that is the focaccia bread we make here!”

Two people in our party ordered pizza: one regular Margherita pizza and one D.O.C. Margherita pizza. The pizzas were not good. They tasted like frozen pizza.  Both had the same low-quality mozzarella cheese (don’t bother paying extra for D.O.C). BTW: The pizza crust tasted exactly the same as the “focaccia bread” we ordered.

The fourth person ordered the gnocchi. She said they were “okay,” nothing special, with the biggest negative being the sauce was a big sweet.

Overall, the service was ok, but the food was mediocre. If you’re looking for good pizza and Italian food, you should skip this place. There are many good Italian restaurants in the area. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/26104491.webp

Please consider this your food is good , your decor is amazing , your service it’s superb but the ambiance noise level it’s truly disconcerting, we left early   Just for that reason. Read more We had guacamole to share. I ordered the Pecao Frito and my partner ordered the Jalao Pasta. I have zero complaints about the food taste. The drinks were also good. I had a Santo Dominicano which I didn’t like so much but not because of taste but because I don’t like Espresso Martinis (I was not paying attention when I read the description). I also had the Morir Sonando. I highly recommend it. Not sugary.  Nice blend of flavors. Our server, Yelina was also great. She checked on us and even tried to redeem the one issue I had.

Now to the issue. They brought out my partner’s food and I didn’t mind because I figured mine would be coming out shortly after. Wrong! I sat and waited. Finally someone came in our vicinity and I told them that I hadn’t gotten my main course yet. They were apologetic. I thought okay surely it will come out any moment now. Sometimes you get busy and forget. Wrong again! In total it took approx. 45 mins AFTER my partner got their meal before mine finally arrived. I know that’s no fault of our server and every bit on the kitchen. Not quite sure I would be back as I feel like I was forgotten about for way too long.

Over rated, most definitely not authentic Dominican cuisine, ordered the plate that define any Dominican kitchen , sancocho and at best was ok, not even good. The appetizers were good but the main course was not good at all. 
Pork belly(chicharrón) was flavorless so was my churrasco, no sauce or dressing for the proteins on the side.
Service was not attentive at all, it has a lot to do with the fact that the tip is built into the bill, no effort to make the customer feel great and provide the expected service.
Price was too much for the product offered. They should stop claiming typical Dominican cuisine because is far from it. Read more Read more Me gustó mucho la comida., y el servicio del Personal excepcional  Second time there and it was as wonderful as the first time.  Love the drinks , decorations and Food was great!!  The food could've tasted better and there weren't too many options. Service was good though.  Went to Jalao with my wife and what a disappointment this place was.  The overall look of the restaurant is nice, upon entering there are a few Dominican staples that were amusing, like the “bouquet” of rolos hanging from the ceiling.
As Dominicans we always want to support anything that grows the Dominican presence.
But that’s as far as this place goes. We waited nearly 20 minutes to get service, the waitress provided the worst service we’ve ever experienced, once the order was placed, we waited another 15 minutes to get our drinks, which by the way an ingredient was missing so I had to choose something else.  the food was not worthy of being typical Dominican, I would have gotten better quality food by going to El Malecon which is a short walk away.
Food was overpriced and not even properly cooked.
I had the Paila Jalao, it was just an average meal, the steak was overcooked and the chicharon was mostly fatty meat.
My wife had the Chivo con moro, the chivo was not properly cooked and not properly clean, you can smell the meat and not in a positive way.
When it was time to pay the bill, my wife had to get up  from our table and hunt the waitress down so we could get the bill, YES READ THAT AGAIN.
We will never visit this place again!! Read more Very cool spot. Service was great, food and drinks were great too. Also on-site parking was a plus. Definitely worth a visit  Great service, amazing food and good drinks....Can't get any better than that!!  Food was delicious. Restaurant itself was pretty. Service was lacking. We were seated an hour before we had our order taken.  What a change! Nothing was elevated about this experience. I visited Jalao in Sept of 2023 with a group of friends for a late dinner and had a great experience so I decided to bring my mother and aunts for a dinner celebration tonight 4/17/24. Unfortunately, we had a negative experience. The service was poor. The waiter who was also the bartender was not attentive and unprofessional on various occasions. Clearly, they did not value their 5:30 dinner reservations. The quality of the food was not great and the appetizers came out cold. Perhaps a change in chefs? As I write this review, I am experiencing stomach ache and cramps so I most definitely ate something that was bad. Needless to say I will not be back nor would I recommend this place again.

When I asked to move to a different table, I was told that the other table was for a large group. Later they say 2 SEPARATE couples there. They lied. We were very uncomfortable sitting very close to others. While there were other tables not being used. We had to move the whole table just to get up. Food is very good.

pleasant hostess and mater dri  My experience was excellent 🥰 thank you it was wonderful  It was a great experience for the price and in a really great location. Overall the service was lacking and the noise level was insane. I asked for a new pot of tea since the one i had was bitter since it had over steeped. The waiter brought the new tea pot but didn’t take away the cup full of tea so I couldn’t really pour myself another cup and ended up spilling all over the table which no one noticed nor took care of.

Following dessert being delivered it was just over 20 minutes until I stood up and walked to the waiter to get the check.

Read more They were mostly focused on takeout orders and our waiter never returned after ordering. My friend ordered a second drink and no one ever brought it. We asked someone to check on it and ten minutes later stopped them again to inquire about the drink and he didn’t have an answer. At that point, my friend should have received a free drink for the inconvenience. We didn’t feel like we were being paid attention to at all and the restaurant wasn’t even that busy. I was really disappointed in my dining experience here. Read more Not busy on a Friday night, the food came out pretty quickly, everything was tasty and solid cocktails.  I have been at Wagamama (Murray Hill - 39th Street) for at least 3 occasions to have lunch or dinner with former students. I taught high school orchestra for 39 years and retired in June 2022. I will back there with 2 former students and my wife next Wednesday February 7 at 7 pm. I will make a reservation soon.
~joseph rutkowski Read more Perfect service and delicious food! Like the NYC Restaurant Week menu. Thanks!  Nice staff but the food was just awful. Far worse than I remember from some years ago. I wish it was better as it’s close to where I live, but sadly it’s terrible. Don’t waste your money :(  Excellent food which arrived in speedy fashion. Settling up - not so much. Otherwise five stars.  I got the main pork ramen, and my friend got the chicken ramen. Both had good flavor, but there lacked quite a bit of depth. We would've loved to have a more ""umami"" flavor. The dishes are quite shallow and didn't leave lots of room for savory broth and noodles. There were some ingredients missing in my bowl that were mentioned on the menu.

Everything was great. Our host Roman was very kind and took care of us. Love the location.  The food is great and the staff is awesome!!  Don’t miss this place!!  I really wanted to enjoy this place, as it was recommended to me by several people. They were definitely understaffed, but waiting 35 mins after being seated to even acknowledge we were there is a bit much. 

Food left a lot to be desired. We were a party of three and no one finished their meals (one of us got our entree at the end of the night while everyone else was already finished). So many inconsistencies. Food didn’t taste fresh. 

Won’t be returning. Read more Good food. Friendly service. Worth the trip. Great place to have a conversation over lunch.  I enjoy dining at Wagamama.

Skillet gnocchi and vegan bowl were delicious. Make salad was soooo good.  Be forewarned! We went for Brunch. The food and service were excellent. The ambience was less than stellar because of the parents letting children run around and shriek. By the time we were finished eating there were at least 3 other tables with rambunctious children. It made it difficult to have a civilized conversation. We felt sorry for the wait staff having to maneuver around them and of course having to clean up after them.

Cynthia D. Read more The server Gerson was amazing in all aspects of service - attentive / present / charming and professional. I have been here so many times and love the food and ambiance. The only demerit i would give is the hostess was cold / not friendly and dismissive. If i had not already eaten here and known that it has good food / ambience i would have left. She was rude to my partner and myself by not being inviting- almost like she was doing us a favor by letting us dining there. We eat out everyday and the hostess is the first person to greet a customer in a restaurant so should be warm / friendly and inviting which she was not - she gave us the aura that she felt she was above us. She was very good looking tall slender African american with short blonde hair . I am so detailed with the description because I truly wanted to tell her off due to the initial energy she gave us . Luckily our server saved the day with his warm friendly energy which made me feel less embarrassed about suggesting this place for brunch.

Playa Betty's was the perfect choice for a fun, quick meal before the show.

We started with the Mexican grilled corn (YUM) and a few Frozen Painkillers and the Betty's Ritas.  Most of us ordered their Dos Tacos special (the short rib taco was excellent).

Then I asked the bartender to serve me a Margarita with Blanco “Tequila Ocho Plata” and Grand Marnier. He said  okay that’s a Cadillac. Then he prepared the Margarita on his bar area and then walk up to me and reached on the counter for the Grand Marnier bottle and pour it over the drink. But I never saw him with the bottle of the tequila I asked for. Later I asked another bartender if she can show me the bottle of “Tequila Ocho Plata” and she had to reach it from the counter and showed me the bottle.

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**  The menu isn’t overly complicated, but there are plenty of really tasty options to choose from.  The appetizers and cocktails were excellent.  The food was delicious, as always. BUT, while the service staff were friendly and attentive, stuff was slow in being served. My husband’s Old Fashioned was made too sweet with half the liquid being simple syrup. AND, after paying $74/serving for Sole, I was told that I could not substitute a vegetable for the potatoes (I am not supposed to eat carbs for health reasons). It’s not nice to nickel and dime customers!

We have been eating at The Atlantic Grill for years. We were extremely disappointed. Read more I am a regular here pre theater. The food and service are excellent. One caveat, the prices are very very high and entrees do not come with sides.  Very good restaurant for dinner before a performance at Lincoln Center.
Our main courses were excellent: crab ravioli with clams and two sushi rolls. Salad with artichoke was good but light on artichoke shavings and cheese.
Wait staff was very nice but wait time for food to arrive was a little slow.
For someone with food restrictions or a picky eater, some of the dishes that sounded good on the menu couldn't be modified, thus limiting choices.
Lovely non-alcoholic cocktail. Read more We had a 6PM reservation for an 8PM curtain and the service was so poor we barely had time to finish our dinner.   Totally unacceptable!

Went for dinner before concert and made sure waitress knew. Still our main courses took almost an hour, and when they arrived were cold after having obviously sat for ages. A Gibson martini was made with onion brine in the drink proper. Never again. Read more Uneven service, food was not as good as we remembered.  Not a good experience.
Very poor service. We told both the host and the server that we had a curtain time at LC, and even so we had to repeatedly ask for a server to take our order and then to ask about our food, and as a result we were unnecessarily rushed to eat our food and leave on time. We had to ask for the check several times and only got the check when we stood up and started to leave without paying.
The food was just okay. Read more We had a 6:30 reservation, showed up at 6:30 and were told they could not seat us but could seat us at another restaurant owned by the same company.  The other restaurant looked bad so we waited to sit at Atlantic Grill.  The food has definitely gone downhill (we have eaten here for years).  In particular, the mussels had a lot of sand in them.  
This was one of our favorite restaurants and I regret that it is now off our list. Read more The attention by our was terrible.   And there were very few diners!  As usual, food was fine in a beautiful setting.  We found it overall expensive for the food offered.  Especially the drinks. We ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

We assumed the price would be the same as the unavailable wine, but were charged $29 + tax + tip for the one glass. A Ketel One Martini was $22.  We had two appetizers and two main courses. No desert. Altogether the tab with tax and tip was over $200 which we found overpriced.  The food was tasty and very good. Read more They had a rough night. Service weak, food came out before cocktails, everyone there seemed frantic and there werent many customers so not sure why.
That said, food was good. The plantains and guac especially.

Grazie al fantastico Andrea che è riuscito a farci sentire a casa a New York.  The ambience and food were excellent but the service was uneven and impacted the quality of the experience  Before remodeling was more of a seafood restaurant. Now, only a couple of selections and they were only OK.  It was not what I expected.  It took forever to get our oysters as an appetizer, and for my Mediterranean salad they actually forgot to add artichokes (which is why I ordered it) and they served me a small bowl of them to add.  The lobster spaghetti looks good and sounds good, but was bland. Read more There were only 4 tables with diners. We asked that he music be turned down. It wasn’t. Dessert took 15+ minutes to arrive despite our saying we had to leave by a certain time.
The food was acceptable, but not at all special. We’ve eaten here many times because of the proximity to Lincoln Center. I don’t know if we’ll go again. Read more It wasn't until we were ordering food that the server told us there was no sushi at all, even though they have a very large sushi menu. That should've been communicated at the time we were seated. Read more Excellent and attentive service with a pleasant and quiet atmosphere because of Restaurant Week during the heart of the summer.  Server Luis was outstanding and extremely attentive to our needs. I will request his table the next time I dine at Atlantic Grill. The last time I ate here it was the polar opposite and frenetic considering the Easter Sunday holiday.  This was a gazillion  times better and the food was definitely memorable and delicious; so good that we took home the tasty morsels even though we were going to the LC theater. Read more Three of had dinner and drinks on a Tuesday night. Unfortunately, the place was dead. Plenty of staff, but no customers. I say 1-2 tables occupied.  Sad.

I specifically asked for my Halibut to be lightly cooked; that fish dries out in seconds. It’s difficult to cook properly.  Unfortunately mine was overcooked, and the manager understood and was very gracious. They cooked me a second dinner.  Note that the broccoli side dish was barely warm.

Unfortunately, I was re-served after my dining companions had finished their dinners.  That made for an uncomfortable evening.

But I’m pleased with the service and manager’s concern and response. Read more Very friendly staff, great ambiance, good food. We were celebrating someone’s birthday and they made sure to treat us above and beyond. Will come back again!  I have been to the Atlantic Grill many many times over the years.   The last 3 times the service was non professional and slow ...we waited much to long for out food and the food was not hot enough.  We will not be going back again till we find out that the service has improved.

The staff clearly were not trained well and looked awkward and didn't know what to do and they served the appetizers with the main meal.  We still gave a good tip because we felt that it was the responsibility of the store to train there employees and the staff was cordial and warm they just were not professional.

Service not at the same level  We usually love this place but the service last night was horrible!! We sat at the bar and could barely get a drink without flagging someone down.  It definitely was not a busy night!   great that we could dine outdoors - sunny and comfortable.  Inside was very noisy.  Went for lunch . Had great, friendly service and the food was excellent. We will go back on our next trip.  Excellent food and service.  I highly recommend Del Fresco's Grill!!  Great food, excellent choice of wines. Friendly and helpful staff 👌  Amazing experience as always thank you. Even without the systems up and running the whole time still was effective in getting our food out and able to accommodate regardless  All the food was very salty... the Made to Share Roasted Buffalo Wings, the Braised Short Rib and the Heritage Pork Chop all the food was impossible to eat...

He made our visit memorable.  Miserable dinner. The server was not friendly. 
We needed to ask to order, they forgot to give us the wine list. We were outside with no lights.

A disaster. Read more Came here because we heard great things. Wasn’t very impressed at all. Food was subpar for the price and restaurant seemed a little dirty and run down.

The food is basic, service is good.
Not comparable to Del Frisco Double Eagle Steakhouse, much lower quality .  Third time eating here, first time outside. Food & service keep me coming back.  The calamari appetizer would have been better if it were hot, but delicious all the same. I'll be back.  We were unsure what to expect when we made our reservations.  We had been to more popular Del Frisco's, but not the Grille location before, but the main location had no availability during the time we were looking for, so we decided to try the Grille, and we were not disappointed.  When we arrived the place was not busy for dinner, so we were nervous, but our waiter was prompt, friendly,  and made some very good recommendations. We ordered 2 apps, a salad, mash potatoes and shared a steak.  That was plenty of food for 2 people.  Both apps (the crab cake and the ribs), as well as the Ceasar salad was delicious.

2) Order of Rigatoni.   Tasty but small
3) Ordered Filetto Di Branzino.   The fish was very small and dried out.  Waiter advised side dish was roast vegetables.   I had to return fish as was inedible and was asked by waiter if I wanted something else.  I ordered Spaghetti san marzano tomatoes, garlic,basil, olive oil.

The food was delicious, we had a great wine. It is a nice space, perfect for quiet conversation.  My husband’s chicken Milanese was delicious.  The vegetables tasty.  Your restaurant is charming, though plain.

What is driving my rating is I asked two different servers if the Branzino was grilled or pan seared/sauteed.  Both said grilled.  The fish came and had been cooked in a pan on the stove, not grilled; it was soggy from the butter or oil, which is why I asked about grilling because I won’t eat fish unless it’s grilled.  Whether your servers don’t understand the cooking process or don’t understand English, I don’t know.  Your staff was kind enough to take the cost off our check, for which I’m grateful.  I would advise you to make sure your staff knows how food is prepared.

He also went above and beyond to make sure the sauce for the suckling pig dish I chose didn't use any beef due to my allergy. Unfortunately, it did and we had to pick something else 😕 But whyyy if it's a pork dish? I really wanted to try that dish. Everything else was tasty, and flavors were perfectly balanced. Just a few notes... A bit too much fennel on the salmon dish, the striped bass was a tiny bit over cooked, maybe make the skin crispy to take away the ""fishy"" taste to level up the dish a bit and the hazelnut dessert had way too much cream overpowering the chocolate and other flavors. Will certainly be back to try out other things.

Service too fast, serving water at all moment and food just regular, almost industrial  Wonderful dining experience at every level. Everyone was extraordinary and the service impeccable.  Somewhat disappointed with my choices on the prix fix $135 dinner. 
The tuna tartar presentation was lovely but lacked any flavor. Adding lemon had no effect.
The agnolotti had a lovely sauce but the first bite was overly salty.

I highly recommend Backstage Tavern. High Marks all-around. Located in the theatre district on the nicest street in the area.

Beers: excellent and varied. My companions advise me the cocktails are interesting & outstanding. I am not sure what 'interesting' means for a cocktail, but I can say the word was used with enthusiasm. The food is excellent.  Fresh, flavorful & interesting. With food I understand interesting & it applies here to the ingredients and the varied sauces. They had me at the addictive Triple Threat Taters (black truffle oil, garlic, parmesan & garlic confit) and closed the deal with a very tasty, unusual twist on deviled eggs.  Next trip: larger group: 'share table' with  plates of tacos, wings & TATERS. My vegetarian wife loved the roasted sweet potato, black beans & avocado tacos. I enjoyed them all, but 1st prize to the carne asada. Everyone enjoyed the experience & my nephew has been back a few times with his work crowd.  The 'clean corner' of the menu includes a 'garden wrap' & my wife said the glazed tofu was perfectly prepared & complimented by the other ingredients.  I loved the very tender Steak Frites & used every last bit of the garlic confit and herb butter. I could say more, but this review has limits. Leave room for desert (cheesecake!) I am glad to write this review as much for the customers as the business.  I have no affiliation with the Backstage Tavern other than as a satisfied customer.  After a number of visits & a friendly chat with the manager, we decided to have our 40th Wedding Anniversary in their upstairs area. It was a great decision & a great time.

The fries were good too. They weren't greasy or overcooked, but just right. We also had the jerk shrimp tacos which had a little heat.

Starting out in Manhattan’s East Village as a spot-on rendition of a casual New England fish shack, The Mermaid Inn has morphed into an American seafood brasserie, replete with style, hospitality and a menu marked by bold and seasonally inspired cuisine. The Mermaid Inn has been designed to evoke the feeling of being on a mini vacation in a small seaside village.","Read more One of our party showed up terribly late, yet the staff continued to attend to us and await our late guest.  The lobster knuckles were a quick hit.  And the cod entree was outstanding.  The key lime tart is just the right size and delicious.  Above all the service was impeccable.  The Parker House rolls are a delight but way overpriced.  Nice wine selection by the glass which fit our group perfectly.  It would be complete if the skate wing always appeared on the menu, but alas, it is only offered as a special (and not last night). It is sorely missed.  Overall this is a seriously outstanding restaurant in theater district. Read more Really fantastic Times Square pre/post theatre option. Most other options are just trying to squeeze the tourists - this place really cares. Great food, great service. Highly recommend!  The staff is very prompt and polite, and the food was out of this world. Take a moment to consider the daily specials because the items not featured on the menu were phenomenal.  Glad I found this place!  Great location for a pre show meal.  I had some of the best oysters I’ve ever had.  It’s clean, nice and the staff couldn’t be any friendlier.  Service has gone down a bit.  Normally the waiters ask if you are headed to a show so they know how to pace the food.  Our waiter barely checked on us.  We were looking for him when we wanted to order and he barely checked on us later.

Also what is it with the tiny cups with no ice for sparkling water?  Some changes were made to the menu for the salmon and free range chicken, which are not the best.  Wish they would bring back the old menu as it was what kept a bunch of us coming for lunch.  The after dinner drinks should also be on the regular drink menu.  There were some on there we would have ordered had we seen them sooner. Read more We reserved a table and were promptly seated. Then we didn’t see a server for 15 minutes only after going to the hostess desk. Great value in a happy hour that ran from 4 to 5:30.! All food received two thumbs up from our guests. Noise level required a yelling conversation akin to a wedding when the band plays way too loud. Read more Beautiful spot yummy food esp happy hr. Very attentive service. Very enjoyable experience.  Wonderful place for pre Theater dinner.  They  know you need to be served  quickly but understand how to make it a relaxing meal at the same time.  Our waiter immediately came to tell us we had one minute left on happy hour menu which was above and beyond.  Only issue here is the noise level and considering this is not the Mermaid Inn's first establishment, I don't understand how they did not construct the restaurant  keeping that in mind.  Unless I was meeting someone for pre Theater, I would never go here with a friend for a meal...so noisy, what a shame. Read more We love the food and the peaceful, casual vibe here.  Had family in town for a pre-theater dinner.  They were blown away by the food.  Dinner arrived quickly, but didn't feel rushed.  Read more Would not go back to Mermaid Oyster Bar. We went during happy hour and experienced long wait times on getting attention from the servers. It wasn't that they didn't have time to address us. It seemed like they were just totally disconnected from the needs and experience of the people sitting at the bar. Very strange experience.

Great ribs, oysters and Super Service. Waiter was fantastic  The service and food are outstanding.  We ordered the great grand platter which was fantastic.  This was our first time here. We both enjoyed it. We started with a dozen oysters that were excellent. We shared the lobster knuckles appetizer which was truly outstanding. I had the seared yellowfin tuna and my husband had the branzino. They were both great. I highly recommend this place. We’ll be back! Read more Our server Janine was excellent. The happy hour menu is a great deal. Oysters were amazing as was New England clam chowder and the fish tacos didn’t disappoint. The fried calamari was a little heavy on the breading and a bit greasy.

Best linguine & clams I've had in NYC! Read more Clam linguine and cod with mussels were both excellent  This was our first time at the Mermaid Oyster Bar. Right from entering the smartly decorated restaurant we had a very positive vibe. Our server was David and I have to say he was one of the best servers we have ever had. He knew the menu in and out and made great recommendations when we asked. He was not intrusive but yet was always checking on us to insure we didn’t need anything. The manager Steve was constantly walking around the restaurant to make sure all the customers received what they needed. I had the yellowfin tuna and my wife had the Bronzino. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. We also had the oysters and shrimp cocktail. My only complaint is that the shrimp were somewhat tasteless and seemed previously frozen.

Food was tasty  The food is amazing, the  room is amazing, our waiter David was attentive, friendly and so nice to look at. Will be back again.  We had tickets to “& Juliet” for Sunday at 6:30. I usually try to select a restaurant near the theater so as not to be late due to traffic or slow service. The theater was on 43rd Street so I went on yelp and The NY Times for reviews. Mermaid Bar and restaurant had good reviews and a menu where I found dishes that I knew I would enjoy. I am a seafood lover, but my husband is not, so I had to make sure there were dishes he could order. (Aren’t I considerate?) There were, so I made reservations for 4:15 (early I know) so as not to be late for the show.
The restaurant was fairly empty at that hour so we were seated quickly and advised that they had a happy hour until 5:30. We ordered three appetizers from the happy hour menu (oysters, clams, and salmon tartare) as well as drinks.
After our appetizers, I ordered fish tacos while my husband chose a burger. Being that it was prior to 5:30 when we finished eating, we each had a second drink.
The food and drinks were good, and service was great.

Food is excellent.  Cocktails well crafted.

For the first time, last night our table was not ready well past our reservation time.  Place was packed and we had to wait in the hotel lobby.  This was disappointing as 2 of my group had hard stops - so the more time past our reservation, the less time we had to enjoy.

Service more than made up for the inconvenience, tho, once we were seated.  Staff is lovely and so friendly it was hard to harbor any resentment.

Will continue to enjoy this place!! Read more We had the pre-theater menu and everything was absolutely delicious - flavor in every bite!  Great time with friends.

Celebrated my 30th birthday here. It was amazing! Delicious gluten free options, loved the lychee martinis, had the best time because the vibe was right. Will absolutely be returning  Read more I went during resturaunt week as did many other diners there to be given a regular menu and told that they are not participation in it. I watched a couple literally walk out after.  We felt rushed by the waiters despite the restaurant being half empty. We weren’t even done with our appetizers and the bus boy was trying to remove our plates to give us new plates and silverware for the main course. 2/3 of us got very sick from dinner (not quite sure what dish it was that did it) Read more I will preface this with stating that O was a bartender for 10 years at a fine dining restaurant and my tolerance for busy, cranky, service is pretty high.  We went to Kyma at 5:00 pm and were the only people on the restaurant side for about 30-40 min.  Our server started out really rude and seemed put out by having to serve us.  I order a cocktail and was told that they would not make me one of their dragon queen drinks with vodka instead of gin be ause they already had it premade. At a beautiful restaurant where you pay $20 a drink before tax and tip I would expect to be able to make a simple modification.  When we tried to place appetizer orders we were not allowed to until we knew our dinner order- again this is strange to me- we were not ordering off the prix fix menu- why not let us put in appetizers immediately- we were starving- and wanted to start asap.  The food was OK.  I had the lobster pasta- and it was really sweet- almost like they used sugar instead of salt.  My husband had the seafood orzo.  The ambience was moody and fun- and the place was filled up by 6pm.   For $300 I expect a better experience-  I will stick to AVRA for greek/Mediterranean dining. Read more Excellent food. Price is fairly good, especially for restaurant week. Steaks were really well prepared, octopus appetizer was phenomenal. Amazing service as well!!  Service is great, as well as the vibes. But food was really bad…  Robbie was the best!! He really made our night perfect and I can't thank him enough for the hospitality!  Great lunch option in the area. Price-fixe has very good options. Whole meal is very enjoyable.  Neighborhood gem!
Always great food.   Always great service. 
Never a bad time.  The food was not good at al — the pita served when we sat down was hard, the octopus made us sick and the French fries were soggy with oil. We spent over $100 a person for lesser quality food than casual Greek restaurants like Souvlaki GR. Multiple servers came over to clear our appetizer plates when we clearly were not done to rush us out which was stressful. Read more absolutely amazing!

Our table had “campers” and they made our wait in the bar area very pleasant. They kept track of us and it felt caring. Food was delicious.

Incredibly loud. We had to ask to be moved from the main dining room to the bar room because 2 of us started to get a migraine headache

Food was ok.

- Tempura & bread apps very nice
- Lambs overly spiced & overcooked (chef recommmeded medium)
- Hangar steak was hard to identified w all the spices & overcooking (asked for medium rare)

We will return some day. Read more Honestly this was pretty mediocre for what was expected to be a nice city restaurant. It was quiet and clean but the service was spotty. The seabass was basically a slab of fish on a plate swimming in oil. The drink with a mushroom in it was supposed to be earthy but tasted like beef bouillon with alcohol mixed in. Read more The service was really good! Our waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations. The drinks were awesome! We asked for a mojito which was off menu and it was incredible. We were with a group of 4, each of us got something different and it was all so good. Everyone’s plate wiped clean lol we will definitely be back! Read more We were disappointed all the way around with this restaurant.  The hostess in the bar was fairly rude and didn't even acknowledge me when I entered. She walked by me a couple of times and didn't ask if she could help or even say hello.  When the person who seemed to be her boss saw me she was much more friendly and helpful.  We were seated promptly and our server was pleasant but didn't seem to know much about the menu.  The appetizer we ordered didn't even remotely resemble what she had described and was not very good (I still don't know what it was).  One of the guests in our party ordered a whisky drink and he said it tasted like apple cider (he thinks they forgot the whisky!).  I had the lamb and it was delicious and cooked perfectly (one star for that!).  My husband had the steak and the waitress offered to put the jalapeno chimichurri on the side when he asked how it was served.  He said, yes that would be great because he was a bit hesitant about it.  When the food came out the steak was covered with the chimichurri.  The runner offered to take it back and scrape it off, but my husband declined (he could scrape it off himself).  The steak was completely overpowered by the jalapeno and not at all what he wanted.  The meal wasn't inexpensive so you would expect much better execution  and more courteous staff.  We won't go back... Read more Food took a very long time but it was delicious .  It was a bit difficult to find the restaurant.  The sign on the street was tiny and it is inside a hotel with a different name. We walked into the bar and said we had dinner reservations - so the hostess sent us to the roof. When we got to the roof the hostess there checked our name and sent us back downstairs.  The original hostess then sat us in the bar and I explained we had dinner reservations.  She said this was fine.  Then I asked about the Prefix and she went to get someone else.  A young man appeared to take us to the dining room. It was all a little weird.
I ordered the Heirloom Tomato salad and hanger steak. I'm not sure the tomato was a ""heirloom"" and it wasn't very ripe. Disappointing.  It was served with too much basil mousse. The hanger steak was decent. 
Service was very good except for the beverage server who came to our table and refilled the water glasses EVERY (no exaggeration)  time we took a drink. It was disruptive.

Favorite: Hamachi, Herloom tomato, Hanger steak and castella cake.  Really nice and calm atmosphere with friendly staff. It’s a hidden gem definitely coming back soon.  Food was very good but for a hotel the service was lacking. Waited over 15 mins for our drinks and additional 30 mins for our food. They brought the wrong drink and even charged it wrong on the bill. In general, not the level of professionalism we expected from a restaurant in such a nice hotel.
Also we noticed that people were constantly moving tables because they were seated directly under the AC and others put on jackets. Maybe if nearly all guests are cold it would be a good call to turn the AC down. Read more Our second time dining here and it was a very nice evening. Food was interesting and delivered quickly, the tomato salad & the steak were the standouts. The restaurant is a pretty space with a lively bustle, dining early might be preferable for noise.

Good for a small group dinner where you want to chat.  Despite a late reservation after a concert, staff was friendly and did not rush our meal.  We had a wonderful meal and excellent dining experience.  The service was top-notch.  The only negative was that, as we were walking in, a woman walked in ahead of us with a very large and hairy dog that she clearly intended to keep at her table.  The host, instead of seating her outside, allowed her to sit at a table indoors.

The service is impeccable and the food is delicious and authentic. I highly recommend this restaurant.  My favorite restaurant in the neighborhood I just didn’t order a good meal for me  I had a few issues with this restaurant:
1.  I could tell the waiter’s English was not that great because he really didn’t understand my requests and it caused a discrepancy on the bill, which was corrected.
2.  When you ask for a glass of wine, you expect anywhere from $13-21.  When I got the bill, it said a whopping $34 for 6 oz of wine.  The waiter deliberately, unbeknownst to me, gave me the most expensive on the menu.  I felt that was dishonest and outlandish!!  I told the manager, and he was very nice and removed the charge which I appreciated.
3.  For a NYC Italian restaurant, and being a born and bred in NYC, the food was mediocre.  I felt like it was a tourist trap where people don’t know any better.
4.  The restaurant is beautiful and clean with a great ambiance.

At the end of the day, I would not go back here as the prices for everything were extremely expensive and the food was “meh.” Read more Bit over priced for the quality and portion size.

Along with the that the service is incredibly slow and they are not attentive. I will definitely not be back. Read more This was my first visit to this newly opened UES steak house.  Very impressive interiors and moderate ot low noise level.  The food was excellent quality.  Shrimp Cocktail, Lump Crabmeat, and the filet were all outstanding.

Our second time there and can’t wait to go back Read more The restaurant is only 2 ½ weeks old. I would caution people against trying it yet.  The kitchen is still not ready. Took us an hour to get our main course. And the staff is still learning.

We did say something and they gave us a substantial discount.  So we will try it again in a month or so. Read more We loved it and we will be back. We were excited to see this venue re-open. They kept most of the inside the same, but updated the furniture and fixtures. They just opened, so they need to shake out a few things, but the food was fantastic. The steak was the best I've had on the UES, and my wife enjoyed the seafood. They are charging Madison Avenue prices on 3rd Ave. Similar to how La Voglia (a few blocks up) had to revise their menu prices to keep people coming back, they will too. They only have beer and wine right now, but that should change too in the next week or two. being on the UES, they need a kids menu, and need to have plastic cups for kids. They could also be a great brunch spot and great for watching sports at the two bars. Read more great ny strip. Tender and flavorful.   Finally a great steak option on UES  Steak was good but they are still working thru their opening. No Liquor License yet and the food didn’t come out hot. I’m sure it will get better and will give it another shot.  Excellent! I have been missing this restaurant location since it was The Parlour, and I was so excited to see it open again under the new name and menu! The interior is freshly updated, with the steakhouse vibe and nice lighting and is similar layout and seating as the previous restaurant. The service was very attentive! The menu boasts great options and wines. The halibut was outstanding as was the tartare! Overall, a wonderful experience and I'm excited to go back! Read more Both the food and the service were very good.  The service was fast, attentive and friendly.  Food was mediocre at best. We send back 2 typical items that were terrible. The staff were very nice and accommodating. To open an expensive restaurant on the upper east side, you must have delicious food to last, Catch n Chop does not. I won't be back.

Recommended.  The food is delicious. Need more vegetarian options please!!  Our ""entree"" course of Sushi rolls went missing! This was ordered before we started the meal (& was our 3rd course). 
The first 2 courses were served, our table was reset for a sushi course, and after waiting >20 minutes we ""flagged down"" our waiter & he said it was coming ""shortly"".  I was sitting facing the kitchen & the 3 chefs preparing Sushi dishes were not busy. Within 2-3 minutes of my telling our waiter, 1 of the 3 Sushi chefs started working on our dish (laughing with the other 2 chefs); apparently they knew someone had screwed up.

Had a 6:15 reservation, and did get seated on time. Placed at a table by the window, but behind a huge column. Asked to get reseated at an empty table, and were told it was a $25 up charge for a table by the window. When my husband expressed disappointment with that, since we were guests of the hotel for 2 nights, they did reseat us one table forward, so at least we weren’t behind an obstruction. None of the window tables had reserved signs on them, and the only thing we had read was that window seats could not be guaranteed. Understood. But when you arrive at an early dining time, and there are empty tables, why not be nice to your guests and give them a nice table? Our food was good, steak for my husband and branzino for me. Typical New York City prices. High priced, and it had 3 sports TV’s going. Not a romantic dining spot. Read more We asked the waiter if there was a cabernet house wine. We were told yes. The table had 3 glasses of wine total and the charge for the three glasses of wine was $87. The wine list showed much cheaper prices for cabernets. We were cheated.

Was asked repeatedly if we were staying at the hotel. We were not. I'm not sure what difference it makes if we were staying there or not. I have eaten at the restaurant before, and have stayed at the Marriott Marquis many times. Usually, when I ask for the check, the waiter will ask if we are staying at the hotel to find out if we want to charge the bill to our room.

They held true to that policy as 3 other 2s that came after us. Throughout our stay the four people tables not far occupied stayed empty. They clearly were never going to be occupied or at least not all of them. Given that the 4 people tables can be turned into 2 people tables and the other way around the policy is silly at least on the night we went. They actually yelled at two people for even getting near a 4 person table. There was always capacity to create 4 people tables from 2 people tables should the need have arisen. I didn’t mind our table but the policy is off putting and I will not return until they change their policy. The prices are high for York Avenue so they should take care not to turn away business due to rigid policy that makes diners uncomfortable. There wasn’t a 2 person table that didn’t observe the 4 person tables staying unused and shaking their heads.

However, when I tipped our lovely waitress in cash, some woman came over to my date, not me,  and asked about the tip that wasn’t on the bill.
There was a discussion so to speak, no apology.
Who was she to get in the middle of us and start a scene with all of us?

The food was very good, excellent quality and delicious.

Our only negative observation was that it was difficult to hear yourself speaking as the acoustics were not great. Read more This is a pretty restaurant, whether you sit upstairs or downstairs, but I prefer the brighter upper floor. The salmon covered in poppyseed was delicious and light with broth and an array of mushrooms. Wine by the bottle had some moderately priced selections, and the one we chose was very good. Baby roasted carrots were a very small portion for the price. The salads were small and not good at all, and also pricey. Service was attentive. All in all a fun evening despite some of the younger diners talking very loudly. Wonderful after they left! Not my favorite Jean Georges restaurant, but a pleasing experience. Read more We loved it. Great food and service. We’d happily return.  Just an excellent excellent restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Our server Luna was excellent. Tne atmosphere is cozy and very warm. Great food and reltively good value.  Great time with great food. Only drawback for us is that it’s cozy and gets quite loud  I had a disappointing experience at Jojo. It was my friend’s birthday, and when making the reservation, I left a note requesting a table on the second floor, which would have made the celebration feel a bit more special. The host, however, didn’t acknowledge the note or explain anything when they seated us on the bottom floor. I completely understand if the second floor was at full capacity, but a simple explanation or even a small birthday acknowledgment would have gone a long way. Unfortunately, neither was offered.

To compare, we visited a smaller restaurant later that evening, and the first thing the host did was warmly wish my friend a happy birthday as soon as we walked through the door.

What really left a strange impression was when the bill arrived. The waiter brought the check with a candle on an empty plate. It felt sarcastic, like they were saying, ""Happy birthday, now here’s your bill."" There were no birthday wishes or special touches. For a restaurant of Jojo’s caliber—where we ordered the most expensive dish on the menu—this felt underwhelming.

It’s a decent restaurant, but the lack of hospitality really dampened what should have been a celebratory experience. Read more Read more I loved it and enjoyed EVERY dish! The chef made my best friends birthday celebration a hit.  It was brunch and every table was filled with young women posing for selfies and totally disturbing the tables around them.

The entrance is down the stairs. Upstairs tables are nicer in a high ceiling space.  Lovely atmosphere as well as wonderful service!

Too loud for a business dinner. For business meals, Monterey’s lunch is still excellent, however, as they keep the sound low for the lunchtime crowd.

I’ll go back for the BBQ Head-on Shrimp & Grits & try Fri’s $75 Prime Rib special. Otherwise, Drinks, Fish & steak were average & it was an average experience.

Food was delicious! And fresh!!
The knaffe is a must!
The ground meat kebab in tahini was unique and refreshing, and sent me back to the Druze restaurants I used to visit in northern Israel.
The grape leaves reminded me home, and the hummus was finally as humus should be! Yummy and fresh and in the right consistency. Laffas were amazing. The shawarma and grilled chicken were also good choice. The crispy artichoke wasn’t crispy, but was good, also the tabuli salad.

Service was slaw, but we had good company (I would expect them to have more staff members during the weekend, when the restaurant is full). The problem is that the lack of staff also affects the cleaning level of the tables, chairs, floor, and yes - also the restroom.

I would say that pricing is a bit on the higher side for a super casual restaurant, and for the portions served.
But, again - this is not a standard restaurant, and there is no alternative kitchen that serves this type of food, nevertheless, in such authentic flavors.

Voted Best New Restaurant 2018 by Thrillist - BEST STEAKHOUSE in NYC by NEWSWEEK 2019!","Read more My experience was great but the AC was blasting crazy but food and service was amazing and definitely will be returning to that location  I ordered a medium-well steak but received an overcooked dried steak. I couldn't eat it. The waiter was not attentive at all. The sides were good though.  Our experience was very worthy wild and awesome. I love the customer service, the food was great very elegant and well prepared. Thank you to the awesome staff.  Everything was great, the decor, service and food.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  The service was very accommodating. The food was well prepared and quote tasty!  The worse dining experience I ever had. Extremely poor service.  The entire night was fantastic!
The hostess was wonderful and made us feel  welcome.  It was my wife’s birthday and everyone made her feel special.
We ordered the Surf and Turf for 2 and the Lobster Tails were perfectly cooked.  The Filet Mignon was perfectly medium rare, juicy and tender.
Overall the night was magical, the ambiance was fantastic, the food delicious and well priced!
Definitely coming back when I’m in New York again! Read more Great restaurant! Great food and the staff are great! From the manager, the waiters and the front desk ladies! Thanks for letting me propose to now fiancé! The staff made it all possible! Thank you all! Read more I tried the other location however wanted a new experience at this location. The service was on point, the staff was very attentive & very sharp. The frozen strawberry watermelon froze was amazing. I ordered some lamb chops & had shrimp fried rice, couldn’t eat all so I was able to save some to go food. I will be coming back. Thanks for having me & my best friend Read more We were successfully ignored for 15 min after being seated. We flagged down a bus boy and eventually got waited on. Then, one of the bus boys phones went off in his pocket while he was clearing the table. The food was typically NYC over priced good. This place needs help. Read more Read more Brooklyn chop house is always a go to steakhouse for me. I celebrated my birthday here back in February, have visited both locations here in NYC. Last night I brought a friend from out of town to experience the restaurant. Food and drinks were great. Service was slow. I was done my entrees before the waitress came by to ask if I wanted another drink, I had to flag the busser down to get him to have the waitress come over. Very very slow service. Yes I know it’s a Sunday and it’s a slower shift but come on. I’m a paying customer. Tip is already included in the bill. Service could have been better. Read more Highlights were the hostesses, hospitality, the music, and the cleanliness. Overall good vibes.

All of the food we ordered was mediocre (except for ice cream & sorbet) but maybe we didn’t order well. Filet was chewy, lobster in the fried rice was cooked in some pieces but not all.

Was surprised my notes were not communicated to the server - celebrating a birthday, and pre-theater. But she did an excellent job. Read more Food and ambiance was amazing. 5 stars all the way around!!!!  food was so good just a little pricey but u get ur moneys worth with how good everything is. HIGHLY RECCOMEND THE FRIED RICE best fried rice i’ve ever had. Lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and asparagus was also soooo good. 10/10 would come again. Read more Very blah experience for a steak house
Food wasn’t overly good
Very salty
Service was meh

Manager told my husband to take a hat off- but every single other person inclusive of the servers had hats on? Read more My experience was great. The ambience when you first come in is beautiful they great and they make you feel welcomed.  The food was great , I gave it a 4 Star because a bug unfortunately got in one the plates and we informed her “all of sudden after eating its a bug” if im not mistaken her name was Sanja. That was very rude of her we wasnt asking her to take it back like we didnt want it. But her excuse was it was a fruit fly when we waved our hand over it , it stayed in her food and did not fly away that was no fruit fly. Regardless it was a bug in her food and said because we were near the garden that is no excuse. They ended up giving her a extra rice on the side but still had to pay for a meal she couldnt finish. This was my second experience at this restaurant and will choose to go to the one at nassu street instead this one is more lively at night but plays more of the up to date hip hop the other location for me is better and aged appropriate for me Read more The food was outstanding accross the board!  Ceaser Salad with bacon- delightful and the bacon added a new great twist. The rib eye which we split was extraordinaryly tasty and perfectly cooked. Wong, our wonderful server, recommended the garlic mashed potatos and it was a great recommendation.  The ambiance was quite nice, modern and upscale almost like a science fiction movie. Loved the experience.

My one complaint is the greeting we got qt the door from the doorman and the hostess-- they seemed snarly and not happy to see customers. Thank goodness it all picked up after them.
Management needs to look at the disgruntled staff at the front. Other than that a great dining experience Read more The food was really good. I ordered crab fried rice and Kung pow chicken. The chicken tasted so good and was tender. I also ordered a litchi martini which was delicious. The service was amazing. We had an extremely attentive and knowledgeable server. Read more Three people referred me to Brooklyn Chophouse in Times Square. Very nice restaurant and the food was excellent!  Food was delicious. The place was such a vibe for a night time atmosphere.

Great food
Date night approved or special occasion.  Best Steakhouse experience/food I've ever had.  Great ambience, service and variety of well-seasoned, delish food.  We were sat on the outside patio but the outdoor fans from the buildings were too loud for us to enjoy the moment so we asked to be moved and they were quick and swift about moving us.

I would suggest using that area as an overflow area.overall nice! Read more Food was great. Staff was very friendly. Drinks were good  Honestly one of if not the best restaurants I’ve ever eaten in . The food is immaculate and so is the drinks . Second time visiting and no step off from the last visit. Highly recommend visiting this place. It’s beyond worth it and make sure to bring friends. Portions are big ! But nothing wrong with leftovers. Ate my leftovers and felt like I was still in the restaurant eating it fresh . 10/10 Read more The food was absolutely fantastic , service was fast , food served promptly …. Overall service EXCELLENT .  Love the decor. The wait for the food wasn’t long.  Friend’s Belated Birthday! Food was great, but very pricey.  The young lady at check-in needs retraining.

He was attentive and super sweet 😊  Overall great experience!! Food and service was amazing  Great place to eat before theatre. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was calm.  First time dining at the Glass Tavern Will definitely go back. Very comfortable with good ambiance. Food was delicious & a varied menu.  Cocktail class had a big chip. Replacement was warm. Waitress inattentive. Bathrooms nice & convenient. Steak great. Bread stale. Conveniently located to theaters.  Lovely venue close to the theaters and perfect for an after or pre performance production. Very good choices and service.  First impression was bad because one of our water glasses was stained with lipstick. Servers quickly fixed the problem.  We had a nice time. Food was good, but  party going on so the music was very loud which made having a conversation at our table somewhat difficult. I will definitely try again and hope the music isn’t as loud.

The waitress  lowered volume in our speaker but was still very loud.  Waitress was very nice and very accommodating.  Good theater area restaurant. Read more Our waitress was wonderful. The food was pretty good! We went before a broadway show. I would go again.  Read more After reading many reviews of the restaurants near Times Square for an after matinee dinner, I felt comfortable choosing Glass House Tavern.  My party of four was not disappointed.  The restaurant was quiet at 5:45 pm and we were seated immediately.  Service was excellent.  The menu has a number of options, without being overwhelming.  We had the couscous, salmon tartare and crabcake appetizers, all of which were fine.  Nothing special, but appealing enough.  As entrees, two of us had the duck, which they enjoyed.  I had the short ribs, which I thought were quite good and one of us had the lamb pappardelle, which she seemed to enjoy.  All of that and 2 glasses of prosecco ran us under $300, which feels reasonable.  It's a solid choice amongst many tourist spots around there. Read more Beautiful presentation and the flavors live up to the beauty. We mixed and matched between people who had the Prix Fixe and ordering from the regular menu. Everyone was pleased.  Always a reliably good place to eat in the theater District.  Excellent service and food was amazing. Small portions for the price but we sat upstairs near the windows and loved the atmosphere.  Friendly service. Did not feel rushed. Food was very good.  The nicest and most attentive waiters.  Delicious food and drinks and amazing cheesecake.  Very easy to converse without having to speak loudly  Very nice service and location. Food quite good. Would return pre theatre . Duck and shrimp dishes delicious. Only the Brussels were hard as rocks..should have served spinach. Chocolate lava cake  ala mode was a delicious finish. Read more Everything about this restaurant was good, not excellent, but good. It’s pricey for what you get  What a gem!  Service was excellent and we felt very welcomed by all of the staff.  The food was excellent,  but we were surprised to find one of the 7 things on the limited menu was already sold out at 6pm. Our glasses were left empty on the table for longer than we are accustomed to, given the few occupied tables. Read more Read more Friends and I ate before a Broadway show and the food was amazing. Staff was helpful in recommendations and we had an amazing time. Highly recommend if you’re in the theater district  Nice ambience, excellent service, great food. Would definitely recommend this place!  My husband and I both enjoyed the Prix Fixe menu.  For the appetizer, I had the soup (potato leek), which was unique and delicious.  My husband had the salad, which had lots of different toppings.  We each had a roast chicken breast with carrots and broccolini.  For desert, we had the apple bread pudding with cinnamon Gelato.  Each course was flavorful and well cooked.  Highly recommend. Read more Eh not great. Expensive, no happy hour. Tourist trap.  We came for our anniversary and had the best night. The food was delicious and our server Larry was delightful.  Food was very well prepared and seasoned. Quiet, nice atmosphere. Staff was very attentive.  Our waiter was wonderful. Happy to please. Other staff as well. Only drawback was that it took nearly half hour to get our dessert which made it stressful to get to pick up our theater tickets in a timely way.  Spoiled the good feeling of the evening. Read more Overall food and drinks were average. Our server was great.  Came by to celebrate our friend’s birthday and had a wonderful time.

Thank you Read more Came for brunch before a play.  If you want to eat close to your theater this would be a perfect spot.  The food was all fine, nothing noteworthy.  Calamari was fried nicely but slightly oily.  The quiche was creamy but the only real flavor was the bacon.  Chicken club was a chicken club. Cosmopolitan was nice but a little limey. The mimosa flight was a fun concept and we enjoyed the way it was served and the portion. A nice way to try a few different mimosas.

My favorite lobster roles I have tried!  Made a reservation to have dinner with my brother ahead of our seeing Barry Manilow at Radio City Music Hall. Perfect location for that - midway between Penn Station and Radio City. They couldn't have been more accommodating with my reservation as my train was delayed and I had to change the reservation twice on my way in. They were great--got us seated when we arrived. The service was first-rate and the staff so friendly and human. We shared the crab and lobster bite appetizer and both had the aged cheddar burgers. The burgers and the smokey, tangy barbecue sauce served on the side was amazing. The entrees included truffle fries that were perfect--light and crispy! If I had had more time, I would have done the combo with the lobster roll but will save that for next time. I highly recommend Burger and Lobster and will be back soon! Read more Great experience

The host definitely needs a lesson in manners and customer service, or to stay home when he’s feeling cranky!  Had a long and lingering early dinner here with a friend and the only thing I can complain about is that the tables were too close together (but it's New York) and the noise level was higher than I would have liked. Started with an appetizer of calamari (very crispy and just a tiny bit floury/underfried) and some non alcoholic teas. My friend had the lobster roll and I had the lobster grilled salad. Both were delicious, the salad surprisingly (but not if I'd read the menu carefully) came with fries and they were delicious. The salad was just exceptional, the lobster tender and the vegetables and dressing fabulous. Desert for my friend was the chocolate mousse and it was creamy, airy, and delicious.

Brought my daughter to New York City, and truly had five star experience, not only with the food, but the service, the ambience, and everything in between. Read more Beautiful ambience.  The food was excellent and moderately priced.  We had the chocolate souffle for dessert and it was excellent!!  Very nice place and good food but a lot of room to improve service, long wait times for waiter to come take our order and between courses  Outstanding dining. Beautiful and amazing flavors! Top notch!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  One of my top 5 places to eat in Manhattan because of the ambience.  The food is great too!  But I love eating among all the plants!!!  It is so serene and lovely!!  And not too loud!  Thank you for creating such a LOVELY EXPERIENCE!!! Read more Quick summary: I will definitely go back. Great dinner w/wife and son, and all agree!

Thank you,
Dave Read more The King Crab Tagliatelle, the Broccoli Cacio e Pepe and the Bolognese were delicious.  Ambience is beautiful and the tiramisu is to die for.  Wonderful flavorful meal served by a delightful server.
Highly recommend  My experience overall was really good . I would definitely recommend and come back.  We ate in the garden, tented area. It was really nice. An except from the chaos below. The wait staff were very nice and helpful. The food was wonderful. My husband especially loved the skirt steak.

Everything about this experience was top notch - the ambiance, the live music (the musicians were excellent), the server and the food. I loved the food options and complimentary cocktail. The food was prepared and served with care. My server, Peyton, was personable, professional and attentive. I throughly enjoyed my brunch!  Thank you! Read more Delicious and the ambience perfect. The service was outstanding a great place we will be coming to again. The crab omelette was my favorite!  We enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. The chocolate soufflé was outstanding.  Fantastic! Really really nice ambiance with the garden everywhere! But even better was the food! The maitake mushroom was soooo good. The duck was fabulous! Our server was really on point, delightful and attentive. Read more Excellent service good food and beautiful restaurant  Probably the worst service experience we’ve ever had in decades of dining out. It’s unfortunate because the restaurant is stunning. The food was ok but nothing special for the prices. But we got NO service. After 10 minutes, We had to ask an employee to send a server over. After several more minutes, a server came, didn’t introduce herself or make pleasantries but just asked us what we wanted. We told her we needed to be out by a certain time to catch a show and yet she never again visited our table. After finishing, we had to ask someone else to bring our check so that we could leave. Never once did anyone check on us at the table. The service was horrible. Read more The ambiance was beautiful! I wanted to sit out on the terrace but it was not relaxing due the Times Square noise, so I sat inside and it was so quiet and gorgeous! The ambiance was so lovely. The service was spectacular. I ordered a pasta dish, but was disappointed by how small the dish was. It was the size of a small side salad. It was delicious but lacked the grandeur I was expecting. For the price, I was not pleased by the portion of the meal. The wine was delicious though! I would go back and would still recommend to others.

The view is amazing but the food was horrendous!!! I took a friend who was making a trip to NY for first time and figured this restaurant would be perfect.  We both left there to go to another restaurant to eat after spending $300 on dinner and drinks.  The food looked and tasted as though it was kept under a heat lamp for hours. Our apps were dry, I think only the tempura calamari was fresh. The duck was BURNT!!.. not charred but burnt and dry.. soaked in a sauce to cover the flavor.  The pork chops were underwhelming tasting like something I can make at home.  The drinks were amazing.. but the desserts tasted like plastic especially the pistachio Panna cotta.  I was so disappointed. Read more A birthday experience!  The birthday cake was delicious and singing great!  Otherwise food was very good.  tldr; it's ok for drinks and appetizers, but i'd discourage you from having a full meal there. it's loud and the food underwhelms. though the plants are gorgeous.

i had my birthday dinner here, since my mom was staying in the attached hotel. started with calamari for the table, it was fine-lukewarm but edible. i had the yellowtail tartare-nice texture but didn't taste like much. my partner got the tie dye salad and crescent duck, no raves but no complaints there. 

the real disappointment (...and why i'm writing a too long review, a month later!) was the wagyu. my mother ordered hers medium well, while i requested it to be prepared as rare as possible. both arrived stiff and took so much effort to cut and chew that we had to laugh. as my mom was eating, she bit into a piece of white paper, and freaked out because it looked like toilet paper. it was covered in splotches of yellow, red, and brown. she lost her appetite. our waiter (who was friendly and attentive) said that it was the paper they use to wipe the plates before food is set on it-a mistake. but then someone else came from the kitchen to say the paper was a standard thing that went under the meal. sure enough, my plate had one too, only it was neat and folded and didn't unravel in my food the way my mom's did. they comped it and offered her another meal but she was too grossed out to want anything else. meanwhile, my wagyu was way, way overcooked ...and under-seasoned. but after the ordeal with my mom's meal, i didn't want to complain. 

it was a sad way to spend a milestone birthday. we practically had to yell at each other to make conversation over all of the times square noise and helicopters. they did kindly give us a birthday dessert. the miso spinach and cocktails were the best part, but didn't make up for the overpriced, mediocre, kinda gross meal.

The food is exceptional. Standouts for me include the quail and all of the fish dishes. The Trahana Tots are not to be missed and the dolma is always freshly made and vibrant. The wine list is terrific and my daughter loves the Shirley Temple with house-made grenadine. Such a nice touch.

Shout out to Melanie, our favorite server. She’s attentive, knowledgeable and as sweet as that wonderful grenadine.

The night we were there, the usual entertainer was not there and someone was in his place. He was very good and it was a great show.

Thank you all so much guys - until next time 🥂 Read more The Carnegie Club was an excellent experience and m'lady was most definitely pleased as was the plan. 

Having said that I wasn't too pleased with some of the hidden fees for live music. For instance our reservation fee cost $40 per person, cool, but there's an undisclosed 'music fee' of another $40 per person?! That is unusual. Have you ever been to a concert with tickets paid for-- and pay again after entry once you sit in your seat-- since you'll be listening to live music?

We hadden de eerste show, je verwacht dat de bekende nummers te horen zijn maar je krijgt te horen dat die in de 2e show zitten. En dan baal je een beetje. Voor een flinke toeslag kun je blijven maar dan ben je in totaal $70,- kwijt en dan zou je ook in totaal 4 drankjes moeten nemen. Dat is gemiddeld ook $80,-. En dan loopt het snel op. Dus beter de 2e show boeken. Het zicht is op veel plaatsen slecht. In wezen hoor je de muziek en zit je naar een tv scherm te kijken. Verwacht van zo’n zaak wel een goed zicht. Dus al met al wordt je een beetje voor de gek gek houden en is het meer teleurstelling dan enthousiasme wat je voelt. Read more Read more first class place outstanding really really enjoyed it  I had purchased prime seats for the 8:30 PM Saturday show and dinner. Unfortunately, traffic was horrible, and I arrived 30 minutes late to my reservation. Despite trying to call several times and leaving a message to inform the restaurant that we were running late, our seats were given away by the time we arrived, which was somewhat understandable given our tardiness.

However, the lack of communication and empathy from the host and managers was disappointing. The only response we received was a repeated, curt, ""You can stand at the bar,"" even though the bar was already full. We noticed that the second floor had some available seats and eventually, after some persistence, we were seated there. We did enjoy the great music and found the food to be decent, which somewhat salvaged the evening.

Later, when I inquired with the host about the possibility of finding seats for the 10:30 PM show so we could stay a little longer, the response was a blunt, ""We are fully booked."" There was no attempt to show any compassion or provide an alternative solution that would make us feel valued as customers.

In short, while the ambiance and entertainment were enjoyable, the service was truly lucking. Read more We didn't actually eat here, but open table made it a mandatory field. Great spot and must visit location if you're into cigars, jazz, and good whiskey.  Unlike visits the last couple years, service was always pretty good. This time service was almost non existent, as if our group didn’t exist.  In a couple of occasions, we had to fetch our own water at the bar. We only ordered one drink but could very easily had at least one more per person on our party.   Then it was a challenge to get anyone’s attention to pay the bill.  Carnegie club is a great space and we may come back, but with less enthusiasm than in years past. Read more A faultless night,from the music,to the service and the atmosphere, everything was perfect..  Loved the place we went to the 10:30 show and it was really good but short and after that they didn’t put louder music at all  I went here to celebrate a Bachelor evening with some friends. We went for the Sinatra Saturday and had an absolute blast. Highly recommend for a cigars and Sinatra type evening.  Love the vibe and the music. Don’t mind cigars.

This is a neighbor hood gem.  A memorable dinner.  We love Tasca. The food is consistently outstanding. Lovely staff and ambience.  Fantastic! Will absolutely recommend and will return ❤️  Tasca is ok. It feels like it should be nicer than it is. A meal for 3 is $400+. The food is well prepared and good, but nothing about it is unique or special. There are a ton of great options on the menu. I've been a couple of times. Down stairs can be oppressively loud. The service is spotty because everyone is running up and down stairs, so your server will just disappear at times. The ceiling basically focuses your neighbors conversation at you. It is great for nice bites at the bar and a drink if you are going out, but as a dining experience there are better options on the UWS for the price. Read more Order was wrong multiple times. Under cooked Churassco. Wrong drink order.  Not even an offer to take something off the check after so many problems.

Service was great, food a little pricy for what you get (even for NYC) and while good, not great, though it might just be what we ordered   Have been to several Serafinas in the past, and after reading the mixed reviews for 38th Street, was quite pleasantly surprised. The location was convenient for our business dinner—a party of six. We were seated promptly at a nicely sized round table that was big enough to hold all the dinnerware yet conducive to conversation. For starters, we shared a Margherita pizza, a salad with kale and grapefruit, and the prosciutto with burrata. For mains—chicken parmigiana, cacio e pepe pasta, rigatoni bolognese, and salmon—all equally delicious. There wasn’t one dish that was sub par. Pre-dinner cocktails were crowd pleasers, as were the two bottles of the Phelps Napa cab.  Dessert consisted of the chocolate mousse, pistachio tart, and tiramisu—all perfectly tasting yet did not feel heavy. The meal was a huge success—will definitely be back here!

Thanks!!!  Good was very good but it was the service that stood out.
Nice evening !  Food is good, though staff are not that friendly.  Love the food, service was not friendly and we  waited over an hour for entrees.  When it first opened this location of the chain was unique and different. Of late, the service is mediocre and TBH I feel that the food has slightly gone from great to just okay.

For a restaurant that’s been open for 2 months, I expected the service to be on point! Lacked a bit of organization. Dirty plates were left at the table for far too long. Waitress Marcella was very polite and nice. The real issue was the food, lacking flavor and seasons. And just subpar of what’s expected from a chef Mina restaurant.

We were eager to try this new NYC home of the Michael Mina group located in the beautiful, iconic Essex House on Central Park South. What a great location - very easy to see The Park, Lincoln Square, shops at Columbus Circle and then have a world-class dinner before a nice walk down to theater past all the high end shopping on 5th, or jumping on subway right down block for a few stops to the rest of your evening.
Bar was bustling with great low tables and seating to gather and some excellent cocktails, including a great Old Fashioned, and perfect Martinis and Cosmos. Wine list was extensive. The dining room steps down the noise a bit and is filled with helpful but unobtrusive servers. Devin the maitre d' / Manager, and his team were gracious, knowledgeable, and professional.
The menu is a fresh update on classic steakhouse with something for everyone in our group ranging in age from 15-81. Everything we had was great from raw bar to apps to entrees and accompaniments. Don’t miss the Alaskan king crab rolling cart, or the raw bar with little neck clams and oysters on the half shell. We saw the seafood tower and it looked amazing. Apps included the bacon-wrapped scallops - wow, and the cherry tomato tart. Next time we also want to do the caviar service which is supposed to be great.
Entrees were exceptional.The ribeye was perfect, the phyllo crusted dover sole was great, the lamb chops were awesome, the half lobster was also perfection. Accompaniments included the spinach soufflé and black truffle Mac and cheese which isn’t presented thrown in a bowl as you think. We also had amazing jalapeño (I think) snap peas which aren’t on the online menu to look back on, but that’s a good sign they will be dynamic and seasonal for future visits.

Our waitress Daniela was very helpful and attentive.  Great energy and the staff was so nice, will be coming back!  I literally didn’t get my food after waiting 45 minutes so I just left  Best experience the new food menu is amazing and drinks unbelievable, the cocktail la moza in Cartagena is the perfect balance between sweet and fresh!  Phenomenal, from the start till the end. Every moment was unforgettable.  So wonderful! I will be coming back for sure very soon  Such a great experience!!! The food and the staff were the best part! 10/10  Blue Mezze is my favorite spot in the Upper East. Had a great experience as always!  Pros: Good service, for the most part; excellent, authentic Mediterranean menu. Cons: Host couldn’t find my reservation (I had to show him on OpenTable’s app); food arrived in a bit of a discombobulated manner,  in that an appetizer was missing & a main course order arrived almost 1/2 hour after the others; tables are too close together, making it almost impossible to navigate the space; noise level was deafening, to the point that it was hard to hear conversations.

Je recommande.  Although the front of the restaurant is vibrant and inviting there is a back room which felt like being relegated to the kids table at a family holiday dinner.

The food was fine, but nothing particularly interesting.  The bronzino was slightly overcooked.   They forgot to make the dessert, which they said was on the menu, until I reminded them.  Then they put a candle in the chocolate dessert as promised.  Several of our guests had multiple cocktails and wine, so I know that accounts for some of the price of the bill.

Excited that Mission Ceviche opened a location in Union Square so my friend and I made a table reservation to check it out but the vibe at the bar was great so decided to eat there instead. The bartender, Richard, was funny, knowledgeable (gave great recommendations) and talented (made a mean a Pisco Sour). The food was delicious and the ambience was wonderful; beautiful decor, large bar and welcoming staff. The energy was lively but still at a level where you can actually speak and be heard.

We had previously visited and loved the UES location. The service was slow and somehow both inattentive and obtrusive, the rolls were honestly disgusting, and the music so loud it was difficult to hear each other.

One member of our party had a shellfish allergy, so we asked our server if one of the sauces included shellfish. She said yes, then no. When my wife suggested she check with the kitchen, since it’s an allergy, she got offended and said she knew what was in the sauce and there was no shellfish, so we should just order it. 5 minutes later, a manager comes out to tell us the sauce does include shellfish. When I suggest that the waitstaff be better trained on this, given the potential risks involved, he gave some rambling story about how the sauce made in Peru.

I was hoping for a memorable experience, given my excellent past visit to Dani Brasserie at the Four Seasons in Madrid.

Unfortunately, the dinner was a complete fiasco. The pork rib paella arrived in an unacceptable state—burnt in places, undercooked in others, and lacking any real flavor. The first red flag came with the ham croquettes, which were served cold. To make matters worse, they tried to take away our tapas three times before we were finished, and there was no host to greet us upon arrival, adding to the disorganization. The service was not only slow but also clumsy and unprofessional.

This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to leave a negative review on OpenTable. What should have been an unforgettable evening was completely ruined, becoming a frustrating waste of time. Deeply disappointing for a restaurant of this stature. Read more Warm service and excellent tapas-style food.  Very interesting drinks  Casa Dani is our favorite restaurant in NYC and we’ve been there many times. This time I have to say we’ve been a bit disappointed. First the menu had had some changes: our favorite dish (pan con tomate with tuna belly) was not anymore on the menu, the tortilla is not the one it used to be, the jamon tray is now iberico and not bellota, the croquetas were quite disappointing.
And finally the dessert (rice pudding) has changed too: the delicious crust has disappeared and on top of that the waiter wasn’t able to finish the dish with the raspberrys and we ate it incomplete.
The sangria (74$ for a jug!) we ordered immediately was served very late during the meal and only because we asked few times.
We’ll be back maybe but unfortunately this time the experience was not good Read more Ordered 8 tapas for 3 people to share and it was perfect. Tasted great  Non existent service waited over an hour for a drink. Service acted like we didn’t exist  Having read some reviews commenting on inconsistent service, we were needlessly worried, as the service staff has clearly responded to the feedback by extra attentiveness to our requests. They well advised us on portion sizes, which avoided a potential overordering situation, as one Paella was really appropriate, given the well advised selection of excellent Tapas. Read more While the food was quite good, the service was absolutely horrible. After arriving I placed a drink order and not soon after we ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. First my drink never came and the waitress came back after food had been delivered to ask me if I wanted to order a drink… I had already given her a drink order that some how slipped her mind completely. Then as the food came out one item never came and one item was incorrect. The waitress then went on to argue with my sister and I that she had written down the right item and that we were incorrect about what we ordered. She also did not write down the croquetas that we ordered and so we never got them. The final straw was after I placed my card down for the check, another staff member came to get it and did charge my card as I could see him do so, but then brings me back the receipt without the merchant or customer copies for me to sign and when I waived down my waitress she goes on to say I have to give her my card first. I told her another staff member took it in her place and brought back without the receipts. She then chased around for the guy who did it and realized I did in fact pay but was right in that he never gave me the receipt to sign. All in all this was the worst service I’ve experienced in a long time. While the food was great, the service makes me never want to return. Read more Great food, front end service was very poor, the meat platter was a mistake  Over priced and food terrible service was very sllow  The restaurant has a lovely look, the color palette is very soothing, one feels  at ease, chill, very laid back. Upon entering, I was greeted by the host and seated immediately, even though I was the first to arrive in my party. We were 5 and tried the tasting menu without the wine pairing. As far as the food; starting with the crudo, this was by far the best part of our meal, the croquettes and ceasar salad were algo very good. We  tried two paellas, mariscos and short rib. The mariscos paella was very salty and I believe it was overcooked, not in the way that paella is supposed to be, crunchy rice, etc. , but the seafood itself was put in to fast thus making the seafood dry and tough. The second paella was better rice was crunchy, a little burnt, but I like this, and the ribs were tender, although way to much seasoning, which took away from the taste of the meat. We also had two desserts, the pineapple and the rice pudding, the pineapple was ok, the rice pudding was not great, it was too runny, long grain rice was used, not valencia rice, and it was not even sweet. Overall, I was expecting an amazing gastronomic experience but at best it was ok. Would go back just for the crudo and croquettes. Read more Read more Everything was fabulous. Only thing I would've liked is for a little something since I made a note stating it was our 10th wedding anniversary. Not a song and dance but maybe a small dessert would've been nice since we could've gone anywhere but chose this restaurant. Read more Our expecting Paella was unfortunately not hot enough and lacking of a good balance between cost and quality. The plates and glasses were beautiful and the interior was fantastic.  Beautiful place in a nice location, food is fine (paellas probably the best they have in the menu. Wine selection is a little bit short in comparison with such an elegant location. I’d recommend the experience though. Read more It’s always a great place to be special if you’re at the bar service fantastic  The entire staff went beyond to take care of our large party. What a treat. Highly recommended.  We ordered the tasting menu. The first dish was tuna and guacamole.  It did not seem Spanish-inspired. The metal stand it was served on was perhaps 12"" high- like the stand one would use for a seafood  e.g. oysters plate.  Much too high. The paella was cold, much too large a portion, and no soccrat. The dessert of pineapple and some kind of sauce tasted great but should have been in another type of dish. It was too deep. The lighting at night could be a little lower. Read more Second time dining here and regrettably, not as good as the first time. The food was good, but the service was way off mark. Our waiter kept pushing us to order entrees in a manner only seen at a fast food joint.  What’s happened here?!  I’d like to also add that the wine list is now a minuscule version of the original.  Apparently the restaurant has changed ownership. I hope the new ownership takes stock of this place and reinvigorates it. Read more Very nice place. The food wasn’t extremely exciting but it was delicious.
Service is fantastic.  Horrible service and the rice was not cooked- when we mentioned this we were told our rice is crunchy—  Service was not particularly welcoming at all, each time our server arrived at the table, he stared before saying anything. We also got sat in the far back corner when nearly everybody else was sat in the main dining room for some reason while there were many unseated tables on this regular Wednesday evening. Food was definitely good but nothing extraordinary especially for the price but I suppose that can be accounted for in the curation of quality ingredients. The highlight of this restaurant is its interior architecture (save the oddly paired music); if only we were sat somewhere where we could better take in the architecture. Read more Read more We have been at Casa Dani countless times, and always was a great experience, unfortunately looks like this is going to be a “used to” place.
Croquetas used to be the best in NY, now are meh at best
Pan con tomate and tuna belly used to be one of the best appetizers, now they are little sponges soaked on tomato liquid that kills the tuna flavor.
They used to have a great wine list that no only is now limited to 3-4 options (they have more french selections than Spanish, hello? Is this a Spanish restaurant?) but also way overprice ($100 for a $20 bottle)
The service used to be great, yesterday it was the worst service we have had ever, and oh! When they bring the check the bring it with 20,22 and 25%
in all fairness the paellas are still great and the oxtail brioche always on point, but unfortunately looks like they just gave up and are only interested in one time tourist guests.
😞 Read more Our server was great, the sommelier made a wonderful recommendation on a bottle of wine... When we ordered a second bottle, he came by the table and removed the bottle and decanter (which still had some wine in it) and whisked it away before we could say anything and brought the decanter back full with the new empty wine bottle. I quietly mentioned to  the sommelier that it was very unusual to remove the decanter with wine still in it and to not let us taste the new wine before decanting it etc and it was met with a dismissive attitude. For all I know the wine could have been swapped for a cheaper bottle and decanted with the original wine bottle brought back. I tasted it and don't think that was the case. I've never experienced that from a restaurant let alone a knowledgeable sommelier before. The fact that an apology wasn't given was disappointing.

The food was fine but didn't blow us away given the mostly positive reviews we had read. The seafood paella wasn't good so we didn't eat it and our wonderful server took it off the bill and brought out some complimentary desserts which was appreciated.

Though the food is terrible, the service is an insult.  Great service and excellent tapas, amazing space as well  Food was good, although very overpriced for what it was.  Service was terrible. The servers were all nice and competent, but there were not enough of them, and there didn't seem to be a single server assigned to our table.

I had a great time celebrating my friend's birthday at Chazz Palminteri restaurant. She requested Italian and we were greeted with such warmth as Besnik was attentive and accommodating.

The ambience was divine and it was quiet where we had amazing conversation. My friend had the Ceasar Salad as well and Pollo Parmigiana with a Brazilian Cosmopolitan.

I gave a slightly lower rating on value because it’s irritating to me to see meatless pasta dishes priced at $30.

The waiter was very hard to hear (not because the restaurant was loud).  Throughout the evening the wait staff repeatedly delivered the wrong food to the wrong person at the table.  Next, and the real issue i had was in wine selection; we selected a middle of the road wine (mid 200's per bottle); the waiter, in front of the group (not off tot he side) said he recommended a different wine that was 'about the same price, a little more expensive); which i approved.  Upon getting the bill, the price per bottle was just under 400 per.  At one point in the dinner the wait staff began pulling the appetizers that still were being consumed and proceeded to 'dole' them out..  was weird.   The waiter was also difficult to understand at times..  there was a definite vibe that the waiter was trying to get us to buy more than we needed in addition to the wine issue.  The group felt the food was good but not in alignment with the prices...  one guest commented that the cheese cake was just okay; i had the lava cake and there wasn't much 'lava' to it.. almost dry..

The rooftop feel was more patio outdoor seating and there is currently construction occurring so the scaffolding is still up and blocks portions of the views.

We also ordered beef stroganoff, which was just ok. The kids had chocolate chip pancakes and the bread basket. Good experience overall. Read more Wonderful experience! A one of a kind menu and first class service.  Had a very strange experience with the waitstaff. The host came around one time to check on us and the only things he made a point to do were attempt to teach me the ""proper"" way to eat the meal in front of me and rearrange my plates to his liking. He also made a comment about me ""learning what caviar is"" as to insinuate I've never had it or I need to be schooled in fine dining. It felt very pointed and targeted, as I was the only Black diner in the restaurant. He also did not make these comments to my white partner, only directly to me. It was very disappointing and made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed. It was an insult to my intelligence. After this weird interaction, he didn't come back to ask how I was doing, in fact, no one did, not even my server. It is very obvious they felt speaking to us or giving us special attention would've been time wasted. It was meant to be an anniversary dinner and instead ended up being one of the weirdest and most micro-aggressive dining experiences of my entire life. Outside of the service, the dushbara was so flavorless, the broth was essentially water. The borscht was delicious, as was the sea bass and beef wellington. I wanted to leave, so I asked for the check without tea or dessert. It's a shame that was experience was colored by the strange and wrong assumptions of a pompous host. Read more Had great service- very attentive. Plus there is an extensive wine list.  A true New York experience that we will remember a long time.

First time to the Russian Tea Room! Great food and service!  Colossal waste of money!!!  If you want to spend $400 (for 2 people) to sit in a pretty room then this is for you. The afternoon tea was boring sandwiches on stale bread. The scones were good but served with frozen butter and store bought jam (no clotted cream). The pastries were 2 stale mini cupcakes (vanilla/chocolate and red velvet), a chewy (I think frozen) macaron and a mini crème brûlée. The waitress took my spoon after the first course so I had nothing to stir my tea or eat the creme brulée with but a fork. Honestly we had to laugh it was so ridiculous.

I had the caviar omelet which is really a spinach omelet with a little caviar & sour cream on top. Quite tasty but a bit misleading. My wife had the truffle quiche.

We went to celebrate our friends engagement, staff made it a night to remember.  Great atmosphere, fantastic service. Good food and perfectly cooked.  I love a great New York steak house and this was my first visit to the Empire Steak House East - and it sure won't be my last. Firstly the wonderful staff welcomes you from the moment you walk in the door. Everyone was so polite and friendly and really wanted you to have a great experience. The restaurant is very unique and unusual as it is an old dinner theater. It is a large room with a high ceiling. The wall of wine racks are where the stage used to be. It has a massive chandelier in the center and we sat at a large banquette table along the side. We were visited by several waitstaff and the manager stopped at our table after every stage of the meal to be sure we were happy with the service. The food was outstanding. Great craft cocktails, Caesar salad and lump crabmeat cocktail with large lumps of crabmeat. Delicious. And we had filet mignons that were cooked exactly as we requested and were tender and delicious. The sides of home fries sautéed asparagus and creamed spinach were excellent. And freshly made tiramisu for dessert. This was a great meal and the best service I've had in a long time. We can give them - all of them - our highest recommendation.

I came for the restaurant week menu and found that to be a great deal! I was impressed with the vibe of the restaurant and the atmosphere. When I walked in, the two bartenders looked at me and ignored me. I tried to find the host stand and no one was there. Finally got the manager to greet me and seat me at the bar. The two bartenders were not friendly at first. It felt like they were just going through the motions of being there. I finally got one of them to talk and she seemed quite friendly and I wanted to know more about her. The food came out reasonably timed, but the steak was overcooked. It was a solid medium when I ordered medium rare. The portion was great for the restaurant week price, I was not about to send it back. They ran out of the after dinner drink I ordered while they were pouring mine, they were kind enough to give me the beverage that was available but they didn’t have a back up bottle to finish the pour.

The food is always excellent (their Bolognese is the best!). The ambience — like sitting in a wine cellar in Italy — enhances the experience. The wait staff is attentive but unobtrusive.

Food was well seasoned and tasty.  The food was fantastic. The drinks (cocktails) were horrible. The service was absolutely terrible. They were nice but not responsive or attentive.  The food was very good, but the service was terrible.  First it took our waiter about 15-20 minutes to bring our drink order.  Then, another person brought out our entrees before the appetizer.  It was very disorganized considering how empty it was, but the one factor that was positive was the freshness and quality of the food.  The spaghetti bolognese and chicken parmigiana were both very good. Read more The food that we ended up getting was good, but the service was poor. The guys doing bread, water, clearing, were great, but the actual waitress was rather clueless - never asked about more drinks, tried to offer us dessert when we’d only had our salad, had to ask us to repeat what we ordered several times after only getting salad, some of which we still never got. The chickpea salad and rigatoni were excellent, so it was a shame the rest of the experience was not great. Read more Delightful little restaurant.

We were told although we had a reservation we would have to sit at the bar or by the stk sign but there is no food service so we would be on our own.

The food was so flavorful and delicious, with a pleasant mouth burn but not too hot! In particular, the Taiwanese pork chop, mushroom dandan and mango salad were delicious.

The food was Delicious and received great customer  service .  Food was over sauced. Service was lackluster. Would not recommend.  The food was delicious with healthy portions and the staff is amazing!   We had a reservation for 9:00 and the restaurant closes at 10. I assumed if they accept reservations for 9, we would be able to enjoy our meal. Unfortunately, we were extremely rushed. First, at around 9:30 our server said she was leaving and that someone else would take over. That’s fine, but is really not the most professional way to run service. About 5 minutes later (less than 10 minutes after our entrees arrived and we were eating at a steady pace), the new server asked if we wanted a box to go. We were clearly still eating. Again, no big deal, but it was apparent they wanted us out. The menu said rice was included and none came out (who eats curry without rice?!) so I asked for some. We were charged for it. I didn’t mention it, because I’m sure it was only a few bucks, but it added to the lackluster service. As we were eating our entrees, the waiter said he would bring our desserts right away- we had to order them when we ordered the rest of the meal. We ordered a s’mores dessert (no problem when ordering), and when it was time for it to come out, the server said they couldn’t do it. He offered a slice of pie instead. I assume it was quicker to prepare and/or eat. We were out of the restaurant by 10:05. The food and cocktails were pretty good, but the service was the worst I’ve had in many years. It’s probably not even the servers fault, they were friendly enough, but it likely comes from management. Read more Food was spectacular.

Excellent and friendly service. Well worth the money.  The servers were extremely helpful and friendly. Great food suggestions. the food was amazing but may be spicy for some people.

Inside is a buzzing and hip restaurant and bar. The quirky interior design is inviting and inventive. Diners are encouraged to explore the different rooms and to have fun. 

The menu is a bit limited and leans toward comfort over health. However, everything that came to table was well-made and delicious.

My experience was not the best (gave 2 stars) partially because I am lacto ovo vegetarian and they “ran out of the ingredient” for Moussaka entree for 6pm dinner reservation. I was offered alternative vegetarian entree which was not of my liking.

Since dinner entree options were absolutely limited for me, I requested to create a veggie entree made of sides options - lemon potatoes/grilled veggies/lentils that cost me about $30 as a full entree, more than the original request of Moussaka.

The disappointment was the bill - ridiculous price I have ever paid for creating an entree of side dishes!! They could have taken the initiative to accommodate or offer to adjust the pricing (without my asking) instead of charging me more than the cost of original entree request only because there was lacking on their behalf! Read more Disappointing Diversion

While the staff's efforts to accommodate us during their gas outage were appreciated, the overall experience was underwhelming. The sister restaurant's limited menu and wine selection were disappointing, especially considering the initial promise of a similar offering.

Since we chose the restaurant week lunch menu and have 4 people, it would cost $180. Even with tax, it will be less than $200. But I was charged $217 or something. Then I asked the manager how they ended up with $217, he printed out another receipt with details listing the original price, tax, gratitude, etc. Once I noticed they already charged us gratitude, I asked him to cross out the tip I intended to pay and asked why he didn’t give me this detailed version receipt while I was paying, he said there’s on on your table, but there’s nothing on my table!!! Even if they will give me one copy before we leave, you are supposed to make it clear on your receipt that the gratitude is already included instead of fooling customers like this!!!!! I am still kinda worried that I will still be charged the tip amount even if he has crossed it out. I will never go back!!! Definitely not recommend this to anyone!!!!!

Looking forward to going back.  Wonderful tonnarelli cacio pepe, as hoped. Great bartender makes bar seating a preferred option, however the large TV screen is a bit assertive and out of place.  I always enjoy dining at Cacio e Pepe Uptown.  Salvatore is a master of blending flavors that are unique and wonderful.  Tonight I had the ricotta ravioli which sounds commonplace.  But the rabbit ragu and roasted mortadella made it very special - it was wonderful.  I tasted the seafood risotto that was very creamy and filled with seafood that was cooked just right.  I usually have the Insalata  10, 20, 30 which is always fresh and delicious and a great way to start a meal.  For dessert, we shared the tiramisù which is like no other tiramisù I've ever tasted.  There is an Amaretto ""tiramisù"", seems like an Amaretto pudding, with apricot sauce on the side, and a cup of espresso granita which was fabulous and a great addition to the rest of the dessert.

On our visit , the wait staff was really worked hard so wait times were a bit long. They offered us a complimentary beverage. Each server who waited on us, however, was friendly and helpful.

It was a comfortable environment and a welcome rest from a busy NYC say. We would definitely stop there again. Read more Host and servers were friendly and accommodating. Menu is rather limited.

The food was simply incredible.  Was next to our hotel. Enjoyed the Alderman for happy hour, dinner and breakfast. Nice quiet spot in bust Times Square.  We had no idea this restaurant was tucked in the back of our hotel. I came with my mom and we chose the pre-theatre menu. Everything was amazing from the start. The server was so cool and knew about all the dishes. The Parker house rolls were so amazing, especially with the roasted garlic. The salad portions were huge and so expertly seasoned that I didn’t want mine to end. I had the Apple and endive salad which is now one of my favorite salads I’ve ever had. We were getting full by the time our entrees came out but the butternut squash lasagna was awesome and had this great, lemony arugula salad on top to lighten it up. To finish, the hazelnut ice cream was perfect. Honestly one of the best meals I have had in a while! Read more I booked dinner here with two friends.  A measure of the quality of a restaurant is the people who work there.  Just after we finished dinner my friend suddenly lost consciousness and had a medical emergency.  The staff immediately helped out, called 911 and monitored the situation until we left by ambulance.  Most importantly they kept me calm!  Thank you to the entire staff! Read more I had the pre-fix theatre menu and it was delicious. The service was wonderful, and it was a nice atmosphere. It was not noisy so I could have great conversation.  I definitely would eat here again.  Somewhat overpriced but quite good food in a Hotel restaurant.  My major issue is that they provided the main entree course with no sides. Literally, a burger which costs $18 arrived with no fries or salad. I realized at the end that the sides were extra so fries cost $12 which means you have a $30 burger.  The service was pretty attentive and friendly but the waitress was really keen to remove out plates (which still had food on and we were eating!).  I probably wouldn't return specifically to the location for food which is a shame as the food was really good! No need to skimp out on the sides-come on! Read more It was amazing.

We went during happy hour- doz oysters we great, was also had the Italian pickles with Parker rolls- very good as well. My husband had the duck- it was very tender, and I had the horseradish crusted salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. Compliments were given to the chef!

The cost was $45/ person and since we went for 6pm, it was also happy hour for drinks. The restaurant manager made sure to speak with each table on several occasions throughout the meal to ensure everyone was satisfied. Love the personal attention given to each table and the awesome wait staff. The chorizo croquettes, endive salad and horseradish crusted salmon were some table favorites. The warm rolls with house made garlic butter that was given before the appetizer tasted amazing too. My family was able to eat, relax and make it out of the restaurant in 90 minutes.

It has a lux vibe (dark but soft and comforting) and the staff were very friendly and attentive. I went before a Wednesday evening show and was surprised to find it not packed. The menu had a lot of small dishes that I wanted to try (typical girl dinner) and all were delicious. The pickle plate had veggies that I never even thought of pickling (squash? fiddlehead ferns???) and was very good but I could only eat half for fear that any more vinegar would wipe out my palette (it was veryyyy pickled). The shaved ham was exactly what it sounds like and was nice and sugary sweet. The crispy mushrooms were nice and thin and the batter very flavorful. By the time I got to my entree — the pea agnolotti — I could hardly eat anymore, but the pea filling was so refreshing that I managed to eat half (against my better judgment)! Accompanying my meal, I had the watermelon daisy which tasted just like watermelon juice and I could even taste the alcohol — which is exactly what I’m looking for in a beverage! I will definitely return the next time I’m in town! Read more elegant restaurant, with a good variety of food.

The staff was attentive to a fault and either very new or not trained well for the dining experience. They hovered around diners and constantly tried to clear our table well before we were ready,. Everything felt rushed despite the restaurant being half empty while we were there. We finally tired of being asked if we were done with our appetizers and let them take everything away before we were finished eating. At one point a staff member took away my half-finished cocktail. 

The food was, overall, fine. But the restaurant itself really feels like the rest of this part of Manhattan: bland and uninteresting. 

If you’re going to visit a Samuelsson restaurant in NYC, go to Red Rooster. Read more Read more The service and experience upon entry was amazing. The food was delicious, ambience was elegant and the staff was very helpful. My only complaint would be for the website to give some information on how to get to the restaurant. The restaurant is on Fulton Street where it’s blocked to vehicles as it’s next to the World Trade Center, guest should know in advance the easiest way to arrive i.e. nearest streets and parking garages etc. Read more Started with the friendly Hostess wishing us Birthday wishes to the very nice Bartender serving us & telling us we cn take drinks to table & it wld be put on our bill. The food was excellent from the corn bread to snapper perfect. There was a plant behind my husband that was on his head. The Hostess came by us & cut it. The space is big an airy. We can’t wait to go back. Read more Good food and server was very good I will for sure go back  The food and drinks were absolutely delicious, and our waiter was very down to earth and attentive.  Always delicious! Great for brunch or dinner. Wonderful service and gorgeous space.  The food was excellent as usual but I was surprised and a bit disappointed that there were no desserts available other than affogato and only cafe Americano  What a beautiful and quiet place, I loved it💗I will return.  Great space but the food was almost comically bad for astronomical prices.  Ran into some issues with items that were on the menu, that we ordered, and only after they never showed up were wee told that they had been removed from the item a month ago (succotash).  Also ordered the soufflé and had to ask about the amount of time it would take.  We had the extra 20 minutes so waited for it to arrive -- and then were told that the chef didn't like the looks of it so decided to throw it out and not replace it with anything, tho they did comp our other desert....not great work by the staff here. Read more I have gone twice for dinner within 2 weeks - loved it.  Read more Great experience and most convenient to the theater !  This restaurant looked awesome but for the price the quality and amount of food is pretty “not good”.

1. Squash crab blossom: 1 little Squash blossom on served in a cloth napkin with soup next to it. When we ordered to share for two they did not mention it was not big enough to share.
2. Short ribs - Looked like a “single beef jerky on a  metal stick covered in green sauce. I said “if this is the meal we’ll have to go get pizza after this”. Did not come with any sides and had to add potato’s for an extra 12 dollars. Making this meal 64 dollars and I was still ready to get pizza afterwards.
3. Crispy snapper - This is not crispy as in pan fried super crispy both sides of the skin. It’s actually tempura fried and lacked flavor. Kinda boring flavors.
4. Meal took 2hrs and the restaurant wasn’t even full
5. I put it was a birthday on the open table and no one said a word about it.

All in all this was hyped because of the cool brand new building it was in. Probably would not go back after spending 150+ on just food and it wasn’t anything I want to eat again at all. Read more Although I grew up eating food like this, the fried chicken & greens are way better than I remember. Simply the best summer (tomatoes & watermelon) salad!  McKayla our waitress was so kind with suggestions and so helpful.  Wonderful atmosphere and great food! We really enjoyed it!  delicious. Inspired.  Wonderful experience !
Perfect pre theater  Jessica was amazing!  I will be returning very soon!  Lovely restaurant Great service. Great food  very convenient to PAC theatre  Don’t waste your time nothing great on brunch menu regular burger nothing special the brioche was like a stale cinnamon bun only with a little piece of of ham and when i say little less then half an ounce we were disappointed Read more My husband I celebrated our anniversary at Metropolis and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The space is stylish and romantic; there’s a buzz but we were actually able to have a conversation. The service was impeccable and every recommendation was on point. It’s clear that much thought went into the well edited menu. The snapper tartare, crab squash blossom, and steak was outstanding! Marcus Samuelsson never disappoints.
