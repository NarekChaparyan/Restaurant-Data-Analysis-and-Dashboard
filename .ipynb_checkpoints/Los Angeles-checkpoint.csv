Very nice experience. My partner and friends really enjoy dinner.  It‚Äôs ok ‚Ä¶.parking is horrendous at night and I don‚Äôt like valet services for my cars (personal preference).  Great atmosphere, food, Dj, and the service were great!  This place was sooo good! Our waiter was Christopher and he gave us the best recommendations off the menu. All of the food was amazing and the service was very quick. Beautiful ambiance. The DJ was a major plus! We were dancing in our seats the whole time. This is definitely a well run business. Highly recommend! Read more EVERYTHING was A M A Z I N G. Just absolutely A M A Z I N G!!! üôåüèºüëèüèºüíØ  It was nice. The aquarium was smaller than i expected but our server was great. Good music  Great food- the service was only so-so tonight. The server had told us that there were a lot of issues with the system that night and I could tell they were really exhausted. Server was very friendly- would have been 4 stars, but our drinks and appetizer came out after we had finished all of our other food. Read more The ambience was great!  The food was ok I had better fresh sushi other places.  We had a reservation for 9:15pm and we got seated till 9:45pm. Food was ok.  Read more Overall had a nice dinner experience at Mrs. Fish. Our waiter was fantastic, the aesthetic was amazing, the crowd was eclectic, and the food and cocktails were delicious. The only issue holding me back from giving a 5-star rating is we had to wait more than 1/2 hour to be seated at our reserved table. The wait was made a bit less annoying by complimentary saki and edamame, but still - 1/2 hour+ - really? Also, the DJ music could come down a notch to make it easier to hold a dinner conversation.

I do still recommend Mrs. Fish! Read more Very cool vibe and great service. More of a night club vibe. Food was good but under seasoned .  We found the atmosphere beautiful and lively with a DJ playing fun 80's music. Our food was delicious. But the service was terrible, we had to hail down servers all night  to order and find out where our food was and ask for things we needed. No one came to check up on us or refill our water bottle. Drinks took a long rime to get and 1 was wrong. There are lots of choices for delicious sushi in LA. Not going back, Read more We had a wonderful time, the atmosphere is beautiful.  It's colorful and the art is very interesting. Our waiter was very attentive, as well as the staff.  The food was delicious.  We went with many of our waiters recommendations.  Our cocktails were refreshing and fun.
Love that they have 3 bars and the huge aquarium along the ceiling is beautiful.
Will definitely go again and recommend this restaurant to others! Read more It was a great experience. Good ambiance and scenery. üòä food was good too.  I love everything about this restaurant! The ambiance, the service, the prices and the scenery! I came here with my Bestie to celebrate my birthday and we had the best night. I still can't get over how beautiful this place is, and did I mention they have like 3 bars?! It was a Friday night so they had a DJ playing music and honestly it was just a vibe. I can't wait to come back. Our server was Brian/Bryan he was amazing! So kind, sweet and just great energy. Thank you for taking care of us. We can't wait to come back. Read more Pretty good overall experience, had reservations at 9:30 and waited around 20 minutes to get seated, food and drinks were good overall. Would go again  They were backed up with reservations when we arrived so we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. We ordered drinks at the bar but never got them until we were seated, ordered our food and had to ask the waiter about them. The drinks were completely watered down. The service was not good, the crispy rice was overcooked (almost burnt) but the vibe and other food was good. Read more Beautiful place, good ambiance, good food, good music!  If you're going for the food, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. The sushi selection is quite limited, and while the wine selection is decent, The whisky selection is great. The atmosphere is loud, more like a night club than a restaurant, which makes it hard to enjoy the meal. The place seems to have an identity crisis: is it a sushi restaurant, a whisky bar, or a nightclub? Also, the fish tank is much smaller than expected, so don‚Äôt come here just for that. Overall, if you‚Äôre in the mood for good sushi, I‚Äôd look elsewhere. Read more Read more Overall,  a great experience! We stopped here before a show at Disney Concert Hall. Location was a quick walk and ride down hill using Angels flight.  Great food and dining experience! Live music was an added bonus.  Everything was great except for the service we got from the staff. Our waitress only did 1 check back to see how we were doing. I said great but we needed more water (party of 5) and she never came back with it. I had to flag down another person to get a bottle for the table. It's annoying, if I'm paying that much money, I shouldn't have to do any work like flagging down water for my family. I still left a 20% tip which ended up being $55 to my servers pockets but still, left a negative imprint on my memory. I wouldn't come back BUT I still appreciated the food quality Read more Fist time experience. Though I was a bit late, I was still seated upon arrival. The wait-staff was very attentive and professional. The food was very delicious with great presentation. The prices were upscale. I appreciate that they have a live DJ, being a musician myself, but the volume was a bit loud competing with the volume of the occupancy noise level. The vibe is good food, good service, beautiful people and hyped music.
I‚Äôll be back! Read more Love everything about this place! Food and atmosphere can‚Äôt be beat  I really enjoyed the food and vibe. Loved seeing the different art styles on the walls as well. Will definitely be coming back.  Went to Mrs. Fish last night to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday and we had a time, you hear me! :) From the doorman to the bartender to our waiter, the food, drinks and service were excellent.  The restaurant has great ambiance and just the right amount of chicness for the evening crowd in romantic DTLA on a Friday night. Read more We were sat in a high table with horrible service.

Was not disappointed. A little too dark to see the menus at night but the ambiance is perfect. food is delicious- order a bunch to share! Great servers  Great food as always, and very friendly server.  However, we had to ask more than once for the wine, and one of our dishes never arrived.  I had a great experience here for their happy hour. The outdoor courtyard was beautiful and wasn‚Äôt too buggy. I enjoyed my drink, the chicken sliders, and the pesto caprese salad.  I always love this place. The vibes, food and service are always superb. There‚Äôs something enchanting about this location. I hope it never loses its touch.  I came here last Sunday with my out of town friend that I haven‚Äôt seen in 32 years.
This is my third time and  I love the Silverlake location with its outdoor patio, trees and ambiance. The outdoor garden is beautiful and you feel like you‚Äôre in a treehouse. The venue is beautiful and offered a visually appealing environment with a great playlist of music in the background.
I want to give a big ‚ÄúSHOUT OUT‚Äù to Alexis and Kyle.
We had a mishap with the valet service when we arrived but both Alexis and Kyle (managers) stepped up and resolved the issue immediately. Alexis by phone and Kyle in person.
Kyle was very friendly, helpful and constantly checked on us to make sure we were taken care of.
He went above and beyond the call of duty!
It‚Äôs so refreshing to go to a restaurant and have excellent service!
The food was delicious and prompt.
We ordered burrata caprese, lamb hummus, noa‚Äôs cauliflower, asian pear & brie pizza and grilled pita.
Everything just flowed‚Ä¶.and I want to give credit to our lovely server, Liv.

We were early to brunch (didn't realize they OPENED at 1030am) and the staff was so nice about it. They went ahead and checked in our reservation anyways, so we didn't have to wait in line with everyone else.

I SO appreciate the portions here and the respective pricing as well. There's not so much food that you're uncomfortable, nor is there too little that you're left wanting more. We felt super satisfied and everything was yummy!

Our waiter was great -- didn't come around too much but was always right there when we needed him. Gave great suggestions as well.

All of the staff were so so lovely - the hostess who sat us, the servers, busser‚Ä¶. So friendly and attentive and efficient. I do a lot of fine dining and this service was up there. Not intrusive, checking in periodically - we felt attended to. And not rushed like a lot of places where they‚Äôre trying to turn the table.

We each had a cocktail and a glass of wine.  Good selection of cocktails on the menu. Excellent wine list with lots available by the glass.

Food was nice. Louie salad, prawn skewers, filet, asparagus, mashed potatoes. Steak a perfect med rare. Couple sauces - bearnaise and (a mild) blue cheese that were SO GOOD. Put them on the asparagus. Steak didn‚Äôt need a sauce. Next time I‚Äôll get the fries to dip - that would be so yummy!!

Nothing stood out for dessert but they brought out a small piece of chocolate cake with a candle. And oh yeah - the hostess and server both said happy birthday to my friend, which I thought was cute. The view was incredible, and the food/drink nice, but the service was the star. So welcoming.

And then our server gave us a tour of the restaurant to see the private booths and PDRs.

Recommend!  We spent $500 and shared 2 apps, filet, 2 sides, and cocktail & wine each - but that view and the service makes it so worthwhile!

Our waiter was fantastic, the aesthetic was amazing, the crowd was eclectic, and the food and cocktails were delicious. The only issue holding me back from giving a 5-star rating is we had to wait more than 1/2 hour to be seated at our reserved table. The wait was made a bit less annoying by complimentary saki and edamame, but still - 1/2 hour+ - really? Also, the DJ music could come down a notch to make it easier to hold a dinner conversation.

If you're going for the food, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. The sushi selection is quite limited, and while the wine selection is decent, The whisky selection is great. The atmosphere is loud, more like a night club than a restaurant, which makes it hard to enjoy the meal. The place seems to have an identity crisis: is it a sushi restaurant, a whisky bar, or a nightclub? Also, the fish tank is much smaller than expected, so don‚Äôt come here just for that.

Our waitress only did 1 check back to see how we were doing. I said great but we needed more water (party of 5) and she never came back with it. I had to flag down another person to get a bottle for the table. It's annoying, if I'm paying that much money, I shouldn't have to do any work like flagging down water for my family.

We‚Äôve been there for many a family celebration and had terrific pasta dinners and we‚Äôre always impressed with whatever the specials were. And the service? I wanna shout out to Leslie. She always welcomes us. And the other servers, as well as the bartender are beyond attentive. It‚Äôs nice to be made to feel at home. Read more One of the worst experiences in recent memory.  Pasta undercooked to a fault.  Tiny portions, outrageous prices. Never again!  Food was fresh and inviting. Outdoor patio was perfect. Experiencing the 4.4 earthquake that was very close added an element that won't soon forget. Staff were immediately checking to make sure we were fine. Read more We decided to try this restaurant to use our Open Table points valued at $25 here. When we arrived we found it to be on the expensive side, but that was okay, because it would be amortized by the $25 credit. The food was not great (all bland flavored and oddly crunchy as if undercooked), but it was a cute place for summer dining and we figured you win some, you lose some -- it was worth a try. But then when it came time to pay, the systems were down and they could not accept our $25. Of course, we tipped the full 20% because it was not our server's fault, but we were not happy - for 3 small dishes (stuffed peppers, ravioli caprese, and english pea risotto) it was $70, plus tax and tip cost us over $90! Crazy, and very disappointing. Read more Once you see an umbrella outside, that's the place. It was a hot summer day where I thought being in the patio would still be hot to eat comfortably but it was nice because they had plenty of trees with shade. So don't get discourage of the outdoor patio. Read more Service was shockingly subpar - bringing out the wrong dish is fine, being charged for wrong dish ok. However, when I pointed out the wrong dish charge, they tried to dismiss it by saying the actual order was the same price (it wasn‚Äôt).

It‚Äôs not really about the price but rather the poor attitude/service.

Also took forever to get drinks & for the server to come by to take our order. Read more Had a great dinner date on a Sunday night. It was a little noisy but that's what you should expect when sitting outside. Food was great, cocktails well balanced and the service was exceptional.  Such a chill place!

The food was very good. We started with the bruschetta which was new to the menu. Really enjoyed it and the bread for it tasted fresh.

I asked two times to speak with a manager, who never appeared and in fact by then our server had disappeared as well. A busboy asked if we were doing ok, and when I said ‚Äúnot really‚Äù he actually walked away as if I had said yes! Finally our entrees were delivered by the manager who asked me if I was always so unhappy. By then we had been there almost 2 hours. I explained that the service had been abysmal and he said I‚Äôm sorry if you feel that way but I think we‚Äôve been taking very good care of you. Completely unapologetic about the situation or for that fact even  acknowledging it. I have no idea what their problems were last night, but generally people are pretty forgiving if there is an acknowledgment and apology.

Really a lovely hotel rooftop location for a restaurant with plenty of greenery.  The brunch menu is easy and the food was great.  It was a mixed bag. I set my reservation for 2:30 and noticed online that they close at 2:30pm! I called them and they said they made a mistake and that I needed to get there asap before the kitchen closed. Why would they allow reservations at the time they closed?! The server said we had 8 minutes to decide our order.

In both my OpenTable notes (AND) with the hostess, I mentioned it was my husbands birthday. They did NOTHING for his birthday- although the table behind us got a cute dessert.

We asked for salt and pepper, which everyone's eggs needed, and we had to ask 3 times before we got them. Coffee is weak and eggs seemed a bit undercooked to many at our table. The french toast was good but not over the top (the way the waiter described it!). Prices are quite high for a super basic breakfast of eggs, bacon and potatoes.

It was a great experience‚Ä¶ The food was incredible and service was great  Echt de moeite waard te ervaren. Eten heerlijk!! Lekker sfeertje.  Seated promptly and in main indoor dining room which is the ‚Äúglasshouse ‚Äú. We started with the ahi tuna -chips were light and the ahi tuna was well seasoned with a good balance of citrus. The cinnamon roll was a ‚Äúpremeal‚Äùdessert for us & three of us could not finish it as it‚Äôs pretty huge. The lemon glaze was not overly sweet and the toasted walnuts added an extra texture to it. My friends ordered the chilaquiles and it came with a red and green salsa (divorcio) style. The dish was full of flavor and everything on the plate complemented each other! The hangar steak and kimchi fried rice was my main course. The steak came out as ordered - medium rare, and the eggs (sunny side up) were cooked perfectly. The glaze on the steak gave it a nice caramelization and the chef did a good job of not over saucing the dish. We enjoyed our drinks - LA Woman, The Bird, Purple Rain and Crazy in Love - all very refreshing for a brunch meal. Lisa was a great server and took care of us with a big smile. She was so pleasant and made this a superb ‚Äúgirlfriends brunch ‚Äú for us!! Read more Openaire was worth the 1:30 hours drive.

We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very full. We were immediately sat and the waiter took our drink and appetizer order quickly. Unfortunately we wanted a long time for a waiter to come back and take our entree order. The waiter was nice but seemed new. Another waitress kept coming by to help him. Our entrees were also brought out at different times. My friends pasta got cold while waiting for my lamb chops to come out. The Honey cake was outstanding. Read more The service and ambiance were great.
The food was below average. The wheel pasta was tasteless and so as the truffle, so disappointed for the price. The Caesar salad was basic also.
The drink was great. I guess instagram does what it does the best. promoting beautiful places.
Definitely not going back. Read more The Cacio E Pepe was amazing. Service was on point and the cocktails were amazing. Ôøº  It was underwhelming. Beautiful restaurant. The food was subpar, each dish we had had some type of issue. The bruschetta was ok but way too salty. The cheese wheel Cacio e Pepe was watery so it muted the flavor. Lamb wasn't bad but it was also too salty and the risotto had a muted flavor. Finally the scallops were ok but a bit overdone and the risotto in this also had a muted flavor. The food just wasn't flavorful. My friends had drinks and they were way too sweet.

Overall underwhelmed. Wouldn't go back. Nothing was repeat worthy. Read more Service was great, restaurant was so cool and loved the live music but sad that the food was just okay. We spent so much on the flaming cacio e Pepe and it was ice cold.  We made a last run at reservation as we were downtown and trying to find an Italian restaurant. What a find! We were with our dogs so they put us on the patio and it was quite comfortable. I loved that they knew I didn‚Äôt eat onions because they read my information on OpenTable! ÔøºWe were not super hungry so we started with the Bruschetta with Roman. It wasn‚Äôt a problem for them to make any changes we requested. This was a wonderful dish and I would even recommend this restaurant because of it!  Ôøº we decided to split the baked rigatoni Bolognese. As I did not want the bechamel sauce, they switched out for marinara without a fuss. The pasta was perfect. Love the vibe of restaurant inside, too. Our server, Bella, was on top of everything and dos a great job. Read more Very slow service, very high prices for the items served, very loud. It was a Saturday night, which can be a problem with crowds.
Would never consider returning. Read more It all started off with the parking situation! They had no valet, I guess valet was full. We had to go around for 20 minutes to find parking, then finally we valet with another restaurant Manuela. We walk in almost 40 minutes late. They accommodate us right away as the restaurant wasn‚Äôt that full. They were also  understanding of the the parking situation. Now, this is where it gets really really bad. We put in our orders right away as we were starving! My drink comes in 10 minutes which is fine, then followed by one of the appetizers‚Ä¶ we had to wait 30 minutes for our truffle French fries and 1 hour 15 minutes for two plates of pasta! The kitchen seemed a disaster, the chefs were in a panic mode‚Ä¶ no one was getting any food. All tables around us were waiting for their food. We knew coming in that service would be bad from all the reviews on Yelp, but yet we wanted to give it a try for its ambience and menu. The manager brought us a complementary honey cake and she was like here!! Sorry for the delay eat this until your food arrives. Really, you r expecting us to eat a cake before our main course. Long story short, my daughters pasta comes out after hour and 15 minutes cold and such a small portion and my ravioli which was disgusting! I don‚Äôt even know how I ate it. My daughter kept telling me, I can‚Äôt believe you ate that. At that point I was so starving, I ate and left the restaurant. We then took a bite of the cake and my daughter spit it out! It was so sweet and creamy! This place is overhyped! Overrated! Quality of food is horrible to what they‚Äôve priced. Good thing, I didn‚Äôt order a steak! What a horrible meat it would have been for paying $70. I wouldn‚Äôt step a foot in here ever again. If you want good service and quality food, this isn‚Äôt the restaurant for you. However, the only thing I enjoyed was my lychee martini. Not once our server came up to us apologizing for the delay or offering us bread and butter! We were given $3 off discount on our bill. Read more For this price point we were expecting much better food quality and service. They did not take our order all at once so it ended up taking over an hour for our entrees to come, I genuinely think they forgot our order. The staff did not communicate the delay clearly and I needed to get up and find our server to understand the delay. We had an 8pm reservation and didn‚Äôt end up getting it food till 10:20. Once the food arrived we weren‚Äôt given new cutlery and the pasta (which is over $30) was not edible. Half of our table was still hungry when we left the restaurant at 11pm and there was no manager in sight to speak to regarding our experience. I‚Äôm sure this place is great for cocktails but don‚Äôt bring your out of town family here for a nice dinner. If you‚Äôre going to charge $32-60 for an entree the least that could be done is to have a manager come and address the situation. We were so disappointed and will not come back.

Read more Read more The service is lackluster / had to explain allergy situation 3 times.  Bartender is running around serving - drinks arrive after course is completed.  The cheese wheel is a mush of pasta.  Service is slow and I am usually very patient. Ordered an app and two meals and that took 1.5 hours. Also all food came out warm, almost room temp. The vibe outside looks fancy the vibe inside is basic. Our server was nice enough but this dinner was not worth the price. Read more Our waitress was amazing, restaurant was beautiful but the food was terrible. We ordered the cheese wheel, did not meet our expectations at all.  Server was great & food was delicious, definitely on the pricier side, but definitely would come back!! The cacio e pepe was amazing  We had an incredible dinner experience on Thursday evening. Our server, Bella, was fantastic and provided excellent recommendations for both appetizers and the main course. During our meal, we enjoyed live music from a singer named Kiera Lyons, who was absolutely phenomenal! After dinner, we moved to the bar to get closer to Kiera and watch her perform. The owner, Sergei, was also there and generously bought us a round of drinks on the house! What started as a simple dinner turned into one of the most amazing and memorable nights. I highly recommend giving this place a try! Read more Overpriced! Overpriced! Overpriced! Payed 380 USD for 2 person and 1 kid-for nothing!

This so called Italian restaurant was discovered by me from Instagram a social media platform. It wasnt quite the show & experience, I have expected it to be. The service was okay but overall, I feel bamboozled. I ordered for my main course was the 'Wheel Cheese Cacio E Pepe' ,it was $68 for pasta & cheese basically & $15 add on for a small amount of truffles that was barely any shaved on to my plate. Also, I ordered half a dozen of oysters to give it a try & costed me $38 for poor quality. It wasn't cleaned correctly me & my wife had bits of shells in our mouths while chewing it was really unpleasant. Another order was 'Fish Of The Day' which was 'Sea Bream' $75 for a basic taste .
Overall basic & overpriced for everything.

The pasta cheese roll to die for  The drinks were great especially the pear martini 5 stars! The food was delicious however the portion size is so small and definitely not worth the price.

On arrival, things looked promising. The ambiance was charming, background music was on point, and the panoramic view certainly added to the appeal. We were initially attended to by a very cordial waitress which was impressive. 

However, things went downhill soon after she took our order. We felt utterly ignored as she seemed to have forgotten about us. There were things we needed, like more water, some hot sauce for our dinner, but no one came around to attend to us. This caused our food to go cold, which was really disappointing.

We finally decided to ask for a container to pack our scarcely touched, now cold, food. But even this routine request seemed to take an eternity to be fulfilled. It was pretty frustrating, to say the least. 

Before we left, the waitress did apologize for her lapses, but the damage was already done. The poor service had marred my date and our impression of the place.

Everything was delicious and I can't wait to come back!  Absolutely phenomenal!! The food and ambience were amazing. Our server was top notch. He knew the menu well and had great recommendations.

Pros:
- food 10/10
- service 9/10

Their lattes were good & I like how they serve them in mugs. Food was delish & service was great. Will deff go back!  The food is so divine, always creative and fresh.

Read more Very nice ambience, good food and service. Would definitely come back  Almost no complaints. Except they make you wait for en whole party ‚Ä¶.  Our food took forever to come.

Laughing Bird Shrimp Aguachile (Would reorder)
Diver Scallops
Snow crab (would reorder)
Wine: Riesling/Viognier, Scotty Boy! ‚ÄúLove*The Hand* That Klongs You‚Äù (would reorder)

The only thing I dislike was that I felt I was being rushed out of my table to pay.

Favorite date nite spot  food is excellent
 service is great
can't wait to go back
nice ambience Read more Definitely recommend. Great food and good atmosphere!  Rating exceeded our experience.
But it was late and close to closing but still open  Manuela never disappoints.  The food is exceptional, the service is attentive and the ambiance is lovely.  Hats off to their chefs and serving staff.  While there are parking options on the street, we were appreciative of the valet option.

They need to improve their service it took for ever to really catch the attention of the waitress. Also if you have a group of 6 or more people they will add the gratitude to your invoice which I found it very in appropriate and invasive . The place was recommended by a friend who hosted a dinner of 7 and when I asked about it she mentioned that she didn‚Äôt  have that experience. I guess I paid a $$$ gratitude for a bad service.

We started with the corn bread and Mac and Cheese.  Both were delicious.  The Elote corn was ok.  A bit hard to handle.  The shrimp cocktail was very good and the scallops were amazing.  We ended with the whole fish plate which was great. Read more The entrees are more of a collection of appetizers than an actual meal. Drinks with alcohol come with a very large block of ice leaving very little to drink. I was in a large group (8 people) they charge 20% extra for this. Service was pretty bad - I had to chase down the server to get the check and order food/drinks. We ended up waiting a long time to order and receive food as well as pay.

Ordered chicken and waffles and we were charged $2.00 for butter!!! Yep.  Overall everything was fantastic, The food, as well as the service. There were only 2 off putting things. One as the 3% charge to use a credit card, which is something we had never experienced in any restaurant anywhere. And second was the $1.00 charge for a large ice cube in a cocktail, especially when one of their signature cocktails comes with a large cube at no additional charge. If you are going to charge for an ice cube, that should be made clear by the server when taking a drink order. It's not the money, it's the principal.

I‚Äôd say the standouts were the hush puppies, whole fried game hen, cornbread and peach cobbler.  Ribs and octopus also solid.  We got the tomahawk pork chop, which had great grits and sauce, but was dry and overcooked.  That was the only miss of the night.  Will definitely be back, this place is excellent!

Mario our bartender gave us an elevated experience that made us not want to leave our seats. Chenoa was also very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients the chef used!
Everyone showed a level of passion for what they do that shined through the entire night!
We tried everything on the food menu (don‚Äôt judge us) 10/10 recommend. And for drinks the Happy Tini is where it‚Äôs at!! Read more They need more waitstaff, servers and runners.   one of our guests didn't receive their entree until long after the rest of us received our food.   the order in which we received our food seemed out of order.   cornbread for an appetizer, sides, then entrees.   No one ever cleared our plates.   It took a long time for our waitress to come back to give us dessert menus.   

The food was lackluster:  Grilled Octopus; Kale ""soup"" needed flavor.   Catfish was good I heard, Lamb was ok.
Mac and cheese and cornbread were the best.

Initially our waitress was upbeat and attentive.   As the night went on, you could tell she was frustrated with us asking for things; like where the last entree was and could we get the dessert menu.   

We would not return. Read more Absolutely top tier. 40 hour roast had me at hello. The drinks were incredibly effective and top shelf.  Really nice and attentive wait staff. Impeccable tasty dinner.

Our table was full and food was getting cold quicker than we could eat it, so we requested that they hold off on the last large plate. Not long after, while our table was still full (at this point it had only been about 30 minutes since we sat down and ordered), the server brings out the whole fish and asks us if we are ready for it. I was dumbfounded. I gestured that there was literally nowhere to put it on the table. He takes it back to the kitchen and the manager comes out to tell us that he didn‚Äôt want our fish to get cold. I explained that we had asked to hold off on the fish because we still had a table full of food to work through, so he took it back and kept it under a heat lamp or something. For a restaurant at this price point with the positive reviews on yelp, I expected some basic hospitality like common sense coursing of the meal. The food was fine - a few dishes were good (cornbread and perloo), most were okay. Read more I absolutely love Joyce. Christiana was an amazing waitress/bartender.

Greated immediately upon entering into an immaculate atmosphere and aesthetically pleasing restaurant. The service we received from Rob was outstanding.

This is the first restaurant that I have enjoyed myself from beginning to end in a very long time, I foresee this restaurant doing major things. Read more This was our first time visiting Joyce Downtown, and we really wanted to support this business ‚Äì we weren‚Äôt disappointed! As an upscale soul food establishment, Joyce delivers on flavor and atmosphere. The drinks were solid, definitely not watered down, which was a great start.

For lunch, we had the honey lavender fried chicken hen, which was very tasty, along with two pieces of their delicious cornbread topped with a salt and pepper butter spread, and a side of Mac & cheese. Everything was packed with flavor! While I do wish the fried chicken was served as whole pieces instead of the smaller hen, especially for the price, the quality and taste were excellent.

Overall, I‚Äôd definitely come back and highly recommend you give Joyce a try. We even got a chance to meet and congratulate one of the owners ‚Äì the service was fantastic, and we were happy to be there!

Joyce Downtown is a must-visit for upscale soul food fans. Read more We ordered oysters, they were fresh and the smoked duck was good, crispy and flavorful. We also ordered lamb , cornbread and Mac and cheese. The lamb was extremely fatty, even when we sent them back for leaner pieces, they came back with new  Ribs that were too fatty to enjoy, the cornbread was just ok. The Mac and cheese was rich but had a flavor that was sort of bitter on the end. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite. Read more We were outside. Food was very good we had cornbread fixed catfish, hush puppies, oysters rice with clams, sausage.
The server should wipe the table for the four of us between courses Read more I have been looking forward to going to Joyce‚Äôs and I was actually very disappointed. Great ambience, but the food was not great. The cornbread was good, and the chicken. But we went for brunch and took back the shrimp and grits, didn‚Äôt like the fried green tomatoes nor the waffle.

Read more The food was amazing - literally every dish our group ordered was VERY good. I took off one star because when the bill came there were random charges - $2 for salt (one person in our party ordered a regular margarita), $3 for butter (butter didn't come on the waffle with the Chicken & Waffle order), and then there was a 3.5% service fee which we found out later was for paying by credit card. When we brought this up to the host, she took off a few of them but it was still weird. Just set a slightly higher price for the food and drinks. Read more Food was not good. No taste to it. The dishes we ordered was just ok. They need more seafood dishes since the day Joyce Soul and seafood. Parking was public should have Valet. Our servers never ask if everything was ok.

Read more First, some of the best service we've experienced in recent years. EVERYONE was attentive, kind, alert and genuinely nice. 
Ordered the prix fixe menu and it seemed to be a great deal. Portion sizes didn't shrink so we got to gorge on half the restaurant's offerings for $93 a person. Even better, everything was so fantastic. There wasn't a bad dish all night. The cocktails also knocked us for a loop and it wasn't because of the booze.
Best of all, it was my birthday and they didn't do anything corny, they just did everything right. Read more Delicious and inventive food. Excellent service. Highly recommend.  We were excited to come back to Yangban after a few years not coming out to LA for many dinners. The immediate and total loss of character of the restaurant after the remodel is what hit us first. The Yangban of new is clearly trying to go for some fine dining awards instead of being a fun, energetic, and enjoyable place I‚Äôd want to return to with a big group.

We were given recs for an order that would have easily put the bill for the five of us at $150/person before any drinks (1-2 small plates per person, 4 starters or 2 with the banchan, and 4 entrees). We knew roughly what we wanted so we ordered the following:

3 small plates
2 starters
1 banchan
2 orders of wings

No complaints about the food! The chicken wings are worth traveling out of your way for. We‚Äôve thought about these wings for years and it‚Äôs always a concern that something won‚Äôt live up to years old impressions. It‚Äôs rare that they exceed them significantly! At $12/wing it‚Äôs a hefty price, but worth it.

So food out of the way‚Ä¶ service was incredibly rushed. We didn‚Äôt order much, but to be told that the team wants the full order at the start in order to pace the meal accordingly and then to spend exactly 30 minutes from checking in to walking out the door feels very wrong. We constantly had people walk behind us ready to grab a plate the moment they thought we were done rather than when we actually finished up. When asked about the tea salad, we said we were still eating it and the server just scooped it onto my son‚Äôs plate. All of the food was out ~6-8 minutes after ordering with the last to arrive being the mandu. Once we had finished the wings, they started to clear plates and silverware while a few of the banchan and mandu were left. My son ate the last of the mandu using the serving spoon because nothing was left to use on the table. We love the food and would‚Äôve ordered more, but we were never asked and it just would have been so awkward to ask with no tableware left. Read more Amazing Amazing Amazing.

It was such an amazing atmosphere and truly enjoyed our dinner there. We ordered the wings, tteok, banchan, hot stone rice, garleek bread, and goguma pie. I‚Äôm Korean and the food really blew me away. It was a new experience getting to try a fusion of Korean food. The only thing me and my girlfriend did not like was that the server recommended adding a couple of other ingredients in our dishes such as crab in our tteok or telling us he‚Äôll add an extra piece of chicken wing, but didn‚Äôt mention that we‚Äôll be getting charged for those additional things. The price came out  to a lot more than we expected and would‚Äôve appreciated a heads up that the extra ingredients would cost a bit more.

Read more Awesome service and atmosphere, but unfortunately the food was a mixed bag. We ordered the fixed price 6-course. The tomato toast, salad and tteok were all excellent (first 3 dishes to come). We also ordered the scallop dumplings, which were everyone's favorite - would highly recommend. The banchan looked great on paper, but in reality fell very flat - so flat that I didn't take second bites of any. The main dishes were the salmon and short rib, which were cooked to perfection but just didn't have any unique flavors or textures. The same applies to the chicken wings that came just before the mains. Dessert was great, but again, nothing super unique. Overall, I would recommend coming if you want a great atmosphere and aren't that hungry (order appetizers). Can't speak to the drinks, tea or coffee.

However, it was a lot of food, and the waiter did suggest adding an additional dish which was heavy and quite filling.

Read more Yangban used to be one of my favorite restaurants in LA. It definitely still has a place in my heart, but I miss the laid-back energy that they used to have before they remodeled.

Now the food, course 1 & 2 phenomenal!!! 10/10 New flavor combinations I would have never thought went together but all complemented each other in an amazing way.

Read more Overall experience was excellent server was very pleasant and knowledgeable. Noise level was a little loud towards the end of the dinner with more people in the dining room.  We ordered 4 dishes, none of which were worth the price. The main entree, branzino, had no flavor and was charred too much to where all we could taste was the burnt pieces. The other entree, pork fajitas, were chewy and not tender. Read more Overall we enjoyed the food and the location .

It was to the point where we had to make her aware that we had actually not finished ordering when she left the first 2 times Read more Beautiful restaurant 10/10. This is great for a dinner gathering with friends. However it is pretty noisy and very busy so i wouldn‚Äôt recommend if your looking for a quiet date night. The food was a hit and miss, somethings were amazing and some just lacked a little flavor maybe a little salt. However i would come back to try again. We had the ceviche sampler and seafood platter. The shrimp on the seafood platter was 12/10! Ahmaaazinnggg. The ceviche platter there was 4 different ones to try, 2 of them were delicious and the other two just lacked some flavoring Read more Never again‚Ä¶
FOOD was gross and and so many flies buzzing around the table and window we were seated at.

Came based off a well known foodie reviewer.

My guess is they were paid to promote because it was horrible. Read more the menu was kind of uncomfortably expensive - especially for mexican in LA.  Our server Michael was extra friendly, super attentive, and made our experience all around great!  Came here for the first time for a solo birthday treat and they did not disappoint!  While the food was very good the noise level is so high it is impossible to carry on a conversation as a group; it is even difficult to speak to the person sitting next to you. Unfortunately, we all ate quickly so we could leave and converse elsewhere- So disappointing!
I would not recommend Encanto because the noise level is so high you cannot enjoy the company you are with Read more Read more Overall dining experience was great.

Definitely will be back again and again. Read more Lovely and amazing food and cozy. But unnecessary to have a dj playing at 5:30pm on a Thursday  The issue I have with Encanto has nothing to do with the food or service.
Honestly the food was fine and the service was nice.
The issue I have is that the restaurant is a card-only and doesn‚Äôt clearly state that anywhere.
It is wild to me than I brought cash to pay for my meal and was told they were ‚Äúcashless‚Äù only once it came time to pay the bill.
Luckily my date had a card, but it sure would have been nice to be more upfront about something as critical as payment methods if they‚Äôre going to restrict folks from paying with cash.
Places that choose this and in effect remove the ability for folks without credit cards to patronize them do so at their own peril.
I won‚Äôt be coming back strictly due to this policy. Read more The food was amazing! The staff was outstanding. Great place to eat before a show or meet up with friends‚Ä¶ actually any excuse is good to go eat there. 10/10  Everything was great and the food is delicious, but I did not like the fact that they don't accept cash as a method of payment. I also didn't like how the parking is difficult and there's no valet. So I'm not sure if I will go back due to these reasons. Read more The ambiance was great! The I‚Äôve DJ was fun and the margaritas were amazing! The food had good flavor but unfortunately it was incredibly spicy and there was no warning on the menu. Spicy food doesn‚Äôt usually bother me but is wasn‚Äôt even mild to moderate spicy it was SUPER spicy and actually made me not feel well unfortunately. I feel like there should be warnings on the menu about the spice level when it‚Äôs that hot Read more Always Love my experiences at EN CANTO.
Fantastic environment, food and service is outstanding  Not only the dishes and drinks were delicious but the attention to detail, presentation and service was absolutely amazing. Make sure to order the Fancy Guac, Grilled Corn and Ceviche platter.  I only put 4 star on service because i believe our server had too many tables and it made service slower, other than that everything is excellent.

Bartenders Reuben and Herson always take care of us like we are best friends. Tried the tuna tostada and the house salad which were both excellent. The new DJ had a great curated selection of music. So great to have this place in our neighborhood! Read more Excellent service and excellent food. Loved the Mexican mid-century decor  We waiting 10 minutes before the waitress asked if we would like water. Waitress didn‚Äôt know what they were out of certain items after we ordered and came back to tell us they‚Äôre out. Ôøº  They Charge for Chips/salsa..

The Steak was like leather, So not worth trying 

And they charged $14. for one piece of corn cut in half?? That is outrageous and so disappointing 

I think this is over hyped and way to expensive for Mexican Food

We ordered a Tomohawk steak, lobster Mac & cheese, and guacamole (came with chicharrones). Despite ordering our steak medium, it was cold. The lobster Mac & cheese was just noodles with cheese and shredded lobster on top. The guac was probably the best thing that I had ordered.

The bartender seemed to be a bit lost . When we asked for lamb chops he told us they didn‚Äôt serve them , yet they were on the menu .
We ended up ordering them and then after two minutes, asked if we could cancel them to order something else ;without asking the kitchen he simply told us ‚Äúno‚Äù , which was fine. It wasn‚Äôt a problem, but at the end of the night after paying our bill on the machine he gave usÔøº he stopped us from leaving, accusing us of not paying the bill, but kept the tip we gave him in cash.Ôøº I tried showing him the receipt that was texted to my phone, but he refused to look at it and  waved me off and instead went to his manager. after waiting a minute and seeing him and his manager go back-and-forth I went over and asked if there was a problem and that‚Äôs when the manager also gave me an attitude after I pulled my my phone out to show them the receipt of paying the bill .Ôøº after finding whatever they were looking for he gave the bartender the thumbs up and then rudely asked me ‚ÄúDid I want a receipt‚Äù after I‚Äôve already showed the receipt on my phone.

Every area is great for pics (& they also have a photographer!)... My only recommendation is to please please please specify on the menu that the guacamole comes with pork rinds and not tortilla chips -- we all took pretty big bites before realizing the chips were actually pork & it really ruined our initial pallet for the food to come as none of us eat pork.  Other than that, the night was perfect!  Oh, and the bday celebration with lights and signs and a bday shot made the night perfect!  Thanks! Read more Crazy spot. Not a destination for a solid meal. Under staffed and super loud.  Great experience with regard to the concept. However the service seems to have a disconnect amongst severs and additional staff.  It seems the service is an attempt to ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù but the servers are not in sync. I would suggest to let patrons know that food comes out as ready perhaps. Not sure.

Until then, it‚Äôs a bar vibe festivities with the allure of fine dinning with. Almost there‚Ä¶ Read more Great food and experience will go back soon! The food was excellent and the energy was lively!  We were really excited to go to this restaurant and it started off great with the very welcoming host.  From there it went downhill, the music was so loud you could hardly hear, and we struggled to speak to each other throughout dinner.  We ordered chip and guacamole, and the chips came in a plastic bag, and they tasted like they came out of a plastic bag.  Well, I guess it matched the guacamole as it didn't taste fresh either. Our server was friendly enough but disappeared for long periods of time throughout dinner leaving us to ask other servers walking by for help.  Luckily, they were very nice and very helpful.

The food, my husband had a steak which was small for the cost, but he said it had good flavor.  However, the Chorizo Mac n Cheese ... just say NO.  It was late to the table (we had to ask for it), and we should have just left it off.  I had the salmon, which was good, I asked for it to be prepared medium and it was rare it went down OK but gave me problems later.  One of our friends had the fried lobster and loved it, his wife had chicken and Potatoe enchiladas and said it was weird and not good.  Our food review is somewhat mixed, but we all agreed we would not return. If you're celebrating a birthday, it might be fun as they go all out but you won't be able to talk to anyone in your party before or after the celebration.  Wanted to love it but just didnt'. Read more would not recommend this location! the service was horrible.  Porque cobrar 20% por servicio en una mesa para dos personas cuando el cheque es m√°s de $200 d√≥lares  I really enjoyed the food and the ambience of the restaurant. Our server was attentive. But after a while, even though the restaurant was more than half empty, there was a constant barrage of people coming, taking our plates without asking us if we were done and making us feel kind of rushed. If people had been waiting, that would be totally different, but there was no one waiting and as I mentioned, the restaurant was half empty. That put a bit of a shadow on our evening with our friend that we took for a special birthday dinner. I should also mention that our reservation was at five so the whole goal was to get there before the restaurant got extremely busy. When we left, the restaurant still was not full.

We often come down to this restaurant before an event. It‚Äôs one of my favourites! However, this time, it didn‚Äôt live up to our expectations. We arrived 1.5 hours before our event. The patio had a few tables on it and the inside seemed typical. We opted to sit outside and it took a long time to even get water, when our server finally took our order he asked if we were needing to be out of there for an event and we said yes, needed to leave at 720pm. He said I‚Äôll put everything in now as our kitchen is quite backed up. The appetizers arrived but then no mains. He came by and said ‚Äòyour order is next up‚Äô so we said ok, we can wait (that was around 7pm), by 725 nothing had shown up so we had to grab our bill and go. We JUST made it to our event.

My mom‚Äôs chicken came 1 hr after all of the rest of the food and it was too tough to eat. He hardly checked on us and did not keep track of if we got our food.

I recommend the Salmon Lemon roll and the brussel sprouts!  Good OK! Hugely expensive but probably cause of rent due to LA LIVE which has to be extraordinary!

If you order the steak, make sure to cut into it to make sure temp correct. Restaurant used to not cooking steak so if not done enough you can send back for a little more heat vs. having to flag down the server while rest of table is eating.

Purchased from the Dine LA Menu, pricing was high and food was mediocre.  The first course was great, but we had 2 different main courses, and neither was good.

Sometimes the food is hit and miss on the entr√©es

The ribeye steak was really a bad piece of meat

The fillet was fantastic

We had to keep waiting extended period of time to get drinks

Always a great ambience, but opportunity for them to improve if they want to stay competitive

After all, this was our anniversary, and I would‚Äôve hoped it would‚Äôve been slightly better ÔøºÔøºÔøº Read more First time here. We really enjoyed the mussels, shrimp, sea bass and fillet mignon.  I booked through OpenTable for my sister‚Äòs birthday and on the notes I asked for them to customize the menu with her name and happy birthday celebration that was not done when we asked about it because we got the regular menus we were told that as a comp they would give her the free dessert for her birthday. Whatever she chose and she chose the lava cake and we were still charged for it. I don‚Äôt remember for $16 or $18, that was kind of a bummer because I wanted her to have a souvenir. She doesn‚Äôt live in Southern California so it was just going to be an experience for us but unfortunately a couple of things didn‚Äôt make it the best. The food and the service was really good so I would recommend it overall. Read more Beautiful restaurant. Prefect for a date night. Delicious cocktails and food.  We had a 7:00 reservation and they were out of a few items. Of course they were out of what I wanted. It doesn't seem like they planned or bought enough to be out of items so early in the evening.

I would return nonetheless as The Little Door is wonderfully unique.

Most importantly the attention to detail with food allergies was outstanding. Thank you!!  I have been to The Little Door many times over the years and have always had a wonderful time enjoying their great food. In recent years, however, the food has just gotten better and better over this and my last few visits.

We loved it  The 7-Course dinner was excellent, wine and juice pairings worked well with the meal. Nice to see a well crafted non-alcohol option.  The restaurant design, and service were impeccable.  Unfortunately, while the ingredients, method of cooking, and plating were all perfectly done, the taste just wasn't up to par.  Our waiter asked us if there was any stand out course from the fixed menu and everything was pretty lackluster with the exception of the amuse-bouche (which wasn't even part of the menu).  The fixed menu did provide an option for the main entree, which was either California Milk Cow (in other words steak) or Guinea Hen.  The steak was a $25 up charge and was basically just a rib eye cut that was the size of a small slider.

Each dish surprised in its complexity, bespoke ingredients and flavor.  I would certainly eat here again.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was how low the plants and rope chandeliers were since the impeded line of sight even with people sitting next to you.  Otherwise, the wait staff were professional and warm.  They were willing to go the extra mile, like bringing a blanket for the outdoor area because of the cooler temps.  I would certainly eat here again.  It‚Äôs a special lifetime experience not to be missed.

Meteora is definitely the best restaurant so far for me ...fell in love ‚ù§Ô∏è  The food transports you to different parts of the world.  I have dined at Meteora many times before and it's usually been excellent however the night that we went, the timing of the courses was notably off and delayed. The couple next to us got there right before and another couple 2 tables down got there after us and they were both 2 entire courses ahead of us. The entire meal lasted 3 hours due to this.  There was plenty of staff - we saw staff constantly circulating so I have no idea what happened. When I said something, they were apologetic and offered us more drinks on the house, which I did appreciate, however, I really wasn't planning on such a long dining experience and disliked that we were essentially forgotten for the first half of our time there. Read more Food and service were incredible. Mixed drink pairing with the food highly recommended. The first drink they made was fantastic  Hands down the best restaurant in LA. Gorgeous atmosphere.  Impeccable food and service.  Beautiful presentation.  Not traditional style.  But so much better.  Love Chef Jordan Kahn‚Äôs approach to all. Read more I‚Äôve grown to expect more from Michelin Star restaurants, perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what Meteora‚Äôs intentions are but I couldn‚Äôt decipher the point of view. A bountiful journey through nature? I guess. For one of my fellow diners the amuse was the most exciting part of the 7 course meal. The compressed melon was a fantastic bite. Personally the yam dish was a winner. I left wanting to adapt the fish dish into something I can make at home. The strawberry sorbet was a refreshing way to end the meal. Service was a bit messy. Cocktails were forgotten and promises to ‚Äútop off‚Äù a juice went unfulfilled. The hybrid drink pairings were uninspired but all were tasty. Not running back to meteora, mostly due to the copious dining options LA has to offer. Read more Read more Good things:
1: Very good ambiance. If you like taking pictures this is the right place.
2: the front door is very unique looking and immediate draws our attention.
Bad things:
1: food taste too salty overall. The salt is overpowering all the courses. Won‚Äôt ever go back because the food is really not that great considering $200+ for a 7 course meal without drinks.
2: service is mediocre consider this is a 1 star Michelin restaurant.
A:I notice the waiter spilled some water on the table when he was serving water but ignored it and left the little area damp the entire time. No biggy, but most fancy place we go have more efficient and quick service cleaning the table.
B: after our meal we were ready to pay and leave but no one was aware while we tried to get attention. So we walked to the front door trying to see if we could pay there. The lady said the we will get our bill on our table so we went back sitting down. I think in most cases the lady will talk to someone so we can get our check but that didn‚Äôt happen. So we waited a few more minutes try to raise up our hand up until someone saw us.
C: we chose steak as our main dish and end up paying 50 dollars more for 2 people. there is extra charge for getting the steak. The price difference was on the menu but i think it will be nice if the information was orally  delivered to the customers as well. (By the way the steak pieces are very small, I have a feeling that they just want to charge extra sneakily. They advertise the course to be 150 but then there is also a 4% LA health fee which is calculated into the total meal cost) so 150+(steak and health fee) turned into 200. And you have to pay a percentage of tips based on your whole bill. 2 people will be 120 dollars more out of their sneaky charge.

Overall, if you like to experience the environment and have some extra money to spend then this place is ok. I don‚Äôt think it was worth if you want good food.

Our server was fine and I hoped she would be a bit more elegant in speaking and / or presentation as she her language and energy were not as up to par as her coworkers. 

This is not a dig at her at all but I wish we had a different server. I know this is super specific and nuanced here - just want to be honest.

Beautiful building, exceptionally decorated.  As two young parents who typically have meals around 5pm, we were wondering how this recent Michelin-rated restaurant would be serving us at 5:30, the very moment they usually open.

The food is arguably the most flavorful I‚Äôve ever had. It was stunning to see and we savored every dish.

Highly recommend  Great little gem tucked into a very busy area in a little parking lot.  Great food, ambience and attention to service.  The service at Greekman's is friendly. A good spot for neighborhood locals.  Excellent food. Blindsided by an 18 percent service charge on top of expected tip - for just two diners. Didn‚Äôt see mention of service charge because it appeared in microscopic print at bottom of menu page (almost invisible in dim light of restaurant). Everyone would be better served if the service charge were incorporated into the price of the actual food. That way, diners can decide if the menu items merit value. All the high service charge is going to achieve is lower tips for the actual servers. This restaurant is basically hitting diners with a 50 percent surcharge above menu prices when you take into account 18 percent service charge, 20 to 25 percent expected tip and Los Angeles sales tax. Also no filtered tap water for the high prices. Everything on the menu is excellent. If you have cash to burn and aren‚Äôt bothered by a high service charge (especially with WGA and SAG strikes forcing people to tighten their belts in an industry town - my situation), then you can‚Äôt go wrong. I‚Äôm all for restaurant workers to be paid a fair wage, but this jacked-up service charge (usually reserved for bigger parties) is deceptive and a major turn-off. I likely won‚Äôt be coming back.

Musso's was, as always, perfect.  Each course was truly fine food - the Musso's special salad was amazing (and must be shared!  It's for two or three people at least, and a four-way split would make nice starter salad portions); our filets mignons were perfect (one medium rare, one rare, each done just as ordered every time we dine there); the potatoes au gratin were delicious (and one side of that could serve five); and although we were so full we had to share a piece, no trip to Musso's is complete without cheesecake for dessert.

We started with martinis at the bar.  It's my very favorite bar ever.  The drinks are perfectly made, and generous - with what won't fit in the glass poured into a tiny carafe served on ice.

My first times at Musso's were sixty or more years ago, when my grandfather would take the family when I was a kid.  The place is a time warp, except for the prices.

We finished with a chocolate cake.   We enjoyed a nice bottle of champagne from the extensive wine list.   The food was awesome and the service was great.   We will definitely be back when we are in the area. Read more We love the Water Grill.

One was a contractor in logistics the other a chef in London and Paris.
What they both have in common besides the love of good food is the love of street culture. Years ago they met in Paris during a regular sale of shoes at the Place de la R√©publique‚Ä¶
From this meeting, the pair launched into a collaboration of sharing their passion for food. They started with pop-up restaurants with the aim of offering gastronomic street food to all, from a range of mixed recipes from different cultures and from gastronomic food to street food. Then, they had a brainwave‚Ä¶. Resulting in to transforming their Pop-ups into a real restaurant in downtown LA. From PARIS to LA come and travel with us.

Ever since then, our goal has been to showcase not only our family recipes, but also the hard work and dedication that goes into each of them. Each year, we travel to Oaxaca, and hand pick our ingredients, and carefully select the people we partner with.

I never make any reviews on the restaurants I go to. However, the food was not good my second time. It felt as if they bury added any meat to the food. The food was not hot when it came out.

Hopefully they improve their food management. Read more If you enjoy mol√© then this is the place for you.

I was upset because my food came out stone cold even the meats and the survey said because they ate thin meats. He was nice to change it but the response was a bit weird since I too am Oaxacan and also work in a restaurant and know almost all meat is not served cold even the chorizo was stone cold. Would I come again possibly but im happy my dad at least had a good birthday. Read more The food and drinks were excellent.  We sat outside on the patio and it was perfect. Will definitely be going back.  We loved the experience, service and the food was fabulous.  Food is outstanding. Fun atmosphere, great employees.  This is the second time we went, and we brought friends. Hoping for a spectacular experience like we had last time, but unfortunately, we were a little disappointed. First, they charged almost $18 for a small bowl of watered-down guacamole with a tiny portion of chips. It tasted OK, but that price was excessive. The food portions were significant, as usual, and the fried fish was excellent! But I noticed this time that they're charging extra for rice and beans, so if you wanted both, it would be almost $10. I think that's cheap to charge extra for rice or beans with a full price entr√©e.

That said, all in all the service was wonderful. The atmosphere is fun (outside) and the flan dessert was spot on so I am reducing it to three star experience because of the overpricing structure. Debating whether to come again. I hope someone there reads this and reevaluates how they charge customers. Read more Made a reservation at 4 for a party of 3. The hostess was nice and welcoming but the lady who walked us to our table had a horrible demeanor. The place was more than empty and she wanted to sit us in a corner at the very back of the restaurant, when I suggested a different table she made a face and rolled her eyes. The server was nice but didn‚Äôt seem to have waiter skills or experience. 


The tlayuda dish is incredibly overpriced, they charge  extra for every single ingredient that is supposed to be on a tlayuda. Cheese, meats, tomato, avocado etc. the worst thing is that the $7 & $6 extra charge for each doesn‚Äôt justify the tiny portion. 5-7 thin slices of avocado & tomato and the string cheese barely covered the dish. 
Same thing for the appetizer we got queso fundido and had to pay for the tortilla on the side ( they didn‚Äôt tell us it‚Äôd be extra)  The guacamole was watered down and flavorless for $18 I was hoping to at least taste some avocado. 
Queso fundido, 3 tlayudas, 3 aguas frescas (one refill) 2 caf√© de olla $190

Bad choice in my part. Read more Really great mix of cheerful, casual ambiance and sophisticated menu with lots of ways accommodate vegetarian and vegan diets. Only limitation was among wine options . Great beer and mezcal choices but could have  a broader wine list. One tip: I ordered the vegan version of the Laura having no idea what it would turn out to be.

The timing of the food was off; I received my main before the app. And I had to re-order the wine that accompanied the main.  Muy buen lugar, excelente experiencia, muy buena comida.

It was unclear which building the restaurant was located in, as well as the parking, which turned out to be $25 for both valet and self-parking. Then there was no signage or person directing us to where the restaurant was upon entry. That being said, we got there more than 30 minutes past our reservation and the hostess was super rude about it, saying we missed the grace period and could only have our table for an hour before we‚Äôd be kicked off for another reservation. Then the servers were flighty and kept forgetting to put certain orders in. Just awful. All around. But the food was god. Read more I love that there is so much to do all in 1 place.  This was in the same building as the hotel we stayed at for a concert at the Peacock Theater. It was hard to get into coz of the clubs within the same floor, so advanced booking is recommended. Security was tight. Food was average. The whole floor is definitely for the Gen Z crowd. Our waiter was attentive and the DJ was cool and friendly. Will dine only again coz of its close proximity to the concert venues. Read more Lucky Mizu never disappoints. Every visit is surprisingly better than the last. The food is amazing, the service staff is wonderful, and the earth harp is quite the experience. After batting 3/3, I can count on any night at Lucky Mizu to be memorable. Read more Steven our server, was the best!! He delivered excellent service and we love going to Lucky Mizu for the beautiful ambiance, good drinks, and good vibes. Ask for Steven !  Excelente servicio lugar muy lindo y precio muy bien. Calidad y servicio  Such a disappointment to have a stunning venue with unfortunate food. The menu includes almost no variety. We ordered 4 rolls and could only eat one of them. The remaining ones were basically rice and mayonnaise. Disgusting. I ordered some king salmon sashimi, they brought me A5 wagyu sashimi instead, I accidentally ate it thinking the dark hue was the fact that it was drowning in soy sauce. I am pescatarian‚Ä¶ I was sick for hours.
The venue still forced us to pay over $75 for 3 small bowls of soup and the one roll we ate.

As someone who is also a restaurant professional-
Please, get a new executive chef. Read more This place had great performances and a great atmosphere  Terrible service experience. The table lost power. They forgot our check. The server couldn‚Äôt explain anything. I was so disappointed.  amazing place but the actual food is not great. its very very expensive and very small portion. you will be hungry after unless you order multiple entrees.  Read more This was most certainly one of my worst dining experiences of ALL TIME.

Despite having a reservation, it took OVER an hour and a half to actually be seated.
It took fifteen minutes just for a host to even speak with us while waiting.

After being told to wait to be seated, it took asking multiple times and an EXTREMELY rude hostess saying there‚Äôs other people that need to be seated (after having already waited an hour WITH a reservation at that point) to finally get a seat.

The service remained slow, the food average, and the prices exorbitant.

Top it off with AUTO 20% gratuity and a payment screen that auto selects 20% for ADDITIONAL gratuity, and I can‚Äôt say I left with a pleasant taste in my mouth in ANY WAY.

I will NOT be returning to Lucky Mizu, and I ABSOLUTELY do NOT recommend visiting. Read more Massively disappointed in the experience and communication. I was so excited to try this place out. My husband and I have worked in hotels and upscale bars in our past and travel the world to upscale and super fun establishments all of the time.  I had been dying to come to Level 8. Mainly I wanted sushi, oysters or shabu shabu and wanted the most to go to sinners and santos.

lucky Mizu was the only place available when i looked it up. We love sushi. And wanted to try Shabu Shabu together. We normally dislike pre fixed meals. I dont like truffle or tempura. But love all vegetables seafood and wagu. I had also been dying to see sinners and santos. I asked multiple times in text, on open table, on answering machines and live calls- if the only way we could order was prefixed. They said yes. I asked if that guaranteed choice of Shabu Shabu with sashimi. We don‚Äôt like prefixe. I like sushi. I would pay prefixe if we got to try and cook ourselves and the fee got us entrance into sinners and santos. They said yes over and over. We would get sushi and our choice of shabu shabu. And get in to sinners and santos.

We went. Other people got out of prefixe. Our meal was late and expensive and not what we wanted. The second course came before our drinks. I hate truffles and dislike tempura. And we left hungry. Watching other people order what we thought we could. And sinners and santos wasn‚Äôt even open. I was livid.

The staff was wonderful (seriously) just totally clueless to what we paid for. But we were MASSIVELY disappointed.

Also the bathrooms were dirty and trashy and halls dirty.

We are in love and still going home happy with each other.

But Worst use of money we‚Äôve paid in so long. Read more Although the ambiance and performances were entertaining our experience at Lucky Mizu was very disappointing. It took over 15 minutes to get our order in. We received our hot pot meat 10 minutes before our vegetables and our sides (rice, sauces, noodles). We asked Chris another waiter who was working near us if we could call our waiter to receive the rest of our hot pot items so we can eat. Instead of ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find out what‚Äôs going on with your order‚Äù. He rudely replied ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just get your meat right now?‚Äù When we replied ‚Äúno‚Äù he became even more rude and decided to say ‚ÄúOhh really, that‚Äôs odd.‚Äù And proceeded to walk away after. We waited another 30 minutes to get our check. They automatically charged 20% gratuity on our check. No wonder the workers here feel entitled to treat their customers poorly. They don‚Äôt have to provide the customer service worthy of a 20% gratuity. I have worked as a waitress for over 6 years and understand how hard being a waiter can be. But our experience was disappointing. Read more If you want over priced mid sushi üç£ come here. Drinks were good, there was entertainment as well. Service was decent, but not to be automatically charged 20%!!! Thought this was complete unfair when it was only two of us. We had 5 items and 3 drinks and total was almost $300 including the 20% service charge. Not to mention the $12 table that I was unaware of. Apparently it was Evian water, when it was being refilled from a pitcher. CRAZY! Read more Service was poor and the serving size was very small with very high prices. We did not get utensils until we were almost done and my friend ordered a second drink that never came. They also added a 20 percent tip which I would not have left. Only thing that saved it was ambience. Read more Very stinky place you smell a horrible fish smell mix with meat from the moment you enter the place not even the restaurant loud very loud we had to leave as soon as we walked in  Overpriced and not much food for the price. I think the menu is pretty vague as well.  The fish quality and overall food quality is not good. So many other places to go for sushi in LA. Being here is all about the vibe and performance if you‚Äôre looking for dinner in a club atmosphere. This is not something people who care about food would dine. Read more This is a bar where they serve sushi, and Ramen . The food was delicious, but is not to be considered a place where you go for dinner it's more a night club setting that serving sushi and drinks.

The highlight of the restaurant is the ambiance and look of everything, quirky and polished at the same time. Where it needs improvement is the quality of the food and guest experience. For such a polished place the staff, quality of ingredients and food, did not seem to meet that level. Aside from the decor and music, nothing to write home about. Read more Read more incredible!!!! lucky mizu and all of level 8 is a must. sit at the bar for the hot pot to avoid sharing a pot if you want your own (2 per table vs 1 per seat at the bar) and to better see the harp! incredible staff, experience and food. 10/10 Read more Had really high expectations for Lucky Mizu since quite a few people told me they had enjoyable experiences here. Unfortunately, my fianc√® and I didn‚Äôt feel the same. Immediately upon entering the speak easy style restaurant you are smacked in the face with a pungent fishy smell. We were seated at the bar and ordered the sushi and seafood hotpot. I advise getting a table because the for some reason the hot pot station is an awkward distance away from where you‚Äôre sitting. I found myself stretching to eat from the pot. All the seafood arrived raw as expected but when cooked it was obvious that it was not fresh seafood! The decor is cute but we found it to be overpriced and quite literally funky‚òπÔ∏è Read more The staff at Mizu was so awesome to us being first timers with Shabu Shabu‚Ä¶. Particularly Aliyah our waitress, the chef Hisae who walked us thru it, and bartender Harvey who made us some killer lychee martinis. Definitely coming back! Read more Food was mediocre. Room/Venue design was nice. Entertainment was unique but the poor layout and the staff/kitchen noise made it hard to enjoy.  The sushi and shabu shabu were great, particularly the ribeye. The service was good, but the food arrived before our drinks.
Definitely will go back.  Pretty empty place when we went. Felt very nicely put together. It was fun to walk through several doors to get the restaurant. They acknowledged our reservation and immediately were led to be seated. Also made good on the special request and special occasion for the evening.

Food was pretty but pricey. I'd probably do some apps and split a shabu rather than individual portions.

Cocktails were awesome. Wine and sake list was huge.

Service was super friendly and fun. A very energetic and funny server who was very attentive. Read more First time there and Harvey/staff were magnificent. Beautiful quaint space. Had a harp performance before us. Definitely a place to check out. The food was great order Kobe sushi rolls, bluefin and other items. All with very nice presentation and better taste. Will for sure head back again. Read more Terrible service. Had to wait 30 mins before getting seated and we had a reservation. Our server never came to check on us or ask if we wanted more drinks or food. Never even received a dessert menu. Had to ask another server for utensils and bowls. Read more Cool experience and the food was actually good. Drinks were unique and the entertainment there was as well. A little on the pricey side but overall good experience  Sensory overload with the high volume of sound and music. Hardly able to chat with my friends eating there. Two of my friends actually cannot handle the amount of noise and had to leave early due to that.
Food was good, expected better for the price range.

We had the calamari, split a pizza and finished with a baby kale salad. All very delicious!  Not great! In fact quite meh and very pricey at that. The charred octopus appetizer was okay but the potatoes were nearly raw. The scallop appetizer was delicious but at $26 completely overpriced for 2! - only 2 - scallops. The branzino special was inedible. It had gross, soggy skin, a fishy smell and taste and again undercooked potatoes.

ÔøºThe large pasta bowl finally comes and there is a tiny scoop of paccheri there looking sad and lost amongst all the empty space.   Ate those 7 or 8 bites and then added the ($21) Baby Spinach salad with balsamic dressing to my meal to make up for not actually having a meal. The greens come drowning in oil, not a drop of balsamic to be tasted.  My vegan friend ordered the Penne ($24) without cheese, but requested a little arugula instead. The waiter came back and said we would need to be charged extra for those few leaves. Ridiculous. We countered with how could the cost of a few salad leaves possibly be more than the cost of the cheese that would have been in the dish to start with?  He went back to the kitchen and then came back with a plate of greens - for no extra charge. The whole meal felt miserly - not at all the upscale dining experience we were expecting.

Excellent service and delicious food - we‚Äôll be back!  We had an enjoyable experience.  The food was creative, unusable, and very  delicious. Abernathy‚Äôs  was very convenient to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion where we were seeing a performance.  We will go back. Read more Delicious food. Really enjoyed the selections from chef Pyet. The service was lovely, but they could use a bit more staff.  We go to Abernethy‚Äôs regularly and we‚Äôve enjoyed every chef and menu, but this one was our favorite. The inventive, exciting dishes were so special, you cannot find this food anywhere else in LA.  Chef Pyet DeSpain should have a permanent restaurant, because I want to eat her food on every special occasion. It was incredible.

The service at Abernethy‚Äôs is always wonderful. Our meals have taken quite a while to come out the last two trips, so give yourself extra time when making a reservation. They get slammed with the pre-show crowds.

We love our date nights of dinner and a show at the Music Center and Aberbethy‚Äôs is a romantic, special date spot. Read more Chef DeSpain's Indigenous American cuisine  is fantastic. Reminded me of my trips to Owamni in Minneapolis. Culturally important  and delicious.  A must try.  What distinguishes Abernethy's from other restaurants is its practice of bringing in guest chefs.  They bring a tremendous variety of cuisine styles  with an attentive staff to complement the qualities of the meals. Read more We had an absolutely lovely evening after attending the opera, this is such a great location. The premise of rotating chefs is very unique and creative. We have been here a few times and the food is always excellent. Service always great. Service on this particular evening by Nadia and Jihoon was above par! They were extremely attentive, very friendly, very informed, an overall excellent evening. Ôøº Read more Read more Terrific concept of rotating chefs!  Lunch before Sunday matinee was efficient.  Focus on Mexican & indigenous food was great.  Server was most helpful and suggested sharing plates, which is our preferred approach to dining..  Food came out quickly.  Corn-fried quail was outstanding.  The bison was tender and flavorful, but the blue corn cake was dry (despite the jus).  Tried all three desserts.  The Mexican corn pudding (more like flourless chocolate torte) with chocolate espresso sauce & pine nut palanquetas was top notch.  The Mexican Corn cake with macerated fruit was very dry and could have used more whipped cream.  The ""cookies"" with creme du leche were quite tasty but dry; very little sauce on plate to bring out more taste & moisture.  Overall a good meal with the variety we sought.
Would recommend reservations before the theater/opera matinee crowd comes in since dessert service slowed some with that on rush. Read more Limited mrenu.
Everything was too salty.
Flavors were too authentic to my taste‚Ä¶  Our second time here. Both visits featured good service, delicious food and a nice ambience. This is a perfect pre-theater spot if are seeing a show at The Music Center.  Food was fantastic! Unfortunately there was a miscue with the kitchen and we didn‚Äôt get our mains for an hour and had to rush to get to our show at 8pm. We sat down at 6:30 and didn‚Äôt get served until 7:40. Appetizers and drinks came out quickly though and were delicious. Read more Perfect dinner before a show!  Don't sleep on the food! Excellent dishes!  Good drinks.  Great way to relax before going into the theatre.  It will surprise you!  First, let me say that I love the Music Center Plaza!  Even with a noisy event happening in Grand Park, it's a great place to be!

There were four of us.  The jerk catfish and the salmon dish were very much enjoyed.  The pork chop was very expensive ($48) and flavorless.  And the less said about the grilled peach and tomato salad the better.

The service was really slow.  About 15 minutes after we placed our drink order, I went inside to see if we were anywhere close to getting our drinks; three glasses of wine (We wanted to have a toast.)  Our server was working on the computer and showed me that our order was complete and sitting on the counter; and that, as soon as he finished what he was doing, he'd bring it out.  I offered to take it out myself, but he told me that was not allowed.

I live across the street from the Music Center.  We were asked if we were attending a show.  We probably should've lied and said, ""Yes"".  Maybe, since we weren't under time pressure, we were the last in line.  It took quite awhile for all of us to get our food too. Read more Food was very tasty but cold. Would‚Äôve tasted much better if it was heated up more. We would‚Äôve said something, but we were going to a show at the Ahmanson and didn‚Äôt have time to wait to have the food reheated. Read more Outstanding experience. Food was Delicious! Service excellent!  Very convenient for Ahmanson. Loved the pork chop. Wife liked her chicken as well. Would definitely return. Biggest problem is changes in chef that are regularly scheduled.  My husband and I arrived on time for our reservation.  My child and date had trouble with traffic and train into LA. Nadia our server was efficient and made sure we all were served and ate and still made our 8 pm show.  Food and service excellent. Read more Read more Had a great meal, and a great evening. My only complaint is that the lowest tip that automatically showed up online was 22%. Yes, it could be changed, but I find that so wrong.  Limited menu. Limited wine list. Food fine service excellent.  Abernethy's is always an enjoyable time! They were able to accommodate my last-minute addition to my reservation, the staff was very attentive, the food was delicious and all in all, we had a wonderful time! Can't wait for our next visit back! Read more Everything we had was wonderful. The waiter gave us fantastic recommendations and the atmosphere was just beautiful.  Great place to eat before a show at the Ahmanson/Taper. They make an effort to ensure you're done in time for the show, food and service is always great.  The menu is a bit limited but it changes frequently due to the rotating chefs. Read more The food was bland‚Ä¶ like you had wedding dinner experience.. not disgusting and eligible. The cornbread was dry..over baked. The chicken was uneventful and the short ribs and mashed potatoes had no flavor. The only redeeming factor was the smoked Mac and cheese. Nice atmosphere and drinks. Conveniently located near theaters. Read more We sat outside.  It was pleasant and not too noisy.  The food and drinks were good not great.  Enjoyed dinner and theater to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday. Everything was delicious. We had the corn bread and deviled eggs to start. Loved the honey butter.

I had the salmon which was delicious. Loved how the yogurt provided a nice contrast to the flavor. My husband had the catfish and my son the short ribs. Both said they loved their meals.

We shared a flourless chocolate cake. Rich dark chocolate and caramel. So good.

I had noted on the reservation that it was my son‚Äôs birthday so it was a little odd that they did not acknowledge that. Read more The food is Southern style and tasty.

Read more We decided to try this restaurant to use our Open Table points valued at $25 here. When we arrived we found it to be on the expensive side, but that was okay, because it would be amortized by the $25 credit. The food was not great (all bland flavored and oddly crunchy as if undercooked), but it was a cute place for summer dining and we figured you win some, you lose some -- it was worth a try. But then when it came time to pay, the systems were down and they could not accept our $25. Of course, we tipped the full 20% because it was not our server's fault, but we were not happy - for 3 small dishes (stuffed peppers, ravioli caprese, and english pea risotto) it was $70, plus tax and tip cost us over $90! Crazy, and very disappointing. Read more Once you see an umbrella outside, that's the place. It was a hot summer day where I thought being in the patio would still be hot to eat comfortably but it was nice because they had plenty of trees with shade.

However, when I pointed out the wrong dish charge, they tried to dismiss it by saying the actual order was the same price (it wasn‚Äôt).

The food was very good. We started with the bruschetta which was new to the menu. Really enjoyed it and the bread for it tasted fresh.

I had the linguini with clams (can‚Äôt remember what the name on menu is) and it was very good, just a tad on spicy side for me.

Read more Great environment great service great food quality  Great food and atmosphere. We went for a birthday celebration for my niece. The dessert they gave her was awesome. Wait staff are all excellent.  $200 for dry meats, skimpy salad bar offerings, wilted salad greens, a parade of sirloin and little else, and forgetful staff. I‚Äôll be looking for a new churrascararia. Never again.  The servers were amazing but the food was mid, very overhyped  We always come here for special occasions but it keeps on getting a lot worse! I love love this place and it serves as our go-to spot for celebrations. I'm just getting more disappointed every time.

It took so much time after being seated for a server to come to us. We help ourselves to the market table before anyone else comes to talk to us because we waited so much time.

There was only one gaucho. We came at 1:30. Not too late for a lunch service. Good to say that we did not get the full experience of the meat coz it took a lot of time for the gaucho to come out. It's like one meat every 10-15 mins - of course the fact that you won't get all of the meats being served. No one offered about the live brunch service. Also, I hope the pepper bacon has a heat lamp coz the grease already started to build after it being cold. Read more The meat definitely was dry and overcooked.

I went to their location at home (chicago) and experienced the same thing. I thought it was relegated to home but I think it‚Äôs just overall since now I‚Äôve had the same experience in L.A.  The way they cook all of their meats is average.

Would want to sit outside  We absolutely loved our meal! We did the tasting menu & enjoyed ourselves so much. Great service too!  Always a lovely  experience. Great food, ambiance and service.  Music too loud. Otherwise meal was excellent. Always a delightful experience.  Overall, Terra was an okay experience... I found it impossible to speak with an actual human prior to our reservation - so my dining questions went unanswered until attending... The space is very nice, and the ambience was on point - minus the influencers at a neighboring table snapping photos of themselves and their food ad nauseam... The food and drinks were definitely the highlight of our evening... Though, $85 dollars for a 10 to 12 oz. Bone-In Ribeye was definitely disappointing... The staff was very friendly and the service was mostly great, however, I found it cumbersome to use a small gift card toward our hefty bill when the check came... I literally had to schlepp down two floors, and walk through all of Eataly, to reach Guest Services to quickly transform the gift code into an actual gift card. (This task would have been avoided had I been able to speak with a host prior to our dinner.) Then, schlepp all the way back, and unfortunately slipped and fell in a puddle of water near the elevator. Thankfully, I'm athletic and was not hurt... Oh, and when I returned I noticed that there was an item on our bill that we never received, some mushrooms, but at this point I just wanted to leave, frustrated as I was, as it was my Wife's Birthday and we had plans post dinner... At this price point, I hoped for A LOT more. I mean, maybe parking validation after a $400 meal all in?... I highly doubt we'll return. Read more I often find the food at nice restaurants in LA to be lackluster and not worth the money, prioritizing looks and ambiance over food and value. However, I found Terra to be well worth the meal and filling as well. We ordered the roasted meats for the table and it came with a number of grilled meats that had a nice charred taste owing to the wood-fire, and the seafood appetizer was light and refreshing.

My only complaint was there was no acknowledgment of our anniversary which was mentioned a few times during the booking  We used to like this restaurant but the prices keep getting higher and the food was not so great. We ordered a few dishes - the wagyu skewers for 36 dollars were 2 1‚Äù pieces of meat. It was ridiculous. Anyway we won‚Äôt be back. Read more Some of the food wasn‚Äôt properly cooked. Beautiful ambiance but expensive for the quality of food.  We were 4 people dining in. Two of us wanted the tasting menu which is priced per person and required  for minimum 2 people which was great. The couple that was worth us wanted to eat something else. They did not let us do that, they said everyone at the table had to order the tasting menu. I didn't find this logic at all, didn't understand why, since it is priced per person, and the other couple is ordering food, why we were not allowed to do that is beyond me. We ended ordering the Tuna, it barely comes with a bit of fris√© lettuce& cherry tomatoes, and my husband ordered the branzino that doesn't come with anything. Will not go back. Read more Good food. Great brunch atmosphere. Service is was okay, but we got a tasting menu so not as much attention may be needed? But enjoyed what we got.  Food overall was quite good - specifically focaccia, ragu pasta and pork skewer.  Shrimp skewer was just ok.  Drinks were fantastic and server was great.  DJ/music was fun too.

I‚Äôve been to Eataly twice for brunch and I just went for dinner and OMG the food/drinks is excellent. 100/100  What a disappointment. We had the tasting menu which seemed like a safe choice. The grilled peaches were rock hard. The ravioli was cold. The service was non-existent. We couldn‚Äôt even get water refills and our small table for two was littered with plates because nothing was cleared. When the hostess checked on us and we said the experience was very underwhelming she seemed not at all surprised, sadly. They comped us a dessert which we the only good thing about the meal. But even after remarking on the poor experience the staff was still inattentive and we couldn‚Äôt even get fresh water. It took 30 minutes to get the check. I cannot recommend this restaurant at all. Too bad this is where we opted to go for our wedding anniversary dinner. $250 for nothing but a long night of disappointment after disappointment. Not at all what I‚Äôd expect from Eataly.

It was a LOT of food, we wound up taking some of almost every course to go. Peaches and Burrata salad, Mozzarella and Prosciutto, Mushrooms from the wood fired oven, Grilled Bread and Butter, Zucchini Squash Blossom Ravioli (we ate all of that dish, lol), and a whole grilled branzino with roasted potatoes. We started with a round of cocktails, the Sicario (a modern take on the Old Fashioned with Mescal) was delicious, we got a bottle of Italian Gamay which paired very well with the food on the tasting menu.

I enjoyed my experience at Camelia. I wish there was a way to clarify if you wanted an indoor/outdoor table at time of booking but happy that I was able to snag a table reservation to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday. When we arrived, they had a table outside but neither of us brought jackets and the table was not near a heat lamp. I asked the hostess if she would be able to seat us inside instead. She said there‚Äôs a few tables waiting to clear up so if we didn‚Äôt mind waiting, she could put us inside. There‚Äôs a small waiting section inside towards the restroom so we waited there. We were seated shortly after and our waitress knew that it was a birthday (I put the note in our reservation) and came over and asked whose birthday we were celebrating and started us off with a complimentary small glass of bubbly. The table was by the front near the entrance so it was still a little chilly but better than being outside. The table was also really close to the table next to us and we were able to hear the whole conversation. But we got to see the kitchen which I loved!

I heard the cocktails were good so I ordered a milk punch which was in fact really good. For food, we got the black sesame Parker rolls with the house-cured ikura, the uni otoro toast, the chicken liver mousse toast, the celebrity tomatoes with burrata, the scallops, the beef cheeks and the sweet potato gratin. Everything was really good and I was pleased with everything we ordered. It was definitely too much food for 2 people but that‚Äôs ok because the food was amazing. I couldn‚Äôt pass on dessert since it was my friend‚Äôs birthday so we ordered the rum caramel pudding which they put a candle on for us. The pudding was soft and jiggly, not too sweet which paired nicely with the sweet rum caramel, light and fluffy whipped cream and nutty toasted topping. I loved the fresh figs it comes with too.

The duck dish was the best I can ever remember tasting, as it was moist, flavorful, smooth, and plentiful.  Also nice that the noise level was low, and we did enjoy the 80's 90's music.  We were not rushed, nor felt rushed.  A great experience for someone who has dinned in many Michelin 3-star restaurants all over the world.  Glad to have a really great place to go to here in LA.

Great ambiance and friendly service.  A Stellar Venue for a Board Meeting and Dinner

We recently held a board meeting at Fleming‚Äôs, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. Our group, originally set for 10, grew to 12, and the staff accommodated us effortlessly. We were seated in a private room, perfectly removed from the main dining area, allowing us to conduct our meeting in a peaceful and focused environment.

As we waited for everyone to arrive, drinks were promptly served, with the Old Fashioned being the top choice among us‚Äîand it did not disappoint. Once settled, we opted for appetizers: the calamari and pork belly. Both were absolutely delicious, and I would highly recommend trying them.

For our main courses, each member of our party selected a different cut of meat, and every dish was met with enthusiastic approval. The family-style sides‚Äîmashed potatoes, fried potatoes, and chipotle mac n‚Äô cheese‚Äîwere equally impressive and complemented our meals perfectly.

Dessert was a must, and the strawberry pie, cheesecake, and carrot cake were all hits. Every bite was a delightful end to a wonderful evening.

The staff was professional, efficient, and incredibly friendly, contributing to the overall excellence of the evening. Fleming‚Äôs is an ideal choice for anyone looking to host a business dinner or special event. I highly recommend it! Read more Nice place. We went for lunch. The cocktails are definitely not worth it. The small glass is all ice and 1/8 drink. The meat selection is good for carnivores or those on a keto diet.

Chef Nao Sugiama, Thank you for the wonderful experience.  We had four people in our party.  Three fixed price menu, one premium sushi, and 4 ala carte items.   Food was okay at best...Nothing unique.  Our server was attentive, but there are lots of restaurants that are much better in this price range.  Unfortunately, we don't think we will go back again. Read more We indulged in a variety of appetizers and happy hour specials, along with selection of sushi rolls, all of which were delightfully delicious. The service was exceptional, further enhancing our dining experience. This place is our go-to spot for sushi. Read more Excellent sushi. High-grade. I was there very early before a show so unsure what the noise level or atmosphere is during a normal dinner hour.  Service was excellent. But, we were expecting more variety based on menus posted. Menu is limited now so we had to order a pre-fixe. Prices high, but good quality.  I came to Umaya specifically to dine at the counter and chat with Chef Nao Sugiyama, who had his eponymous restaurant in midtown Manhattan for over 20 years. His Kaiseki menu at Umaya includes some of my favorite dishes at his NY restaurant and new offerings as well.  Chef Sugiyama created some special dishes for my dining experience as it‚Äôs been nine years since we last saw one another.

The sashimi course was as beautiful and fresh tasting as I remembered.  My all-time favorite continues to be the grilled lobster with uni.  A surprise  course was the hairy crab done three ways - divine!   And the waygu beef on hot stone with mushrooms and scallion was melt in your mouth.   I also had a clam and tofu skin soup that was clear, comforting and full of delicious flavor.  As before, his grapefruit dessert is so light and refreshing.
Ask the staff the best sake and red wine to compliment the Kaiseki meal.   They are so knowledgeable.
Now that I have found Chef Sugiyama again, I will be back for more memorable culinary experiences. Read more It was great service and food. Recommend the Omakase.  Great staff, great food, great ambience! Their prix fixe dining options were balanced and rich with flavor, but well priced. Would highly recommend the octopus as well.  Read more What can i say the price is GOOD AND THE FOOD IS PHENOMENAL  Made a reservation and we seated as soon as we got there. We did the dinner and we didn‚Äôt do a fixed menu. We just ordered all the cart. Tried the octopus vinaigrette, four cocktails and one of their sushi boards where they bring you 12 different types of fish about two pieces each of each type of fish, and then seaweed and rice to make your own hand rolls. They bring a little plate with six different types of salt and other tiny fixings. a salad and we had miso soup. All the food was perfect. The food is delicious. The fish was so tasty,.

The service was fantastic. There was no issue at all with the service. Everyone is very kind there and they help each other out so there are no blind Spots in the way they manage their restaurant.

It‚Äôs very quiet and peaceful. There is some music but the music is very low melodic practically elevator music, but better sounding. This is not the right place for a date if you don‚Äôt know that person very well. They have valet.

The cocktails were delicious. We try to cucumber drink, a lychee drink, a mescal drink that I don‚Äôt recall the name of, and another drink that I don‚Äôt remember. The point is, for me to have tried four of the eight cocktails and they were all delicious, means something to me because I love cocktails and I care a lot about a place that is presenting with cocktails. So this is definitely a place where you don‚Äôt have to just stick the beer. Usually when I go to sushi I only stick to beer. But this place has a great cocktail menu.
Ôøº
We also got an opportunity to try dessert which is really good too.

I will mention that this restaurant is a tiny bit pricey when it comes to the sushi, however, the quality is very good for what you are getting. If you want good sushi and you‚Äôre willing to pay about 20 to 25% more for everything, this is your place.  The cocktails are fairly priced. In fact they could be priced higher for how good they are. But the sushi is pricey.Ôøº

We will definitely be coming back here. Read more My party of 4 had a blast at Umaya LA! We came on a late Saturday evening and had a reservation on Open Table (they require a $15 per person deposit when reserving; this deposit goes toward your final bill). We attempted to call the restaurant but was unable to get a representative on the phone, but understandably they are probably very busy! We drove to the restaurant anyway and KTown always has difficult parking, but luckily Umaya has a valet service (we were very happy with this especially with the rain)! The valet were respectful and courteous and handled the car well. Right as we were parking, we actually got a call from the manager of Umaya and he was very very kind to still accommodate our reservation despite being very late. We were seated promptly and the server was very kind, patient, and attentive.

We loved the ambiance of the place. The music was great, the decor was beautiful and really set a dim, chill atmosphere. Most of us ordered from the omakase menu (Tsuki to be exact), and we all really enjoyed not only the service of the omakase, but the taste of each dish was incredible with high quality, fresh fish and the presentation was beautiful! There were 3-4 sushi chefs working so the service was quick! We were always eating which was appreciated as it was a late dinner. I will definitely come back to try another omakase menu item or even their lunch omakase, which looks fun! Read more Best experience in a long time. Chef Nao served us a six course meal that did not disappoint. Terrific value for the amount of food. Excellent service!

Can't wait to go back for more! Read more Had the five course meal, and it was wonderful. The saizuke course of seasonal appetizers was a fun New Year‚Äôs assortment and went very well with a recommended sake. The hot stone course was excellent; not only the beef but also the mushrooms and onions were very flavorful. Rice with dried shiso seasoning, soup and pickles were a great way to finish off the meal.

Read more The acoustics in the room are really bad, and the noise mostly from the happy hour at the bar just creates a loud din throughout the restaurant.  Probably reflecting off the unfinished ceiling.  That industrial look is popular, but every place i've been to has had horrible acoustics from that type of (non) ceiling.

There's also quite a bit of noise from the open kitchen, which maybe could be tolerable if you could actually see what they were doing in the kitchen, for those people interested in that. I could get a glimpse of some impressive looking flames when I stoof up.   But can't really see anything seated at a table except the cooks' heads, and you hear all the pots and pans banging.

I don't know if they were playing background music.But I couldn't hear it, which actually is good.
In many restaurants  the background music is not background music.

It's always far too loud, which wouldn't be bad if I could pick out my music.

The food was very good. We ordered a simple salad to share to start out. And then when the chicken came that I ordered, they have the exact same greens and salad dressing on top of the chicken.  Would not have ordered the salad if I had known that.  I felt the server should have said something

Like ""to be honest, the chicken comes with a pretty good size serving of that same salad""

The pasta that my wife ordered was also a pretty small serving.  Come on pasta is not that expensive. Read more Wine was a bit overpriced. The calamari appetizer, which was gluten-free was really good especially since I am gluten intolerant. The pasta with tomato sauce was OK. The sauce was a little thin. The ambience was fine.

Two of our plates took way too long and it wasn't really that busy. We barely received any attention, so we had to ask for more water and to even to get the check. There are so many other restaurants in LA and Orange County that bring their A-game; Cabra isn't one of them. EXTREMELY overpriced & overrated for such poor service. Read more Booked a table a week in advance and upon arrival they tried to seat us in the bar area in lounge style seating that was utterly inappropriate for dinner. After the host refused to seat us elsewhere, the manager finally agreed to move our table. Our server, while polite, didn‚Äôt even come to our table for 20 minutes, and when he did he took our order but neglected to put our drinks in so all our food arrived first.

For a restaurant of this supposed caliber, it was a very disappointing experience. Probably won‚Äôt be back, unfortunately.

Will def come back for more.  The small portions did shock be but they were very filling and tasty!!

Read more One of the best brunches I‚Äôve been to in LA and I‚Äôve been to a lot! Food, drinks and service are all incredible  Exceptional recommendations by our waiter.  The food was delicious!  I enjoyed the mocktail with purple corn, cinnamon, apple, cloves, and soda.  You can add pisco for the alcohol version.  Spectacular!  We went with the waiter‚Äôs recommendations including the hot cheese dish, bass ceviche, tuna and tater tots, and the grilled brisket. All were excellent, but the standouts were the tuna tots and the cheese appetizer with plantains and hot bread.  I cannot say enough about these two dishes.  We practically licked the plates clean.  How often do you find yourself protective of the waitstaff taking away a dish?  We were so protective of enjoying every morsel of the cheese appetizer, that we transferred the remaining bits to our respective plates.  My only complaint was the excessive time it took the kitchen to make the dishes from the time we ordered them.  If you are in a hurry, don‚Äôt go here.

We really enjoyed ourselves and our first visit to Cabra. Pork shank was amazing! Beautiful view of the downtown skyline from this lovely rooftop perch. We will definitely be back, but not before we try the owner‚Äôs other close by restaurant, Girl and the Goat. Thanks Miguel and Cabral!! Read more Cabra has good Peruvian food and drinks.  I particularly loved the Tuna & Tots, but the Salmon Ceviche and Beef empanadas are great too!  The rooftop offers great views of the city in a relaxing environment.
Given the cost of the restaurant, the service delivered should be WAY better.  It was bad service!  For starters, I hate it when a restaurant has ordering rules.  If I am paying $150/person minimum, I better be able to order how I want, when I want.  There is no need to put in all of my order at once, especially if the restaurant is not busy.  Secondly, a warm greeting and half smile would be expected from the server.  Our server did not crack a smile the whole night and almost seemed bothered by having to serve us, despite not being busy at all.  Finally, the price/quality of the food was not appropriate.  It is way too expensive for what it was.
It's unfortunate, because this place has potential, but I don't think it's worth it. Read more Food was delicious, ambience & view spectacular! Overall great experience will definitely be back & recommend!  First, a caveat: I had booked outdoor seating to take advantage of rooftop views, but they didn‚Äôt have any chairs that were comfortable for my partner (he is a big, tall person). We felt like Goldilocks, with everyone watching as we went from space to space with no luck. Whoever selects seating should consider people with bigger bodies, as that was a negative way to start the evening.

We had to move across into the indoor area, which was beautiful. Once the meal actually started, it went smoothly - service was great, the  dishes were fantastic, and the cocktails were memorable. The salmon skewers, ceviches, and papas huancaina were stand-outs and we would go back to eat those again!

Service has usually been horrible, I mean like stupid horrible, but it‚Äôs convenient so we come back. Oddly enough I was served by someone who was training‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not a great endorsement of the servers here. I‚Äôve also stayed at this hotel and had no service on the club level floor, like we got up and left after the bartender never came over to us, room had two- three people in it and two employees at the bar side. Food is great, it seems like they are working some kinks out that we experienced on both of our first two visits, it‚Äôs a small menu so you can‚Äôt really have multiple items unavailable. First two visits were brunch, like opening time reservations. Read more Beautiful location with amazing views, walking distance from pantages. Waited a bit before being greeted at our table, then our server rushed us through our orders (literally walking away as we were still mid-sentence). It startled to get busy about 30 min after our arrival and then we noticed larger groups that came after us were getting served their dinner before our very basic appetizer even arrived. We had to ask someone to find our server and when she eventually came by she pushed it off to ‚Äúwell, we‚Äôre busy. Lots of people here before the show.‚Äù Our appetizers final came out, with our dinner soon after. Salmon was overcooked and sides were charred to the point of being inedible. We had been sitting at the table for about an hour by the time our food arrived, so we didn‚Äôt have time to have it remade. Ended up having to share a meal so we could make it to our show in time. Was disappointed that we were able to get help from several other servers when our server was never around or could care less when she was. With the right person caring for you I‚Äôm sure this place would be an amazing experience, but we unfortunately didn‚Äôt have that this time. Read more The ambiance and proximity to the Pantages Theater cannot be beat! They offer $20 parking if you dine in and you can leave your car there while taking in the show. There were a few things on the menu that were just ok, like the roasted cauliflower main (unusual flavors that didn‚Äôt really mix well) and the crispy Brussels sprouts appetizer (too burnt). However the Dinosaur Kale salad was excellent!! I would like to return soon to try different items on the menu.
Overall, I highly recommend this place as it is a really nice rooftop restaurant and bar. Read more Read more Beautiful atmosphere.
The host was not welcoming, nor was he communicative.  Aloof and dismissive, despite us having a reservation with a birthday request.  He kept walking away without telling us to follow or not follow.  Did not make eye contact.
Service was dreadful.  We began with one server who was lovely and then another server (who was neglectful) took over.  Server one seemed baffled by being usurped.  
Server 2 was consumed with attending a couple of other tables who seemed to be drinking a great deal.
Over 30 minutes went by without being checked on.  When he finally checked on us at the end of the meal (having not seen him since the appetizers arrived) we were told we could not order dessert because the kitchen was closed.  It was my dear friend's birthday and we were obviously hoping for dessert.  When my friend complained, he went and checked with the kitchen and they gave permission to accept a dessert order.  He gave us the menu and then HOVERED over our table as we discussed and decided.   We quickly ordered and he left, only to return a few minutes later to tell us they were out of the dessert we ordered.  Once again, he HOVERED while we had to hastily make another choice.  
The starters were delicious and inventive:  Carrots, Potatoes, Hummus and Broccolini.
Our Main Dishes were sub par : Cacio E Pepe - SMOTHERED in sauce, Hollywood Bowl Salad which was tasteless and seemingly not fresh, and the macaroni and cheese which was tepid and had no texture/crispiness atop.
The cheesecake we ended up with had burnt bits and tasted strongly of egg.  The unidentifiable berry sauce seemed like something the kitchen threw on at the end of the night when they couldn't be bothered to actually finish out service.

Food- Delicious

Ambiance - Fantastic Read more Great experience.  We really enjoyed our evening.  Loved it- great views, great food, great service. I‚Äôll be back.  My first experience at Lemon Grove, a few months ago, was absolutely wonderful. I was so excited to take my mother here! But this second trip, comparatively, was a disappointment. 

The host was unable to seat us outside despite asking in advance and plenty of tables being available. This I understood-- maybe those tables were on hold for someone else! But our seat, right next to the waiter's stand inside, was constantly being jostled by staff. The lighting was off, and our waitress wasn't knowledgable about the menu or the wine. And perhaps the menu had changed since I visited last year-- but the food was far more disappointing, the portion on the salmon extremely small, the sauce on the carrots almost flavorless. A bit bummed-- I'll probably only come back from drinks at the bar, considering the let down that was the dining experience this time around.

I've been to many bars and restaurants in LA. But this one by far was the worst Bar I've ever been.

Unhelpful staff.
There is NO FOOD!
MUSIC was disappointing.
LIMITED drinks, slow service.
NO VIEW

The decorations were super outdated .
Nothing matched!  It was like putting some tables and chairs or tent to make it look like a bar.

The music & DJ were supper disappointing and confusing. Random spotify list would be better.

*NOTE* If you want to seat you need to get a table with  $500 Min order.

They just had less than 6 drinks on menu and expensive. On top of that when you asked them to make something simple like Mojito they would say tonight we our out or they didn't know what you asking !

Bring very warm jacket as well it's become super windy.So, it will become supper cold ü•∂.

Music needs improvement. The women‚Äôs bathroom attendant was the best service I received there.  There is no food at Golden Hour! You will need to go to another concept within Level 8 to get food. I am unclear whether or not the food may be brought back into Golden Hour.

Reservations at Golden Hour after 8pm or so are useless. The only thing that matters is whether you would like to get a seating area with minimum requirements. We took a $500 minimum area for our group and while we had a good time here are the challenges:

1. Service is incredibly slow. Even at an area with a dedicated staffmembet/wait service. Might want to consider ordering 2 rounds at once because it takes so long (on a Saturday night).

2. We had guests in our group who left earlier but wanted to contribute to our tab. Unfortunately our waiter was not clear about this and it was not reflected in our tab when we were closing out at the end of the night so we ended up having to pay way over our $500 minimum.

The location is nice and impressive and a great building to visit. So many films have been filmed here. The architecture is very nice and the lobby is beautiful with many water fountains.

As you make your way to the 35 floor, you will be greeted by the receptionist. The city view is very nice and our table seating was also great.

I ordered two steaks, Delmonico 24oz and Prime Rib. I asked for the ideal chef cook for both steaks. One of the steaks served to me practically RAW. I found that to be pretty ridiculous, and all I was offered was to go cook it for two more minutes.

I wanted wine, and I asked for something sweet.  No suggestions were given to me, and the glasses were picked up from our table. Made no sense to do so, but honestly, I did not want to argue.

I lost my appetite due to the piece of RAW meat placed on my plate that I was served. The center still had blood on the top.

It was not all bad, the Garlic mashed potatoes were really good. The Hamachi Crudo was finger licking good. The Caesar Salad was also perfect. Brussels sprouts were delicious and enjoyed every bite.

Roberto saved the night when we went downstairs to the lounge area. The view was simply nice to see on a rotating floor. The desert was also great, and the service here was very nice and attentive.

The reason for my overall score to be low is the fact that the steak needed to be amazing, and it fell short. After all, it is a steak place, and that should have been cooked right the first time around. I am sorry, but the RAW steak really missed the mark. The value was simply not there, I paid for a steak to be nicely prepared for me but instead paid for a raw piece of meat for me to take home and cook it myself. That was not okay at all.

Highly recommend  Absolutely delightful cocktails and delish vegan food. Our non-vegan friends were happy. The lemon cheesecake was amazing! Great service and nice open plant filled ambiance. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Read more Read more Wonderful evening and the food was fantastic. Great service as well!  Great brunch with a friend! Good food and yummy coffee!  That peach salad is so good. I could have it every day.  Our first experience at The Butcher‚Äôs Daughter was very nice. The server was very kind and helpful. The food was delicious and the ambiance was nice. Our only complaint, and it‚Äôs not really a complaint is that we arrived a couple minutes before 6pm and we were not offered the Happy Hour price. We asked and the server said it just ended. Then they were out of a certain beer and it would have been very thoughtful to offer the Happy Hour price after this. Oh well, not a big problem and we will return again, but maybe 10 minutes to 6 instead of 2. üòú Read more a little bite long after we have order our drinks but very nice experience after have already try locations in NYC  Gteat food, great service, fair prices. Noise level a bit loud but not obnoxious. I didn‚Äôt appreciate the 3 dogs that landed at my feet, but otherwise I will definitely be back.  One of the best vegetarian restaurants in the world!

Read more Ingredients were top notch and designed with great creativity and balance.  Love the summer menu.  Amazing food, atmosphere and service! Will definitely be here again.  We love this restaurant, everything about it. I don‚Äôt know if they have music on only certain nights or not, but the accomplished musicians were good  to listen to, but a tad too loud for such a small space.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm very much a senior, but it was hard to hold a conversation.  It‚Äôs a ‚Äúhang-loose‚Äù vegan restaurant with a cool vibe and outstanding food selections. Read more Read more Server showed up very soon after we sat down and when we weren‚Äôt ready to order she disappeared for an exceptionally long time.  Food was ok, space is cute but service not good.  When she brought us the bill it wasn‚Äôt printout verify it was correct the server just showed an amount on her handheld device and asked for a card.  $115 before tip for 2 people for lunch.  No plans to go back. Read more Great spot to have breakfast.

Everything is healthy, but not boring.  The service was extremely disappointing, and the food quality was below average. It was also significantly overpriced. We ordered the burrata, which was a very small portion, and the pizza was just dough and tomato. The margarita was the worst I have ever had. Additionally, the chips that came with the veggie burger were terrible, and the burger itself was the worst veggie burger I have ever tried. Given this terrible experience, I will not be returning and cannot recommend this place to others. Read more Oily food, terrible ‚Äúlatte‚Äù coffee (not milky at all) and egg sandwich tasted like rubber.  Visited for an early dinner reservation so it wasn‚Äôt very packed ‚Äî great for me!

For drinks, I tend to order on the sweeter side of cocktail offerings, but there wasn‚Äôt a lot of options so I ended up getting the sangria. Still not to my liking but that‚Äôs just a personal preference.

For dinner, i ordered the spicy salad, pad Thai, and kebab. All INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS. The flavors were to die for! I will absolutely be coming back!

Shoutout to the staff ‚Äî they were very kind and attentive Read more The food is always so delicious here. The ambiance is wonderful too.  I had been to the butchers daughter in Venice in the past and it was really good .  It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant the people we friendly but service was a little inattentive .

Been a regular at this fine restaurant for years and the experience has always been pleasant.  Food is great as always. Service on point. Favorite shabu  We had such an amazing experience here. Every course was delicious and they were so kind to show us how to enjoy each one with detailed explanations. We were the last ones in the restaurant and they were so patient and encouraged us to fully enjoy each course with no rush.
Everything from the service to the food was amazing. Will definitely return. Read more Appetizers change more frequently and keep getting better.  Def one of my favorite restaurants in LA! top notch food with excellent service!  Great experience like everyone said amazing service! All my friends said they are going to come back again!  Shabu Shabu at its finest in LA with fresh ingredients and well-balanced appetizer courses.  Read more Always great service and a good meal from start to finish. From appetizers to Shabu Shabu to the soup rice/udon and dessert.  The food is amazing as usual. The service was great! The staff is very attentive and friendly. My favorite is the appetizer and dessert!  Tensho has thoughtful service, high quality food and pleasant atmosphere.  It is a reliable place to visit all the time.  Great experience overall. It gets pricey than before. It was called Kagaya before covid. I was told that owner has changed. As well as the menu changed quite a bit too. At lease they didn‚Äôt charge for a desert before. As a conclusion, if you want a fine finding this is the place. However, if you are short on cash, go somewhere else. Spending over 200 dollar per person is an easy thing to do. Read more Food quality is amazing, service is no doubt. Will be back for sure!  Excellent food and service!  Always very fresh and high quality ingredient and we enjoy eating here  Outstanding. The Best Shabu Shabu experience in Southern California. Don‚Äôt miss it.  Incredible service and beautifully served food. Warm atmosphere, and great selection of Sake.

Great burger & fries
Will be back  The garnish on the drinks were comical and absurd. The tables were uneven and we had tried to share the tartare and the plate was rattling between the tables being taller than the other. The food was under seasoned and uninspired. Very hotel group. Open handed service was not consistent. Dead plates and glassware sat on the table. The desserts were dropped while the entree plates were still on the table and the waitress said it was a birthday surprise for dessert even though the only surprise/ expectation was a candle- we had picked the dessert ourselves. Manager sat on his laptop all evening in the corner and made the energy seem very careless and uninvested in service. Very disappointed, especially as someone who works in hospitality in NY. Read more Service was a little slow, waitress was not very helpful.  I ordered Beef Hash.  It was good but it was too rich - they added cream to a perfectly fine beef that would have been a lot better off without it.  However, all ingredients were top quality fresh.  Cute restaurant to look at, ambience was good.  Parking was very bad, as the locale was in a permit only residential area.  Valet parking cost $15 and all they did was leave my car in the ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù only zone. Restaurant was a little overpriced.  For 2 dishes and one glass of wine we paid $105. Read more This was our first experience at Simonette and we will certainly be returning!  The food, service, and ambience were excellent!  Thank you for a wonderful meal!  Attentiveness: The valet, host, and server all greeted me with a smile, which was a nice touch. While the server didn‚Äôt offer water right away and brought it late, his overall service was very good.

Cleanliness: The restaurant was very clean, though I did notice a bottle of window cleaner hanging off the roof by the front door, which gave a bit of a tacky first impression.

Food Quality: The avocado toast and French toast were surprisingly good. However, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the eggs Benedict, which felt a little too simple for my taste. On the plus side, the latte was excellent.

Ambiance: The atmosphere was beautiful, especially the patio with the tree and plants, which gave it a natural feel. The bar, although small, was nicely positioned in the middle, dividing the patio and main dining area. I also loved the unique decor, particularly the use of guitar amps as speakers‚Äîdefinitely a cool touch that I haven‚Äôt seen before.

Overall: A great first experience, but I do feel the place is a bit overpriced, and the presentation of the dishes could use some improvement. I‚Äôm not sure I would return, but if you‚Äôre in the area, it‚Äôs worth checking out. Read more Service was awful. Food was just okay. I will not be going back l.  Ambience and food are both very good. I give it three stars because the service wasn‚Äôt great and you  have to do valet parking at $15 a person which is insane. It automatically adds so much cost to the overall experience. I felt terrible because one of our guests offered to pick up the valet tab and he ended up being out $60 which I don‚Äôt think he was expecting. We had a 7 o‚Äôclock reservation and we weren‚Äôt sat until 720. Read more Love the happy hour. The service is amazing. I love the servers there. Bring back moules frites! Or include on HH menu PLS  The vibe was easy going, the Monday All Day Hour is awesome. $10 burgers, which are awesome BTW, makes this place a definite repeat for Monday burgers for the whole family. The food was good to great depending on what you order. Stick with the basics and you'll save some money. Read more Read more We ate hamburgers during happy hour.  They were ok, but at $10 a little side salad or small order of fries should have been added. Lovely patio.  Friendly, attentive service.

However, the music was too loud so it's hard to have a conversation.  Always a nice experience at Simone‚Äôs! Great staff and exceptional ambiance!  Clearly short staffed. We went on a Sunday, had a reservation and waited to be seated for 15 minutes. Waited other 15 to other our drinks (which was water) and received them in the middle of eating.

See you soon.  Took a large party for post event drinks and appetizers. The cocktails were great but the selection of appetizers as well as the presentation and quality were very odd.

Service was great and food was good from appetizer to the main dishes  Food and service was wonderful but they asked us to leave our table when we hadn‚Äôt even been there for an hour yet.

Read more My entree‚Äîthe taco trio‚Äîwas excellent and I enjoyed the atmosphere.  The service was polite and friendly.  However, I was in disbelief when I ordered a glass of wine ($16 for a California red) and received what can only be called a stingy pour.  The server later confirmed it was 4 oz but even that is stretching it based on the small size of the glass.  It was a nice wine and I might have ordered a second glass had I not felt so ripped off by the first.  The beverage director should really reconsider whether they want to deviate from the industry standard 5 oz. Read more This was not at all what I was expecting.  It‚Äôs all outside and the tables are plastic.  The chairs are terrible.  Everything is very dirty.  We waited nearly 10 minutes to get seated and there were very few people at the venue.  Our waitress was nice. And the food was average.  Not worth $142 I spent for dinner for 2 of us. Read more We were surprised how empty it was, as we actually did not need a reservation to be seated immediately. We looked up the place ahead of time and what we found online was that there was a set brunch menu with a starter, a main dish, a dessert and a mimosa. That was no longer included on the current menu.

We ordered steak and it was absolutely delicious.  My wife had it with the corn and it was amazing.  No doubt we would return just for the food.  We ordered the champagne with the mimosa flight and again, it was spot on.

The view was nice and overall it was a great experience. Read more It was a beautiful view, and the food was amazing.  Good experience. Service was good and so was the food. Taking a reservation for 5 people at 8pm when the restaurant closes at 9 is not cool though. Serving appetizers and main courses at the same time (the plates did not even fit the table) is not good. Also having security ask us to leave while food is still being consumed is not what I would expect from a classy customer-centric establishment. Read more Amazing guys in the Service and Kitchen!

If you enjoy Japanese food, you won't be disappointed here! Read more We came to Eigikutei to celebrate a recent event with their Vegan Kaiseki set menu.

Everyone working was kind and before I ask for something, they had already brought it to me. The attentiveness of all the staff was evident. And Chef Minou's food was outstanding. I can say it was the best Japanese dishes I've ever had. It was one of the most satisfying dinners I've had in recent years. I will definitely go again soon. It's the best! Read more We had the plant based Kaseiki Tasting Menu.  It was amazing!  Everything was delicious.  I am still dreaming of the deliciousness.  The service was attentive and excellent.  We will be back. Read more I was underwhelmed by our dinner. First of all, this place is expensive, so I had big expectations.  The sushi was not as fresh as I expected it to be, and the appetizers were okay. We spent over $700 for dinner, and I was not impressed. Dinner was just  okay, so I will not be coming back. Read more Great business dinner experience!  Thanks for having us again!  AMAZING SERVICE for a special evening. Food quality is high and therefore price is high (but fair). Don't expect AYCE hotpot price point.  We got the vegan tasting menu and every bite was exceptional. Each course was well thought out and balanced, and each bite was bursting with unique and complimentary flavors. I am not a vegan, but this meal did not make me miss meat in any way. The menu celebrated Japanese flavors exceptionally well, the service was impeccable, the restaurant decor was very minimalistic and clean. I felt like I was transported back to Japan for an evening, thank you so very much! Read more The vegan hot pot was incredibly delicious.

Great food awesome service music dance üëåüèº Read more The ambience and performances were top notch, especially the dancers.

One of the best dinning and entertainment at the same time. Can‚Äôt wait to go back soon  Talk about service!
I don‚Äôt know if they think they can just say anything and people believe it. But someone that comes from customer service, and has eye balls. You can tell, this girl only wants to help the big groups.

It was my wife‚Äôs birthday!
She Order  gin wifh cucumber. Server Claudia said she will make it happen. Nice!
Got nothing she ordered. Was told they had to go get cucumber from another kitchen. When a cup of cucumber are sitting on the bar. And they have a drink with the same ingredient. By the way! My wife pointed that out to the server Claudia. ÔøºAnd she just walked away!

We ordered sides with the steak. Did not get what we ordered. We eat, and a side of veggies came out!? We asked for mushrooms. And we finish eating when it was out. Claudia said she did not hear the order! Really? Because when you pulled out your tablet it said mushrooms on  it!

If the server just said sorry, I made a mistake it would have been ok. Stuff happens. But don‚Äôt make things up , and expect people to go with it. No one likes a Pinocchio make Sh‚Ä¶ up!

I had better conversation with the bus-boy  and the restroom attendant. My wife said the same thing. Talk about service.

They are lucky the music and everything else was good. But if a server is going to make up anything, make sure the guest can‚Äôt see the BS.  Best of luck! Will not be back. Music is not worth it!
She is lucky for the 22% of service charge. My wife would left her a cucumber for a tip. Read more Read more Place is very nice.  Very typical of a Persian/Srmenian restaurant wherein you dine and there‚Äôs entertainment.  They limit your dinner to 2 hours only.  Parking is hard and expensive.

They automatically charge you 22% Gratuity Read more Nice experience would like to see all performances in 1 sitting  Too many extra charges. Service was good and food was good but very overpriced  The ambience was an amazing start to our girls night. The food was good and cocktails were strong. The entertainment that was provided was the perfect touch.  Amazing place! Celebrated my husbands birthday and he had such a great time!  The shows and ambiance was very nice, the food was not worth the money and overpriced, I ordered a wagyu Japanese steak $34 an oz and ordered 6 oz and received a plate full of fat, I ordered medium well and the first time it was brought out was ALL pink, very rare. The server was suppose to address it and only came back to the table with the bill. I dined there in celebration of my husband birthday which was never acknowledged, we are from Houston and definitely would not recommend or dine there again. My bill was $630 and we left there still hungry and went and dined at Fixin‚Äôs downtown since it was so late and  that restaurant was still open where we received GREAT service and food, my bill was $150 and I left there happy and full. Read more When  making the reservation on Open Table I marked it was for a special occasion, a birthday. Also, while at the restaurant we informed ever worker we came in contact with it was my friend‚Äôs birthday. During the whole experience their was no special acknowledgment. I have never celebrated at a restaurant and they not make some acknowledgment of a person‚Äôs birthday, this really lowered the experience.""

Great food, great service, and amazing shows every 30 mins  Had the best time, sat on the lower level and got to see the prettiest dancers  Read more The energy was great and the performers were entertaining. I would expect the $200 tomahawk to be better quality for the price and the service to be better for $400+ dinner. It was good, just not great. I would give them a second chance. It‚Äôs definitely better to go later than earlier. Read more It's so clearly a cash grab you can't enjoy it.  You start by being told you have a time limit on the table and are reminded of it constantly.  It's very expensive for what you get and every moment an upsell, like bottle service is being pushed.  The food was awful and the bill as IMMENSE. Read more One of the best experiences of my life. We came for a bachelorette party. The manager, servers, dancers were so nice and took great care of us.

Definitely recommend it  Fun experience, good food. $400 for 2 people and they ask you to leave after 2 hours. Select who you take wisely.  Shows were to short.

Nice time with my sister in law  Very cute restaurant. Staff was very accommodating for the cooler weather as well. Food was great as well as service.  The restaurant was not properly air conditioned.  It was a very hot evening and we were uncomfortable throughout the whole meal, because the air conditioning was not good.  Also, the entrance to the restaurant has an open doorway with no screen or anything.  It was letting in a ton of flies while we were eating.  The flies were swarming around our food and we couldn't enjoy it.  It was awful.  Also, the quality of the cuisine was just so-so.  I did not find the food all that tasty.  No one in the party thought their meal was particularly good.  A lot of us ordered pastas of which the tomato sauce tasted like ketchup.  I will not return to this place.

We booked a table for 11:30 pm, drove all the way there just to learn that they are closed.  Basil pesto pasta was delicious.

Not a great start, but we stayed due to being on a time constraint.  The rest of the experience was fine - decent food, okay service - but not more than fine. Read more Lovely evening with really great food. Service was excellent too  DO NOT GO HERE. Worst restaurant experience I have had in a very long time, our server got multiple orders wrong for food and drink. Our party of 9 was basically ignored the whole night we had to get up to find a server or bartender to order. It took 20 minutes for 2 drinks to hit our table and the other 5 took 40 MINUTES to get to our table. We ordered the uni pasta which they did not they us they ran out of until some of our entrees were at our table and they also forgot to put in one of our friend's pasta. They brought us out 3 plates at a time so our party didn't even each together. The manager needs to be let go because this place is so horribly mismanaged. The manager ambushed one of the girls of our party when she went to the bathroom letting her know he knew what a bad experience we were having he apologized to her and gave us our table 5 gross cookies to share amongst 9 ppl to say sorry for the horrible service and bad watery hard pasta.

We were seated immediately, outside, and our server was gracious and helpful in recommendations. She made sure we were served in a timely manner and the food was delicious. We decided to share 3 dishes between the 4 of us. Their complementary Bread arrived first with a dipping oil/balsamic, and the bread seemed to be basted with a lovely garlic butter. We ordered their Prosciutto Arugula Pizza, thin crust and everyone really enjoyed it. Their Bolognese Pasta was very good. And the Carbonara Pasta was the big hit, well worth the trip!

The staff were friendly and helpful.  I was sitting near the bar and found they have good selections on wine and spirits.  I ordered a clam chowder soup following with a steak salad.  The soup, served with slices of baguette, is surprisingly excellent.  Salad paired with glasses of red and white.  Having finished the above then I ordered tiramisu with a glass of Glenffidich 15.

NEVER CALLED BACK. Booked through OpenTable & Email Venue. Manager Chris emailed confirming 23 guest was possible on patio by the bar for Dinner&Drinks. DAY of Event, called Resturant to confirm  reservation was updated. Same Man picked up phone from last time. Wasn‚Äôt friendly, asked for my Name & Details, then said I would have to pay a FEE of $100 if we stayed passed 2Hrs. I told him 2Hr to serve & eat wouldn‚Äôt even be enough time and Chris never mentioned this FEE, or hour limit In the email. His Response: ‚ÄúEveryone has to Pay this Fee. Chris is too caught up with everything and doesn‚Äôt know to mention it‚Äù - very unprofessional response. I don‚Äôt mind paying a fee but it didn‚Äôt make sense to me. Too late to cancle so I said ok. Some time later, received another call frm Resturant, different guy, very friendly, said he will prepare our area for us. This call made me feel a bit better.

ARRIVED at 7pm : Valet Parking - But they leave at 10pm - They‚Äôll Drop your keys but you have to pay still. No Hostess, caught a waiteress to bring us to our seats. Ambiance: Okay, Messy in the front w/ all the Boxes where the dessert are. Our Area:The Patio beside the bar was Cute. NO plates were Set, TABLES were all separated. NOTHING was prepared. Asked to move Tables closer. Waiter didn‚Äôt greet, Didn‚Äôt Bring Menu, figured it out ourselves. Food portions were large, good for sharing. Food was actually very good! I want to highlight that, but the service was sooo Bad I can‚Äôt. Left 3HR for another Venue.

Unfortunately, the food fell short of expectations. Despite the exquisite setting, the dishes felt overpriced. It's a pity because with such a stellar ambiance, I had envisioned a dining experience that would tantalize my taste buds as well. On a positive note, the service was excellent; the staff was attentive, friendly, and professional and they truly seemed committed to making the dining experience pleasant.

Service severely lacking for such a great hotel . Being ignored and having to go and find a server to get a coffee refill really is unacceptable! !  Unacceptable service. We sat ignored at our table for 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. To top it off, our food arrived before our drinks, and the server completely disappeared after that. We waited over 30 minutes just to get our check, only to have to track down a manager ourselves. Their idea of compensation? Comping our iced teas.

The restaurant is part of a little plaza that has outdoor parking but the lot is small and got full quick! My only irk is that when we asked for hot sauce, the waiter suggested a housemade jalapeno relish which we chose over Tapatio but then we were charged $3 for it!

We were going to a concert and wanted to have some great food and cocktails before the show. We love Mastros in Newport Beach, so we figured it would be equally awesome with great drinks, good atmosphere, perfect service and good food. NO - didn't happen.  We had a hightop in the bar, which in Newport and BH is awesome. Not here.  It took 25 minutes before anyone came to our table. It then took another 25 minutes before our cocktails arrived. By then we had gotten two out of three appetizers, but was missing the third, which never came. We were just about done with the starters by the time the drinks arrived. My Negroni was just about 60% full. Whattt? I said. For $25, my martini glass should be full, not half empty after one sip. Now over an hour into this sad ordeal we decided that this was not worth it, by any stretch of the imagination. We decided to simply just walk over to Flemings two blocks away. WOW, what a difference. Great service, good drinks, oysters that were served within a few minutes, etc etc. 

Lesson learned. Mastros Oceanclub DTLA is a mediocre experience and is certainly not worth the money or the time. It absolutely sucked and we will never ever go there again. Read more The service was wonderful and the food was great. However, it's too nice, and expensive, to have the music playing so loud. It was difficult to hear each other speak at a four top.

Their half baguette served with butter is still delish but I think they changed their wine by the glass offerings as well.  Had a kind of disappointing pinot.  Seem to remember their having Belle Gloss by the glass.  Server was nice and helpful and the maitre D was very nice and funny.  Why change the menu when you have proven winners?

Great service.. my only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù we went for the ‚ÄúSunday Supper‚Äù but they were out of it at supper time.  Excellent food, exceptional service. Great cocktails. Great vibe.  Unremarkable.  Escartgot was quite difficult to get out do the shell without breaking it.  They don‚Äôt serve vegtables? And it was overpriced for what it is.  Super cool historic venue.  Good food and cocktails, with excellent service.  Host and server were super friendly and helpful.  A wonderful classic Hollywood space, updated but true to its origins.  I figured the food should be pretty good.  Wrong!  The food was really really excellent!!!  A remarkably richly flavored duck breast, among the tenderest I‚Äôve ever had.  I had duck breast the next day at a Michelin-starred restaurant a mile or so to the south, and this was better.  Yes, I like duck.  Creative and beautifully prepared appetizers. Friendly and natural service.

 like fried chicken, french fries, and desserts.  I love Yardbird in Las Vegas, I decided to visit again after 2 years to return to the Beverly center restaurant, all I can say is the service was awful requested from manager to change waiters due to waiting for drinks sitting at bar 20 min appetizers 20 sitting on top with no one bringing over food. They gave us the second waiter who was very polite but it was already disappointing the service.

The service was great and so was the food.  Best fried chicken in Los Angeles. Great ambience and top service.  Such a great experience coming in here.

The manager Tommy stopped by a couple times to check on us and we ended up having a conversation with him which was a nice touch. Overall, we had a great time and will definitely be coming back. Read more The food was good - consistent with Miami and Las Vegas. Service was not good. 1) food allergies were part of the reservation through OpenTable and server did not check. This needs to be standard SOP when they take a table. 2) I asked for ice in a glass three times with the person who was running food from the pass to tables. Eventually I went to the bar myself to ask for a glass with ice. I even walked right by the GM who saw me and did not offer to assist. The bar tender seemed like it was a difficult task to fill a glass of ice. At one point, the GM was dancing as well as the bar tender. Maybe their time should be better served focusing on customers and staying focused on what they are paid to do. Tip was reduced due to lack of good service. Read more As southern food goes it is was ok. It would not make the grade there, the fried chicken is not double battered with a light flaky crust (not nearly as good as Popeye's or Churches), the corn bread is more of a cake texture/like vs corn meal with stronger corn flavor.

The food was amazing as well as the drinks ! Read more Great experience and food was amazing will be back  This may be the worst experience I have had at a restaurant that accepts reservations. Perhaps just for that day, but the service was absolutely dreadful. It was clear that they were short staffed- for about the first 1.5 hrs there were two people bussing tables, taking orders, closing out, cleaning and resetting tables, running food, and making drinks. The guy serving us worked really hard to juggle everything and he can‚Äôt be blamed. The restaurant should have done a better job getting coverage or communicating their tough situation to customers.

The food should NOT be labeled as Jamaican. I am from the Caribbean, have eaten lots of Jamaican food. I was there with my girlfriend and her sister, both Jamaican. The rice and peas was dry, the brown stew chicken tasted like a sweet stew chicken, the jerk chicken was not jerked but had something closer to a miso glaze over chicken, same for the jerk salmon. The curry chicken had something that‚Äôs not supposed to be in curry chicken but I can‚Äôt quite put my tastebuds on it. The only thing I can say is that the fried plantains were enjoyable and the Mac n cheese oxtail starter was also pretty decent. For the prices on the menu, nothing was worth it.

Drinks were too sweet had the passion fruit mule it had too much syrup or whatever flavoring they used  Me and my wife had the valentine special that was $225 didn‚Äôt know until once food was delivered it was one plate to share through out the whole  5 course meal, food was great but was very over priced for the amount gave gratuity was a forced $50 which I would of tipped generously regardless but to be forced to tip $50 after being over charged for food and having to ask multiple times for things I feel this place is very over hyped we walked away spending $371 not close to full I have spent half the price at Ruth Chris and got 3 times the amount of food we was served ‚Ä¶also bought a mango passion and there was NOOO liquor present what so ever ‚Ä¶the service was not the problem it was the over pricing and little servings of everything Read more Unfortunately, this place did not update the address nor phone number via google search.

It it located in Little Tokyo, which is not a popular neighborhood.  When we went on a Saturday night at 7pm, it was empty.

As a Caribbean family, it was not the best, but still was good.  I really liked my curry chicken, but I felt the jerk chicken was too sticky instead of like a rub.  My kids got the jerk chicken and waffles and they really liked the waffles and the chicken.

Thank you,  Melissa!  I am 52 years old old and I look it! So to be refused drink when your age limit is 21 is ridiculous!! Now either I should be flattered that you think I look that young or your member of staff needs glasses. I have travelled all over the world eating at Hard Rock as we love the franchise so much. Recently we went to New York and only a few days ago Las Vegas. On both these occasions I was never challenged on my age because it's obvious that I am old enough. Maybe your staff need to use a little discretion on enforcing your rules as this experience left us feeling humiliated and disappointed. The food itself was the usual amazing quality but the experience of the Los Angeles restaurant was definitely not. Now I always tip and I always buy something from the shop as a nice reminder. On this occasion I left neither of those!! We left and went straight to a bar where we were served alcohol immediately without question. So maybe you need to address your rule enforcement and how your staff deal with these situations as once your server realised we were not happy he never attended to us again,not asking how our food was or offering us our DIET COKE refill ! We are off to Honolulu next and should we go the Hard Rock there we hope we are treated better!

I would definitely come back again. Read more It was a nice little spot, we celebrated a birthday, we had Tony as our waiter, very nice and attentive. Would definitely consider returning for another visit  Food and esthetic were on point. For a night that wasn't crowded, service was really slow.  Five on the Hill in Universal City is an absolute gem! We ordered three different flights‚Äîa wine flight, a margarita flight, and a champagne flight‚Äîand each one was a delight to the palate. The variety and quality were exceptional. For Appetizers, we ordered the apricot baked brie, and the brussels sprout. For dinner, we had the lobster scampi, the carbonara, and the ribeye, and every dish was perfection, both in flavor and presentation.

It‚Äôs the ideal spot for an evening out. Highly recommend this place for a delicious and fun night out! Read more  Beautiful restaurant.  Waitress was great!  She brought the vibes.

This is my third time visiting five on the hill and I can say that every time I've been there I've had a great time. Food is awesome. Drink selection is awesome and the service was awesome. The only thing that they might be able to improve on is it takes a little long to get the food. Read more They were able to accommodate our late arrival due to LA traffic. The restaurant is beautiful. Food is decent enough to go back and try something else, but nobody really cared for what they ordered. 3 of the 4 staff were very nice. Live music was a very nice touch. ALL drinks were delicious. The presentation of the food and drinks were on point. The food just didn't taste good for the most part. I'd still recommend. Read more I saw this restaurant on TikTok and it looks really cool, my fianc√© was very excited to check it out but when we got there, we noticed that it was just a part of the Hilton and it wasn‚Äôt anything that was of any experience that he had.

An extremely underwhelming experience, the amount of money for the amount of food we got, and the quality of the food was just not that great. Her and I have dined at some really high-end restaurants, and even though they were expensive, we still felt like we got an experience for our money and at this restaurant it was just it wasn‚Äôt great at all.

Atmosphere was very calm and relaxed. The food was delicious! I‚Äôll definitely come back the next time I‚Äôm visiting.   Delicious margarita flight.

I ordered the lobster regatta it was OK. Ôøº the bread pudding dessert was delicious. The restaurant is not what I had pictured and had seen on Instagram. There was really no view except of the hotel pool. The restaurant is set up in the parking lot of the hotel kind of odd. Cute decor though. I‚Äôm glad I got to try it. I would never go back and I would not recommend. ÔøºÔøº Read more Overall great food and vibe. It was just really hot out so we decided to cut brunch short and get back to the AC in the room.  The food, music, scenery was great. Will definitely go again when I am back in Cali. Thanks for a wonderful brunch experience!  It's a nice outdoor setting with views of the hills but also unfortunately the freeway down below.  Food is solid but unspectacular, and it's a bit on the pricey side for what it is.  The baklava brie appetizer is outstanding, and my wife very much enjoyed her rib-eye steak.  The short rib pasta was just ok.  Desserts very good.

Incredible food and even better service !  very funky loud restaurant. outside is quieter than inside.  but the inside is very chic with a good looking bar.  our waiter with the handlebar mustache was outstanding and the Argentinian waitress was pleasant and helpful.  even the bus boys pleasant and solicitous.  the food was good not great.  we had the seafood risotto, spicy tuna with crispy rice and spicy tuna roll.  the risotto itself (without the seafood) was very good.  Drinks were ok.  all in all I would go back, but the sushi is better at sugar fish.  but sugarfish doesn't have crispy rice or spicy tuna rolls! Read more Negroni has amazing craft cocktails and the service was excellent, my favorite thing was the warm inviting ambiance with the orange hues from the lighting. A must in Beverly Hills!  Feels like Buenos Aires. Delicious barrata with freshly made pesto, grilled octopus. Service is excellent, great bar. We will definitely return and with friends.  Do you like Negronis? I love Negronis. So, I was expecting to have a good one, here, and they did not disappoint. Not only was the classic spot-on, but also they offer many of the common variations (Mezcal, Sbagliato, etc.). However, don't let the name, or my cheesy lead-in, fool you. There is more to this restaurant than just the signature drink. They offer a fun and diverse menu with a South American take on sushi and fresh fish, reminiscent of, although not perfectly imitative, of Peruvian ""Nikkei""-style Japanese fusion. However, the several raw fish dishes were all good, but fell short of greatness - the fish was fresh, but the quality could-have-been-better, and I felt there was an attempt to disguise sub-prime quality through excessive seasoning (in my personal opinion, salmon tartar should not taste of garlic and onion powder), and so I will not be ordering that next time.  On the other hand, the Cesar salad is one of the best I have had anywhere in a long time - fresh, cheesy, not overly spicy - and the pommes frites (they call them ""home fries"" - no idea why - they're not what I would call ""home fries"", don't let this fool you), and risotto, were also excellent. Everyone who had the burger appeared to be enjoying it immensely, and I intend to try it next time I'm there. Pasta dishes also had great visual appeal from afar. 

I would highly praise, and offer a sixth star, if I could, for the service, including front-of-house staff and waiter Esteban, and love the ambience of the spacious and pet-friendly patio. There was great warmth. Read more Read more I was driving when this gorgeous wall of Campari caught my eye. So of course I had to check it out.
Negroni is Sushi Bar and Bistro with a lively ambiance.

We wasted no time and ordered some Negronis.
I went with the classic because I wanted to get the authentic experience and it was so refreshing.
Their crispy rice tuna and crispy rice toro were some of the best I‚Äôve had.
The roasted cauliflower was great. The vegan bagna cauda sauce on the bottom was the perfect pairing.
Their burrata salad with pesto and prosciutto was executed perfectly.
The mediteranan salad was refreshing and the chicken parmigiana was so delicious. It came with a side of squash pure that was so velvety and tasty.
I finished off with one more Negroni and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. this is such a fabulous dinner spot. Also, shout out to Paula for being a lovely server. Read more We had the seafood risotto and some sushi rolls. The service was amazing - I think the servers name was David. The manager was great, as well.  We had an unplanned lunch at Negroni on a weekday in August and really enjoyed it. What made our experience special wasn‚Äôt just the food but our server, an exceptional young man named David, who showed incredible enthusiasm for his work. We later learned that he is studying to become a lawyer, which was even more impressive and a reminder that whatever you do‚Äîeven temporarily‚Äîdo it well. This reinforces why human resources are a company's most valuable asset.

As for the food, the salmon and branzino were good, but I especially loved how they served the bread with creamed ricotta, honey, and truffle. ‚ò∫Ô∏è It was delicious!

I usually do not love going to Beverly Hills for a meal, but this space with it's indoor-outdoor feel, made me think I was having a pleasant lunch on the Amalfi Coast.

My wife ordered the rigatoni which she really liked but wasn‚Äôt mind blowing said she‚Äôd try something different next time. Now the star of the show was the sushi! I ordered the salmon crispy rice, yellowtail nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, and the truffle tuna roll! All were amazing and I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi!

The 5 Course with Wine Pairing was nothing short of spectacular. Each course was a revelation‚Äîdelicious, intricate, and surprising in ways that are rare to find these days. The sushi was incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, while each plate was presented like a work of art.

Read more First time here so we wanted to try a few dishes before ordering more.

What we ordered:

Toro sashimi & Hamachi sashimi - both taste like chef accidentally made it too sour and tried to cover up the sourness by drowning them in soy sauce. Each bite was either too sour or too salty 3/10

Chef‚Äôs sushi platter - aka chef took a trip to gas station to grab sushi and put in a nicer plate. It was that bad. The rice was not even sushi rice. Taste like leftover rice from the night before. Hard rice 0/10

Fried soft shell crab - decent 5/10

Crab maki - again. Hard rice and very little crab 0/10

Toro nigiri - took the rice out. Toro by itself was good 7/10

And complimentary dumpling with miso butter - decent 6/10

Total cost around $160

Arrived hungry, left hungry and disappointed.

Usually not the type to leave reviews but the restaurant need to make some major improvements if they want to stay in business. Especially the rice!

The staff and service were very good and the meal definitely worthwhile. Guess I'll put this place back on my regular list.  They close at 6:00 Sunday, so going after a show doesn‚Äôt work. Staff was wonderful and let us stay late with no problem. My friend‚Äôs pasta with clams and mussels came with mussels only.  Arrived at 5pm as booked with party of four. Placed orders approx 5:15pm indicating we had 6:30 tickets for theatre nearby. One member of the party told waiter of some serious allergies to help her make food selections. A member of the kitchen staff came to the table 5 min later to clarify the allergies. 15 min later served 4 buns. No one approached the table to update or even serve appetizers. Tables on both sides of us served by the same waiter, had full meals, desserts and paid bill and left even though they arrived later than us. After flagging the waiter down, our order was brought to the table at 6:18. It had to be refused as we had to leave for the theater as we could not eat or enjoy the food in 5 minutes. No explanation.
Told the manager as we left, that we received no food during our stay and had to leave. He was astounded as were we. He stated this has never happened in his experience nor mine, as I have eaten at Kendalls many times over the years. It's still hard to believe. Minimally the staff could have alerted us to any difficulties and possibly made adjustments in a timely manner. Read more Noticed our faves have gone up in price quite a bit!!
Good tho, great servers and very convenient brunch/lunch before the Opera in Sundays.  Pre-pandemic, Kendall's was a great restaurant for theater dining. Apparently those days are long-gone. On our first visit since pre-pandemic times, service was friendly, but not very attentive. The atmosphere was fine. They have a VERY limited brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday for lunch before theater in the Music Center. Food was acceptable, but mediocre and VERY overpriced.  I imagine the only reason they're still in business is because they're really the only ""show in town"" for convenient pre or post-theater dining at the Music Center.  We are a group of six who have season tickets to the Mark Taper Forum, and we love to meet and catch up over lunch before our Saturday matinees. The ONLY reason we might return will be if we can't find a decent location to easily dine before our shows in the future. Desperately searching for an alternative!! Read more Had a lovely waiter it was a little quiet due to the dodger game food was really good!  Great food and energy.  Was a me to quickly order and still make a Wednesday night LA Opera ‚ÄúMadam Butterfly ‚Äú in less than 1.5 hrs  Food & service excellent, especially our server Sylvan. She‚Äôs attentive, knowledgeable about menu items, so helpful, & always smiling.

The decor is disappointing. I heard 3 different diners around me last night express same negative feelings.
So cold & colorless now compared to previous decor that better reflected French brasserie vibe with unique murals, lovely wood furniture pieces.
Now it is uninviting, flat, & reminds me of an ugly high school cafeteria.
There are many more restaurants in the area of the music center, so diners have more options in the last few years.

A cocktail is $18 and a glass of Cabernet was $25. There are not a lot of food choices, but what they have is tasty and we found something we liked! I got beet salad with salmon and I loved it. The macaroons are a good small dessert at $2.50 each- that was the best bargain we had, but expensive for a macaron the size of a silver dollar. Our bill was $165 + tip, so over $200 for two people, a nice meal, but probably not worth $200 bucks. We paid for convenience to be close to the theater. Read more Josh was presenting all 4 wines. He explained where the wines came from and what taste to expect .
Very friendly and professional.
We had a very good time.
At the end we suppose to have a big presentation by a lady who made the wine choices. She was not there by the end of the evening. We did not have the presentation. I missed that part of The Wine Tasting.

It was a very nice idea to have evening like this. Sorry there were only a few people signed up for it.

Me and my wife were excited to try the cannabis cafe. We made reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes which is whatever but once we got seated the table was soooo small and in heavy traffic. We waited at our seats for 15 minutes before we got offered water. We noticed another table opened that sits two people so we asked the waitress if we can move to that table that had a bigger table and was not in heavy traffic. The waitress had no problem with it but said she needed to ask the front desk. When she came back she said they said no and we never saw out waitress again. We never got to try the food or weed we got up and left. BELIEVE the reviews about the service!!! It‚Äôs trash! Read more My husband and I came for our anniversary and the vibes were perfect. Will definitely be coming back with friends and family.  Enjoyed my time at the Cannabis Cafe. Per usual there are a lot of hidden fees and automatic tax as well as attempting to solicit additional tax that you will accidentally pay if you aren't attentive. Spending time in LA is already pricey and it's unfortunate  that these business want to milk the patrons for every cent they have. Outside of that the establishment  is wonderful and I will def return.

I did feel kind of rushed, and when I ordered the Caesar salad, it did not come with  any croutons. Just crumbs, which kind of made me feel like it was scraps sprinkled on top of my salad.. there was hardly any dressing. And my friend ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle was not fresh. It was flabby and rubbery .the food wasn‚Äôt that great Read more It was a very chill vibe it gave grown and sexy also good spot to have a date night  The server was really nice.

Marijuana is amazing.  10/10  We made reservations and was 20mins late due to traffic, our reservation was canceled and we were made to wait for an hour for a table.  Resturant does not offer alcohol beverages. Our meals were cold, the fries taste like they were cooked for only seconds then served. Our waitress was very pleasant and had  patience. And there is tax on their cannabis products. I don't think I would return and if so I'll go early in the day where the food is still fresh. Read more Great experience. Chill vibe.

The waiter was mediocre and the food had no seasoning but was good other wise  Great setting and great service! Everyone was nice and food was delicious.  the host was extremely rude and unreasonable for no reason. I couldnt understand why she was so sassy for no reason. When we got there the other half of our party wasnt there so we needed to wait for them, fine no problem. We were then told to sit at the bar to order a drink while we wait and were pointed to the cannabis bar where we waited for 15 mins just for someone to ask why were we sitting there. We then finally found the bar outside in the back with the drinks. While getting our drinks our party showed up and we attempted to go inside to be seated and were told the alcohol could not be brought inside to go back outside. Completely fine. The host had asked if we wanted to sit outside and I said yes since we couldn't bring the drinks in so we can just stay there. She then told me when had someone missing from our reservation when clearly there was 4 people so she made me step to the side to continue waiting (for nothing, just very sassy and rude for no reason) I then corrected her that my entire party was here and we were just waiting for the ok to stay outside. She then let me know that i need to bring my party back inside to her to wait at the end of the line, to go back outside to where we were at to complete the reservation check in. She then held up the line for many other people and when someone said something she rudely blamed it on me and basically said i was the hold up for everyone being seated yet she was making things overly complicated for seating (again for no reason, i was never rude to her) This host was polite to everyone else but us from what we saw. The weed was horrible. $60 after tax for a low shelf pre-roll pack and the joint is as skinny as a pencil if not smaller - tastes like you're smoking tap water.

The food and drinks were definitely the highlight of our evening... Though, $85 dollars for a 10 to 12 oz. Bone-In Ribeye was definitely disappointing... The staff was very friendly and the service was mostly great, however, I found it cumbersome to use a small gift card toward our hefty bill when the check came... I literally had to schlepp down two floors, and walk through all of Eataly, to reach Guest Services to quickly transform the gift code into an actual gift card. (This task would have been avoided had I been able to speak with a host prior to our dinner.) Then, schlepp all the way back, and unfortunately slipped and fell in a puddle of water near the elevator. Thankfully, I'm athletic and was not hurt... Oh, and when I returned I noticed that there was an item on our bill that we never received, some mushrooms, but at this point I just wanted to leave, frustrated as I was, as it was my Wife's Birthday and we had plans post dinner... At this price point, I hoped for A LOT more. I mean, maybe parking validation after a $400 meal all in?... I highly doubt we'll return. Read more I often find the food at nice restaurants in LA to be lackluster and not worth the money, prioritizing looks and ambiance over food and value. However, I found Terra to be well worth the meal and filling as well. We ordered the roasted meats for the table and it came with a number of grilled meats that had a nice charred taste owing to the wood-fire, and the seafood appetizer was light and refreshing. For our anniversary, the waiter brought us a cream puff, which was delicious as well. Overall, a great experience and would come back again! Read more Truly stellar Italian cuisine with an emphasis on grilled meats and vegetables. Extensive cocktail list making use of their extensive collection of amari.  Read more We experienced very poor service from the waiter as well as the other table staff. The food arrived late, to the point that we had to get it to go.  Everything was fantastic! My only complaint was there was no acknowledgment of our anniversary which was mentioned a few times during the booking  We used to like this restaurant but the prices keep getting higher and the food was not so great. We ordered a few dishes - the wagyu skewers for 36 dollars were 2 1‚Äù pieces of meat. It was ridiculous. Anyway we won‚Äôt be back. Read more Some of the food wasn‚Äôt properly cooked. Beautiful ambiance but expensive for the quality of food.  We were 4 people dining in. Two of us wanted the tasting menu which is priced per person and required  for minimum 2 people which was great. The couple that was worth us wanted to eat something else. They did not let us do that, they said everyone at the table had to order the tasting menu. I didn't find this logic at all, didn't understand why, since it is priced per person, and the other couple is ordering food, why we were not allowed to do that is beyond me. We ended ordering the Tuna, it barely comes with a bit of fris√© lettuce& cherry tomatoes, and my husband ordered the branzino that doesn't come with anything. Will not go back. Read more Good food. Great brunch atmosphere. Service is was okay, but we got a tasting menu so not as much attention may be needed? But enjoyed what we got.  Food overall was quite good - specifically focaccia, ragu pasta and pork skewer.  Shrimp skewer was just ok.  Drinks were fantastic and server was great.  DJ/music was fun too.  Maybe a little expensive for what it is but would go again for sure. Read more Every time I eat here, I feel very spoiled. Between the service and the food. Ôøº  Great service and fantastic food. Everyone was lovely & acknowledged our anniversary. Perfect night!  I have been dinning at Terra on the regular basis and we love the ambience and food.
But recently I feel they are taking for ride with
their prices.
I was there today and ordered Prix fixed menu.
But when the bill came, they added more charges. Also they charged us $10.00 for a balsamic dipping sauce!!!
We did complain and they took it out.
But I didn‚Äôt like that they were deceiving us.
Very disappointed.üòî Read more Read more Definitely worth a try for lunch-i would go late-1:30-very busy when we arrived so a bit noisy-quieted down a little later so much pleasanter-wish both was cushioned-not too comfortable and if someone seating behind you in a both a little wobbly-food was excellent-very rich and very pricey-service was perfect Read more Great restaurant with great food and service.

The mocktails are delicious  Beautiful outdoor setting. Olivia was an excellent server. Eggs Benedict Awesome!  a go-to brunch spot..! great food and non alcoholic bevs!  I‚Äôve been to Eataly twice for brunch and I just went for dinner and OMG the food/drinks is excellent. 100/100  What a disappointment. We had the tasting menu which seemed like a safe choice. The grilled peaches were rock hard. The ravioli was cold. The service was non-existent. We couldn‚Äôt even get water refills and our small table for two was littered with plates because nothing was cleared. When the hostess checked on us and we said the experience was very underwhelming she seemed not at all surprised, sadly. They comped us a dessert which we the only good thing about the meal. But even after remarking on the poor experience the staff was still inattentive and we couldn‚Äôt even get fresh water. It took 30 minutes to get the check. I cannot recommend this restaurant at all. Too bad this is where we opted to go for our wedding anniversary dinner. $250 for nothing but a long night of disappointment after disappointment. Not at all what I‚Äôd expect from Eataly. Read more Had a wonderful evening last Saturday night at Terra. Hadn't been in a few years and was encouraged to see that it was just as lovely on the outdoor deck as I had remembered. They had a DJ playing mellow dance music that wasn't too loud and provided some nice ambiance. They offered a tasting menu that was reasonably priced and had a lot of the ""greatest hits"" on it so my wife and I decided to try it. It was a LOT of food, we wound up taking some of almost every course to go. Peaches and Burrata salad, Mozzarella and Prosciutto, Mushrooms from the wood fired oven, Grilled Bread and Butter, Zucchini Squash Blossom Ravioli (we ate all of that dish, lol), and a whole grilled branzino with roasted potatoes. We started with a round of cocktails, the Sicario (a modern take on the Old Fashioned with Mescal) was delicious, we got a bottle of Italian Gamay which paired very well with the food on the tasting menu. The service was friendly and attentive without feeling pushy. Overall it was a lovely night and when the bill came it was surprising reasonable for the quality and quantity provided. We will definitely be coming back again soon, maybe with some friends next time. Read more Wasn‚Äôt impressed at all. Waitress took our order, most of our food came out but not all. She took our plates dropped off the bill trying to charge us for food we didn‚Äôt even get and then look surprised when we said something. Wood fired chicken was dry. Lackluster at best Read more Our server was Fantastic so knowledgeable and friendly. The food was excellent, we had 2 starters, 2 street food, 2 pasta dishes, one chicken, 2 desserts, 1 bottle wine, 2 cocktails and one cocktail.

We went on a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very full. We were immediately sat and the waiter took our drink and appetizer order quickly. Unfortunately we wanted a long time for a waiter to come back and take our entree order. The waiter was nice but seemed new. Another waitress kept coming by to help him. Our entrees were also brought out at different times. My friends pasta got cold while waiting for my lamb chops to come out. The Honey cake was outstanding. Read more The service and ambiance were great.
The food was below average. The wheel pasta was tasteless and so as the truffle, so disappointed for the price. The Caesar salad was basic also.
The drink was great. I guess instagram does what it does the best. promoting beautiful places.
Definitely not going back. Read more The Cacio E Pepe was amazing. Service was on point and the cocktails were amazing. Ôøº  It was underwhelming. Beautiful restaurant. The food was subpar, each dish we had had some type of issue. The bruschetta was ok but way too salty. The cheese wheel Cacio e Pepe was watery so it muted the flavor. Lamb wasn't bad but it was also too salty and the risotto had a muted flavor. Finally the scallops were ok but a bit overdone and the risotto in this also had a muted flavor. The food just wasn't flavorful. My friends had drinks and they were way too sweet.

Overall underwhelmed. Wouldn't go back. Nothing was repeat worthy. Read more Service was great, restaurant was so cool and loved the live music but sad that the food was just okay. We spent so much on the flaming cacio e Pepe and it was ice cold.  We made a last run at reservation as we were downtown and trying to find an Italian restaurant. What a find! We were with our dogs so they put us on the patio and it was quite comfortable. I loved that they knew I didn‚Äôt eat onions because they read my information on OpenTable! ÔøºWe were not super hungry so we started with the Bruschetta with Roman. It wasn‚Äôt a problem for them to make any changes we requested. This was a wonderful dish and I would even recommend this restaurant because of it!  Ôøº we decided to split the baked rigatoni Bolognese. As I did not want the bechamel sauce, they switched out for marinara without a fuss. The pasta was perfect. Love the vibe of restaurant inside, too. Our server, Bella, was on top of everything and dos a great job. Read more Very slow service, very high prices for the items served, very loud. It was a Saturday night, which can be a problem with crowds.
Would never consider returning. Read more It all started off with the parking situation! They had no valet, I guess valet was full. We had to go around for 20 minutes to find parking, then finally we valet with another restaurant Manuela. We walk in almost 40 minutes late. They accommodate us right away as the restaurant wasn‚Äôt that full. They were also  understanding of the the parking situation. Now, this is where it gets really really bad. We put in our orders right away as we were starving! My drink comes in 10 minutes which is fine, then followed by one of the appetizers‚Ä¶ we had to wait 30 minutes for our truffle French fries and 1 hour 15 minutes for two plates of pasta! The kitchen seemed a disaster, the chefs were in a panic mode‚Ä¶ no one was getting any food. All tables around us were waiting for their food. We knew coming in that service would be bad from all the reviews on Yelp, but yet we wanted to give it a try for its ambience and menu. The manager brought us a complementary honey cake and she was like here!! Sorry for the delay eat this until your food arrives. Really, you r expecting us to eat a cake before our main course. Long story short, my daughters pasta comes out after hour and 15 minutes cold and such a small portion and my ravioli which was disgusting! I don‚Äôt even know how I ate it. My daughter kept telling me, I can‚Äôt believe you ate that. At that point I was so starving, I ate and left the restaurant. We then took a bite of the cake and my daughter spit it out! It was so sweet and creamy! This place is overhyped! Overrated! Quality of food is horrible to what they‚Äôve priced. Good thing, I didn‚Äôt order a steak! What a horrible meat it would have been for paying $70. I wouldn‚Äôt step a foot in here ever again. If you want good service and quality food, this isn‚Äôt the restaurant for you. However, the only thing I enjoyed was my lychee martini. Not once our server came up to us apologizing for the delay or offering us bread and butter! We were given $3 off discount on our bill. Read more For this price point we were expecting much better food quality and service. They did not take our order all at once so it ended up taking over an hour for our entrees to come, I genuinely think they forgot our order. The staff did not communicate the delay clearly and I needed to get up and find our server to understand the delay. We had an 8pm reservation and didn‚Äôt end up getting it food till 10:20. Once the food arrived we weren‚Äôt given new cutlery and the pasta (which is over $30) was not edible. Half of our table was still hungry when we left the restaurant at 11pm and there was no manager in sight to speak to regarding our experience. I‚Äôm sure this place is great for cocktails but don‚Äôt bring your out of town family here for a nice dinner. If you‚Äôre going to charge $32-60 for an entree the least that could be done is to have a manager come and address the situation. We were so disappointed and will not come back. Read more My pasta in cheese wheel had these huge hard globs of cheese.  The beef tartare had not even a little drizzle of sauce it was ground beef served on toast.

Read more Read more The service is lackluster / had to explain allergy situation 3 times.  Bartender is running around serving - drinks arrive after course is completed.  The cheese wheel is a mush of pasta.  Service is slow and I am usually very patient. Ordered an app and two meals and that took 1.5 hours. Also all food came out warm, almost room temp. The vibe outside looks fancy the vibe inside is basic. Our server was nice enough but this dinner was not worth the price.

Server was great & food was delicious, definitely on the pricier side, but definitely would come back!! The cacio e pepe was amazing  We had an incredible dinner experience on Thursday evening. Our server, Bella, was fantastic and provided excellent recommendations for both appetizers and the main course. During our meal, we enjoyed live music from a singer named Kiera Lyons, who was absolutely phenomenal! After dinner, we moved to the bar to get closer to Kiera and watch her perform.

This so called Italian restaurant was discovered by me from Instagram a social media platform. It wasnt quite the show & experience, I have expected it to be. The service was okay but overall, I feel bamboozled. I ordered for my main course was the 'Wheel Cheese Cacio E Pepe' ,it was $68 for pasta & cheese basically & $15 add on for a small amount of truffles that was barely any shaved on to my plate. Also, I ordered half a dozen of oysters to give it a try & costed me $38 for poor quality. It wasn't cleaned correctly me & my wife had bits of shells in our mouths while chewing it was really unpleasant. Another order was 'Fish Of The Day' which was 'Sea Bream' $75 for a basic taste .
Overall basic & overpriced for everything.
I wouldn't reccomend this place to anyone at all & I have seen similar reviews i should've took note of before visiting this Restaurant. Read more Everything was amazing! The pasta cheese roll to die for  The drinks were great especially the pear martini 5 stars! The food was delicious however the portion size is so small and definitely not worth the price.

On a positive note, the service was excellent; the staff was attentive, friendly, and professional and they truly seemed committed to making the dining experience pleasant.

I don‚Äôt know if they think they can just say anything and people believe it. But someone that comes from customer service, and has eye balls. You can tell, this girl only wants to help the big groups.

It was my wife‚Äôs birthday!
She Order  gin wifh cucumber. Server Claudia said she will make it happen. Nice!
Got nothing she ordered. Was told they had to go get cucumber from another kitchen. When a cup of cucumber are sitting on the bar. And they have a drink with the same ingredient. By the way! My wife pointed that out to the server Claudia. ÔøºAnd she just walked away!

We ordered sides with the steak. Did not get what we ordered. We eat, and a side of veggies came out!? We asked for mushrooms. And we finish eating when it was out. Claudia said she did not hear the order! Really? Because when you pulled out your tablet it said mushrooms on  it!

If the server just said sorry, I made a mistake it would have been ok. Stuff happens. But don‚Äôt make things up , and expect people to go with it. No one likes a Pinocchio make Sh‚Ä¶ up!

I had better conversation with the bus-boy  and the restroom attendant. My wife said the same thing. Talk about service.

They are lucky the music and everything else was good. But if a server is going to make up anything, make sure the guest can‚Äôt see the BS.  Best of luck! Will not be back. Music is not worth it!

We came in for dinner before a movie specifically for the icons of Italy specials. Our server was great and even went out of his way to get us an old favorite drink from the bar. The negatives here are NOT about him. It‚Äôs all the food. Our bill was $125, $50 of which was alcohol. For the remainder we had 3 suppli, the GREASIEST cone of the smallest portion of calamari, etc, and the sausage/rapini pizza thing, which was tasty. The calamari in particular actually left a puddle of grease on the table.

Our server was not friendly and made the experience uncomfortable  We‚Äôve been going here for many years now and have always loved the food here. However, during our last visit, the quality of the food seemed to have gone down hill. I ordered Tagliatelle which was one of my favorite dish there but it was watery and bland. The focaccia rossa tasted like bread I can buy from grocery stores. We might give this place another try..Hopefully it was just one of those days and not a permanent thing. Read more Overall service level was fine. My friend enjoyed her pasta choice (lemon and tuna pasta). I opted for the salad ‚Äúcolorata‚Äù with shrimp on top. Yikes! Bad choice - salad was served in a very small plate - it was impossible to eat it. I had to ask for a larger dish. The salad was hard to eat even in the larger plate / not chopped or cut so you were dealing with large pieces of greens.  Shrimp was fine. Would not order that again.  I didn‚Äôt even finish it.

She was pretty rude saying my reservation was at 1:00, it was 12:55 when I went to her; she ignored my request twice after 1:00 pm said we will have to wait and we‚Äôd have to move aside for her to accommodate ‚Äúwalk ins‚Äù. The server approached us twice and we had to ask for water twice as well. Long story short, the food was ‚Äúnot comercial grade‚Äù, it didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúdefrosted‚Äù neither was ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù; the place was nice and clean.

Read more Delightful very fresh food and thoughtful efficient service, we will be back!  Saturday night at around 730. The place was busy and the kitchen seemed to have been overwhelmed. Appetizers were fine but all our entrees were big misses. Halibut, steak were well overdone. And the seafood pasta had cold shellfish that seemed parcooked; placed last minutely.

She liked this dish very much.  I ordered the MEZZI PACCHERI AL RAGU NAPOLETANO which was very tasty.   My husband ordered the RAVIOLI CAPRESE which he liked very much.  We ordered a fried calamari as an appetizer for the 3 of us which was very good but was too small for three people.  Our waitress Val was very friendly and attentive.

Drinks were amazing. when I made reservations on Open Table, I messaged the restaurant and chose the option that I was celebrating my sisters birthday. I guess no one at the restaurant looks at that or reads the message with reservations. It was disappointing. :/ Read more Great food and ambiance. I‚Äôve been a few times, going back for sure.  Rushed service, food was oily and lukewarm. Would not recommend.  A little disappointing frankly. We did the special menu. The radicchio salad had a lot of rotted/turning edges.

He provided a sampler to help us make our decision.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend this place and to make reservations. Read more I‚Äôm a bit disappointed with Eataly pushing the whole Italian vibe when they aren‚Äôt even close. I had high hopes for Capri, but knew we were in trouble when we ordered the caprese ($21) and received a relatively good sized piece of mozzarella, then, I kid you not, maybe two small slices of tomato cut in half. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Luckily, the waitress was really nice and got us two more slices of tomato. She actually said she had to ask the kitchen if she could do that. The spaghetti alla nareno was also a disappointment. It was bland and for the key ingredient, zucchini, there were maybe 6 small slices. And that was $29. Come on, Eataly. We just returned from Italy and food was not this expensive and was 100 times better. Read more Always have a nice dining experience at Capri. The service is very friendly and professional.

I would recommend you check out this restaurant for good food, reasonable prices and good service.
Plus a great Italian food market! Read more Read more Overall food was good. Ragu pasta a little dry. Foccacia was good and the lunch specials were a nice variety. Staff did great job with birthday requests. Only drawback to area is you get a lot of children, as it is a mall, and so it's not the place for a ""relaxing"" lunch. Read more Horrible food. Low quality food. So disappointing. Very overpriced for what it is. You expect much more from Eataly. There is much much much better Italian food in Los Angeles.  It's a wonderful, low-key place for lunch, and the specials are great.  From the moment I walked in the door to Eataly, I felt as though I had been transported to Italy.  It was an absolute feast for the senses!  

We enjoyed dinner at Capri.  Our meals were divine:  pasta nerona was such a simple but luxurious dish, and my husband had a substantial pasta dish with bolognese sauce. The radicchio and artichoke salad was refreshing and satisfying, and the panna cotta with fruit and crumble was out of this world.   

We will definitely return!  Thank you for a real treat. Read more Always delicious and Eately is a beautiful market.  Steak overcooked and poorly cut.
Octopus ragu flat taste.
Sea Bass swimming in broth.

On the bright side our server was attentive while not cloying.

The only thing good about this restaurant is that it is inside the eataly supermarket.
Pricey for the quality. Portions to small. Not coming back Read more Delicious food and a stunning setting with outstanding services.  Yet again there true Italian experience where the plates have the essential flavors and top quality ingredients that make the whole experience magic. They also respect the time required between one course and another to make it a pleasant expertise rather than a rushed  meal. Read more The food was ‚Äúokay‚Äù for how much you pay for it. The ambience was beautiful and we had high expectations for the food. Everything was lacking seasoning and salt. The best thing we ordered was the yellowtail carpaccio. For $350 dollars we were left incredible underwhelmed. Service was great. Next time we likely will skip the restaurant and order around the shops.

Food was amazing, server was lovely, dessert good. And for our anniversary they gave us sparkling wine and a non alcoholic drink. Would definitely come back here Read more Beautiful spot tucked away in an industrial area so was a great surprise how cute and quaint it was. We loved our cocktails, and the mushroom bucatini was delicious! So we're the tator tots, kinda spicy and different. Great spot! Read more Ambiance is great. Cute patio for a group dinner. Cocktail are delicious. Food is tasty! Had dinner w/ party of four. Had: Scallops, (2) Short Ribs, Chilean Sea Bass.  Everyone was completely satisfied w/ their meal. Only complaint, the side of Broccolini was seasoning less.

We all agreed would come back! Read more I have always thought the Raymond was a cut above, but found the whole experienced undistinguished this time.  Granted, it was a Saturday night and very busy, but food was just disappointing.  Tomatoes in tomatoes with burrata were not tasty, burrata was good, but no tasty vinaigrette garnish.  Steak frites was fine but not very flavorful, and the frite were so ordinary and limp that didn't bother to eat them.  Peppercorn sauce was meh.  Didn't hear my out of town guests raving about their food either.  Won't make it an effort to return any time soon. Read more Delicious , our server Clifford was very attentive, answered all our questions. Sea bass was amazing. Ten stars .  Great experience! Our waitress was fantastic! Looking forward to coming back  Food was tasty, service was attentive, valet service forgot to give me my car keys and I ended driving 20 miles and then my car stalled. Contacted the manager at the restaurant who referred me to their valet manager, Scott.  He continuously stated that the valet didn't have my keys and that supposedly I had them; obviously I did not since my car stalled and I could not start my car without my keys! Finally, Scott told me they found my keys and he had one of his guys drive them to me, which frankly was the least he could do, being that I was stranded in 100 degree heat on the side of the road and arguing with him for about an hour. Scott then stated he would ""take care of me"" and ""make things right"" which he never followed through on.  

Bottom line, I won't be going back to The Raymond. As much as I like the actual restaurant, the valet service is a dealbreaker. People go out to enjoy and have a nice experience, the valet service ruined that and could have handled the situation better. Disappointing. Read more This was our second time visiting the Raymond.
We were very pleased with the quality of the food. All the appetizers and mains arrived quickly at the appropriate temperature.

All of our party thought the service could be improved however.  Our server presented as indifferent and unengaged.  It appeared as though she was more interested in efficiency rather than presentation of knowledge of particular dishes, suggestions and the like. Our server was not bad‚Äîbut definitely could benefit from some nuanced service. The art of reading the room seemed to be lacking. There were sharp transitions from appetizers to mains and dessert and placement of the check with the obligatory, ‚Äúwhenever you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù We were the last seating for our table, so it wasn‚Äôt an effort to turn the table over. Perhaps just a lack of polish.
We will give The Raymond more chances as the food delivers and the atmosphere is pleasant at a fair price point.

My friends and I enjoyed the food and cocktails at The Raymond while having a birthday celebration. The service provided by Sarah was friendly and attentive.

The service was great‚Äîour waiter was friendly and kind‚Äîbut the food was a major disappointment. We ordered the crabcake benedict, which was unbearably salty, and the smoked salmon toast, which was completely bland. The panna cotta was far from creamy, with a texture closer to cottage cheese. Even the bread tasted like cardboard.

The menu is easy to understand and each dish complement's the others. To start, we had the Quail Skewer and Balsamic Glazed ribs. We then had the Tomato Peach Salad.  Each were very tasty. Our main was the Whole Fried Snapper. The fish was good. 

The support staff (food runners) was very attentive. We only saw our waiter 3 times the total 1:45 that we were seated. On the second visit to the table he said, ""I have been taking care of a table inside"". The final visit was a fly by to ask if we had decided on a desert, which was difficult to do considering that he had not provided us a menu that T&R does not have nor told us the nights selections. 

I highly recommend this Tar & Rose!!!

One last note, we sat in the back on a converted dock, which is inspired use of space and made having a conversation very easy. This is area to sit.

For us, the absolute star of the show is the strawberry crostata which is a pastry topped with a custard and fresh, warm strawberries and served with a carmel ice cream. It's unbelievable and the best dessert I've ever had. The atmosphere is buzzy but not obnoxious as you can actually hold a conversation. Service is always attentive and excellent.

The humita was great, burrata was good and the ‚Äúwagyu‚Äù was awful and not a true wagyu. There was absolutely no marbling, flavor, marinade or seasoning. Just a slight smokiness and the cut was tough like brisket. Absolutely not worth the $89.

The waiter put it back in its original position, but it wasn't the cake. This cake was custom-made, so it was impossible for the waiter to put it back in its original position.
What's so great about an expensive restaurant that serves delicious food? This is the restaurant that ruined my daughter's one and only sweet 16th birthday cake!!!!!
Can you call a restaurant like this a great restaurant?
In my experience, it's a shame to give a restaurant only one star for its lack of common sense.
My daughter will never have another 16th birthday party because time cannot be turned back.
I will never go to this restaurant again. The restaurant owner needs to choose his staff wisely. Read more Food was incredible. Josh and the rest of waiters staff made this a once in a lifetime culinary experience.
We thought we were eating at an Iron Chef show it was soooooo good!! Read more Everything we had was delicious! We were still talking about the food the next day.  Seats were very uncomfortable. Temperature was freezing . Wasn‚Äôt what I expected at all.  Great experience for my daughter‚Äôs 14th birthday .  Amazing food. Those who love Nobu rarely discuss the goodness of the food. It is very important not to run into the hostesses at the door as happened to us. With the place half empty and with a  reservation, they made us still wait 30 minutes without even a kind word or gesture.
At Nobu they should know better than others, the work of those at the door is crucial to the success of an evening. Read more It‚Äôs always a treat to experience this fine establishment.  They were supposed to bring the cold dishes first but they brought out the hot. They said the kitchen was backed up but the table next to us ordered the same thing 30 mins after us but they received it before us. Also we ordered but 10 minutes later they say they‚Äôre out of all tacos. There‚Äôs little things that bother me if I‚Äôm paying for a high value meal. The soy sauce pourer was chipped, the floors were sticky, the front hostess didn‚Äôt acknowledge us entering or leaving and we had to wait over 25 mins after our reservation time for our table even though we were there early. I‚Äôve been to other Nobus but others were definitely a better experience. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/51531154.webp

 like fried chicken, french fries, and desserts.  I love Yardbird in Las Vegas, I decided to visit again after 2 years to return to the Beverly center restaurant, all I can say is the service was awful requested from manager to change waiters due to waiting for drinks sitting at bar 20 min appetizers 20 sitting on top with no one bringing over food. They gave us the second waiter who was very polite but it was already disappointing the service.
Chicken is not the same as Vegas, returned truffle fries came cold, Mac and cheese was awful! Something needs to change ! Very disappointed and will not return. Read more Yard urd was great. The service was great and so was the food.  Best fried chicken in Los Angeles. Great ambience and top service.  Such a great experience coming in here. We stopped by before a concert at the Greek and did not regret it one bit. The staff was very friendly and helpful, food came out quick and was hot and fresh. The manager Tommy stopped by a couple times to check on us and we ended up having a conversation with him which was a nice touch. Overall, we had a great time and will definitely be coming back. Read more The food was good - consistent with Miami and Las Vegas. Service was not good. 1) food allergies were part of the reservation through OpenTable and server did not check. This needs to be standard SOP when they take a table. 2) I asked for ice in a glass three times with the person who was running food from the pass to tables. Eventually I went to the bar myself to ask for a glass with ice. I even walked right by the GM who saw me and did not offer to assist. The bar tender seemed like it was a difficult task to fill a glass of ice. At one point, the GM was dancing as well as the bar tender. Maybe their time should be better served focusing on customers and staying focused on what they are paid to do. Tip was reduced due to lack of good service. Read more As southern food goes it is was ok. It would not make the grade there, the fried chicken is not double battered with a light flaky crust (not nearly as good as Popeye's or Churches), the corn bread is more of a cake texture/like vs corn meal with stronger corn flavor. The Honey  Hot sauce is very Chilula tasting (great if you like it, and I do) with dab of honey, not unique. All that said he portions were good, staff very nice and helpful.

I asked if that guaranteed choice of Shabu Shabu with sashimi. We don‚Äôt like prefixe. I like sushi. I would pay prefixe if we got to try and cook ourselves and the fee got us entrance into sinners and santos. They said yes over and over. We would get sushi and our choice of shabu shabu. And get in to sinners and santos.

We went. Other people got out of prefixe. Our meal was late and expensive and not what we wanted. The second course came before our drinks. I hate truffles and dislike tempura. And we left hungry. Watching other people order what we thought we could. And sinners and santos wasn‚Äôt even open. I was livid.

The staff was wonderful (seriously) just totally clueless to what we paid for. But we were MASSIVELY disappointed.

Also the bathrooms were dirty and trashy and halls dirty.

We are in love and still going home happy with each other.

But Worst use of money we‚Äôve paid in so long. Read more Although the ambiance and performances were entertaining our experience at Lucky Mizu was very disappointing. It took over 15 minutes to get our order in. We received our hot pot meat 10 minutes before our vegetables and our sides (rice, sauces, noodles). We asked Chris another waiter who was working near us if we could call our waiter to receive the rest of our hot pot items so we can eat. Instead of ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find out what‚Äôs going on with your order‚Äù. He rudely replied ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you just get your meat right now?‚Äù When we replied ‚Äúno‚Äù he became even more rude and decided to say ‚ÄúOhh really, that‚Äôs odd.‚Äù And proceeded to walk away after. We waited another 30 minutes to get our check. They automatically charged 20% gratuity on our check. No wonder the workers here feel entitled to treat their customers poorly. They don‚Äôt have to provide the customer service worthy of a 20% gratuity. I have worked as a waitress for over 6 years and understand how hard being a waiter can be. But our experience was disappointing. Read more If you want over priced mid sushi üç£ come here. Drinks were good, there was entertainment as well. Service was decent, but not to be automatically charged 20%!!! Thought this was complete unfair when it was only two of us. We had 5 items and 3 drinks and total was almost $300 including the 20% service charge. Not to mention the $12 table that I was unaware of. Apparently it was Evian water, when it was being refilled from a pitcher. CRAZY! Read more Service was poor and the serving size was very small with very high prices. We did not get utensils until we were almost done and my friend ordered a second drink that never came. They also added a 20 percent tip which I would not have left. Only thing that saved it was ambience. Read more Very stinky place you smell a horrible fish smell mix with meat from the moment you enter the place not even the restaurant loud very loud we had to leave as soon as we walked in  Overpriced and not much food for the price. I think the menu is pretty vague as well.  The fish quality and overall food quality is not good. So many other places to go for sushi in LA.

Read more This is a bar where they serve sushi, and Ramen . The food was delicious, but is not to be considered a place where you go for dinner it's more a night club setting that serving sushi and drinks.

The highlight of the restaurant is the ambiance and look of everything, quirky and polished at the same time. Where it needs improvement is the quality of the food and guest experience.

Food was good as always but the service for a birthday should have been better.  Reliable, wide variety of Mexican food, all of which is pretty tasty.  My personal favorite is the mango salad.  Add chicken, and it's very rich, very filling.  Good salsas and guacamole, too.  Service was excellent. The food was hit and miss. Our drinks of mojitos and margaritas were refreshing and made well. Table made guacamole tasted good but the whole ‚Äúfresh made at table‚Äù was not well executed. Seemed like it was way boring for the presenter who did not do well in mixing the ingredients. Probably 60-70 percent mixed up. The Chili Rellanos were tastee and fresh but the cheese inside was not fully melted.

My cioppino was excellent as well as my husband's blackened salmon. We did not have dessert, but did have excellent martinis before dinner with delicious sour dough bread.

The skirt steak looked like a pretty pathetic piece of meat. Definitely didn‚Äôt look like any skirt steak I‚Äôve ever had before. I wouldn‚Äôt have served that piece if I was the chef. The scallops came with 3 but looked like they were sliced in half horizontally. The dessert missed the mark completely. The Elvis is a plate of pudding, chocolate sauce and more creamy peanut butter substance.

Maybe would be ok to come for a drink at the bar at best. Read more It was a dual celebration: a birthday and a promotion! Was awesome and we will be back!!  Great shared plates and stellar service. Wonderful atmosphere.  Read more Loved the cocktails. And delicious scallops and side of blistered green beans. Couldn‚Äôt leave without a cheddar bacon biscuit.  Food was excellent and so was the service.  Menu is creative with lots of choices of dishes to share.  We enjoyed the biscuits and the fries and the pretzel.  Pastas were also excellent as was the grilled skirt steak. Our server made some helpful suggestions too. Read more We were able to get and get seated promptly, brunch crowd was pretty much gone. Our server was also the bartender. He‚Äôs a gem. He made us feel so welcomed, checked on us often, refilled our water and made the BEST drinks. I could‚Äôve just hung with him all day. Food was great. Dipping sauce for potatoes is divine. But really, our server made the whole experience spectacular. Read more What happened to this place? Before the remodel it was a great place to go for a solid meal. Now it‚Äôs so loud that my friend and I had to yell across the table to hear each other.

They seated us 20 minutes after the reservation time. The waiting area is awkwardly small and the hosts seemed uninterested in directing traffic.

Service took forever.

Bar service was poor. An old fashioned is made with a single block ice cube, not a bunch of small cubes.

So is the tai shrimp, skirt steak and the green beans.
The lamb is the thing to get for sure!!  Best meal and service we‚Äôve had in quite awhile. We will be back soon.  The food was good -- nothing spectacular.  The flavors were good, and the dishes looked amazing, but the experience didn't really all come together.  The chicken sandwich was particularly a let down.  With the height of the biscuit, it was impossible to take a bite of the whole thing together, so you'd have to cut it up, but the crumbly-ness of the biscuit (which is kind of the point of the thing) made it difficult to cut a bite.  Additionally, the breaking on the chicken didn't adhere to the meat well at all, so the bite you're left with is overall disappointing.  Similarly, the reuben hash looked phenomenal, but it just sort of devolved into a sloppy mess.  It might have worked better with a lot less kraut (or none at all IMO) and a thinner, crispier potato pancake on the bottom.  

Overall, the meal was ALMOST amazing but fell a little short. Read more This used to be our favorite brunch spot because of its rustic charm, community vibe, and delicious food. All of that has been remodeled to within an inch of its life. It now resembles a Marriott lobby. The food is fine, but the wonderful cast iron skillets of delicious breakfast treats that invariably left rings on the table have given way to unremarkable corporate food and ambiance. Even our waiter acknowledged the restaurant has changed, and not for the better. Sadly, we will not be returning. Lots of new spots have opened in MB, so we will be trying those. Read more As usual, everything was fantastic!  I ordered my porterhouse pork chop medium rare.  When it came out medium-medium well I sent it back and the next time they got it perfect!  And for whatever reason they sent out 3 dishes ""on the chef"" - the bib lettuce salad (delicious!) and 2 desserts.  I'm on a keto diet and don't eat dessert, but I had to try just a bite of the basil ice cream.  Sounds weird, I know, but honestly it may have been the highlight of the meal!  Also I brought 2 bottles of fantastic wine with me (I'm a maniac collector and have an Internet wine business because of it) and there was no corkage fee to be found on the bill.  This was a dinner with my nephew and his family who are visiting from Philadelphia and I was happy to treat them to some of the best dining in the South Bay!

The menu was geared toward Fall which was appropriate, the scallops were cooked to perfection...  If you enjoy SoCal weather and being by the marina, you really can‚Äôt beat Cast and  Plow .. we were a table for 2 and requested to sit outside which was available. They have some really nice tables outside that have a built in fire pit and sit right next to the edge of the establishment. Highly recommend  them when dining here if weather is on par. Service was well trained, I never refilled my own water once and tables cleared accordingly. Food was well executed, nicely presented‚Ä¶ my salmon was well cooked and seasoned. And the server mentioned the chef recommends medium which it was and I agreed myself to enjoy it that way. The mushroom in the dish could need some help. My son had the Mishima farms Wagyu burger, only complaint is that when you ask for a burger medium it should be medium. Not well cooked ‚Ä¶ but nonetheless everything else was great. For desserts try the chocolate tower cake and cookies , both are very good. The ritz Carlton cake was very small portion, even though the quality of ingredients are good. Have been here a few times but not since the pandemic, so it was nice to enjoy ourselves here once again... We will be back again I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶. Read more Love the outdoor seating with fire pits at tables.  The restaurant has a good view to the harbor and the service is at the 5-star level. The fireplace on the table is very nice. However, the quality of the food is poor. We ordered jidori chicken and steak. They are both as hard as rock. The chicken has no taste on the skin or inside. I suspect the chef didn‚Äôt season it. Read more The hostess & server were both phenomenal. Otherwise this was mediocre at best. My husband and I were celebrating our third wedding anniversary. We just wanted to do something nice and low-key. We thought this would be a great option. We live close by. I can‚Äôt express the disappointment in the food. When you think Ritz Carlton, you think exceptional in every way. That is not what this was. We ordered the burger and the ribeye sandwich and they both were eh. They were flavorless and the patty on the burger was well done which for my husband and I is a big no no.Ôøº I will say the presentation was lovely. We have no intentions of coming back for lunch, but I would be opening to try it for dinner. Ôøº Read more Food, drinks and staff always go above and beyond. Everything was just amazing!!

Food was really good, nice views and outdoor seating was uniquely quiet. The fire pit in the each table was a special touch.  This spot is going downhill. With such a great location and beautiful view it needs a remodel/ facelift. There is zero vibe, the food is not great and the service is slow. It feels a bit out of sorts unfortunately and this place should be a total hit, gem, vibe and hot spot for singles and out of towners. How can we fix this?

Loved our meal  I had brunch with my friend & we had a pleasure to have Severine as our waitress. She's very professional & gracious - can't wait to go back.  Really nice ambience but they need to give more food for amount they charge , $45 for salmon for just small piece of salmon and minimal veggies is not enough  The service was excellent, as the ambiance. Great wines, menu options, however I was taken back by the use of salt. I had dined prior and has the mixed green salad, which had salt sprinkled on it and was told it was from the sunflower seeds, so I skipped the seeds to find salt still sprinkled on the salad, which was disappointing. Similar my salmon entree was salty.  Future dining, will require the low salt where there‚Äôs an option. The tofu, shrimp as sides to a salad were excellent. The atmosphere for dining is fantastic.

The salmon is mouth watering, not sure how they do it but the taste and quality of this dish has been consistent for the past five years. Crunchy skin, warm throughout at medium temp with a buttery and tasty  flavor in each bite.

Also, my new favorite has become the cauliflower appetizer. This dish is cooked to perfection with the right crisp crunch, memorable! To accommodate my allergy they substituted a chef‚Äôs inspired buffalo sauce. Wow, it burned so good!

They also serve several varietals of the Wagner Family wines from Napa. For the Pinot Noir snobs I recommend Boen.

Kinsey celebrated our 31st wedding anniversary and delighted us with this beautiful chocolate mousse cake.

Disfruta!
Enjoy! Read more Food was excellent, but not a wide variety of choices. It would have been nice to be served the additional items that were needed without having to ask (and wait), such as sugar, condiments, etc. I specifically requested a table in total shade and received acknowledgement that the request was heard, and then I was immediately offered a table in partial sun. When I repeated the request, I was then offered a small table in the high traffic aisle that also had the possibility of sun, when all other patrons were seated at large and shaded tables. We finally got the issue rectified, but it should have been honored or explained by staff at the beginning. My sandwich fell apart (avocado made the ingredients too slippery) and could not be eaten by hand, but it was quite tasty and had to be eaten with a fork and knife. The bread was phenomenal. My dining guest ordered the salmon and it was also phenomenal and perfectly prepared. The Cajun Frites are a must. Thankfully, the restaurant offers a discount for parking (would have been $60), but in my opinion it is still too high at $18 for a 2-hour lunch in the middle of the week, especially when my vehicle was parked 20 feet from the door in the sun. The patio area is a delight -- a true stress reliever to sit out in the quiet near the water. The interior lounge area is also quite nice and an inviting place for a cocktail. Disappointed that the gift shop did not offer any RC items, or not very many at least. I was specifically looking for the hotel signature home fragrance collection, and this location didn't offer it. All in all, the service was attentive and the chef created exquisite dishes, and it was actually rather reasonable when considering portions and food sourcing. It is worth a visit.

First time here, the place is brand new, clean. I sat at the sushi bar, the sushimen were all very nice and friendly. The fish were very fresh. Very good!  My husband and I were walking by and decided to inquire about gluten free or celiac friendly options, almost half of their menu for UMI did! The hostess was sweet enough to get us a table without a reservation. The place was pretty full, but the server Amy took her time to go over the menu and narrowed down the allergens for me by marking it. It was a beautiful gesture and nice knowing we had someone who cared. Having a restaurant equipped with talented sushi chefs so innovative with their GLUTEN FREE options is so rare for me. They thought of everything including gluten free TEMPURA and their house soy being tamari!!!!!

The dishes were some of the best I have ever had, and we ventured to many places before, including Japan. This was a spur of the moment find, and we continued the fun in being surprised by letting our server know how adventurous we were (thought they were bringing blowfish for a second lol), and she took over ordering for us. 

Food summarized in one word: WOW. The fish tasted like it was straight out of the sea! It's hard to pick favorites, but the uni, toro, red snapper specialty, and ceviche will slap your taste buds in a way you never knew was possible. Alcohol selection was great too, the Demon Slayer Sake was the right amount of dry; Dassai 39 Sake was the perfect harmony of dry, sweet and crisp notes.

The staff do a great job at making the guests feel welcome and I really appreciate that, especially when I travel out of my area to dine somewhere. The ambience is nice, relaxing & dim - very sexy and romantic which I love, especially after a long and busy drive from the west side. The music is mainly house music and a mix of eclectic and the noise volume is perfect (not too loud). For cocktails, the bartender created a nice concoction with whiskey which was not only tasty but also very beautiful. I really enjoyed it and also the feeling of relaxation it offered me afterwards. It was my first time dining at UMI tonight and I tried a variety of dishes and was delighted with all of them. First off I ordered the halibut which was soft, chewy, a bit spicy and mostly extremely exotic and delicious (super authentic!) and I loved it! Also, had to order the baked crab hand roll which was the best I have ever tasted - UMI makes all the other sushi restaurants I know a thing of the past.

The back parking lot for customers is an accident waiting to happen. The parking lot is so poorly lit and desperately needs better lighting for safety! There appeared to be a single, small motion detector light, but that only worked, when standing far off to the side.

Will definitely be making this a regular spot.  Excellent service and food. Seated quickly and was not rushed.  We went in on a slow night, and they had a private party in the other room, but that still doesn‚Äôt excuse the lack of service we experienced and how terrible the food was.  I brought my wife here and we were scouting it out for a larger work dinner in the future. Needless to say we won‚Äôt be coming back.  The cocktails were tasty, but it took 25 mins from when we ordered until we got our drinks.  We ordered 4 dishes that were said to be sent in two courses.  Everything came separately over 1.5 hrs.  The crispy rice spicy tuna was ok, nothing special and too heavy on the unagi.  The spicy tahini date salad was a complete disappointment. The gem red leaf lettuce was old and wilted, and they tried to hide it under entirely too much dressing.  For entrees we had the bolognese and pork chop.  The bolognese sauce was good, but their homemade pasta was overcooked and soggy.  The biggest disappointment of the night (besides not getting food for 1 hour after ordering it) was the pork chop.  They clearly were behind in the kitchen so they pounded a bone in pork chop thin, as if they were preparing schnitzel, then quick fired it an burnt the heck out of it.  It was crusted in fennel seed/pollen, that all became charcoal the chop was dry as jerky.  It was served with a watery salsa verde, not sure it‚Äôs fair to call it salsa, and grilled apples the were freezing cold.  The whole thing was an insult to the animal it came from and the cuisine it tried to be.  We struggled to get our water refilled and a second round of cocktails, and finally the waiter realized how dissatisfied we were with the food and apologized and said he would remove the pork chop from the bill.  We then received apologies from two other members of the staff who proclaimed ‚Äúthis is not the kind of food we serve‚Ä¶ we are so sorry, etc‚Äù even with the pork off the bill the meal was over $200 for 2 people and the most disappointing meal I‚Äôve had in recent memory. Read more Love the food and vibe at Wolfsglen!  Will definitely be back!!  We went at brunch, so it was very quiet. Only a handful of people in there.

Read more The restaurant was almost empty because we were there early and the a/c had been out for weeks. Not good when it‚Äôs 80 degrees out. The pizza was delicious so the only thing that will probably be an issue is that even though the restaurant only had 7 people in it, they would not make any changes to our order in any way. The kitchen flatly refused.   I believe that that will be a major issue for this restaurant in the future Read more Good food. Menu was in transition so kitchen / bar did not have everything on menu, which was not communicated up-front.  Visiting from out of state - after reading the reviews, I was excited to try this place. It was a disappointment all around. When we arrived, nobody greeted us for a couple of minutes. We stood there and contemplated leaving, but gave it some more time. The hostess stand was empty, and nobody said anything from the bar, even though we were making eye contact with the staff behind the bar. There were only about 2-3 tables in use - the restaurant had opened an hour prior, so it wasn‚Äôt busy at all. We sat‚Ä¶ we ate‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt really see the server much after taking our order. Didn‚Äôt ask us how everything was until we finally were able to get his attention for the check. For 2 people, 1 pizza, 1 pasta, & 2 drinks, and very average service, $120 didn‚Äôt seem justified. Had the food & experience been great, I wouldn‚Äôt have had a problem at all with the price tag. The reviews appear to be great, so maybe it was just an off night. But we were pretty bummed. Read more Noise was deafening. Usually love the food but pizza with artichokes short on them and filled up with potatoes. Manager offered relieve on future seating. Will try again.  Read more Went there for lunch with a friend.  Restaurant was almost empty.  We both ordered the burgers, which were recommended by our server and also promoted my the restaurant.   They came out extremely overdone and pretty tasteless.  When we complained to the server, he asked if we wanted rare burgers.  We explained that the burgers were beyond well done and he replied they‚Äôre better at dinner when they‚Äôre made to order.  No idea what that says about how they‚Äôre made at lunch!  Avoid this place. Read more Excellent food and wonderful service.  The burgers were exceptionally good!  Excellent food.  Regretfully they were u restarted and service was  out slow and left numerous tables un-cleaned making it less than an appetizing atmosphere.  This was my second time here. Food was just as good the second time around.  Lovely experience, everything was delicious!  I will definitely return.  Wonderful food- unique and unusually good. Went for pre-theater early dinner on a weeknight‚Ä¶music was on the loud end especially for early evening‚Ä¶but still a great experience overall.  Food was just OK. The French fries were the best thing!  Casual, pub-type atmosphere; noisy with live music upstairs; varied menu and creative cocktails; very good pizza  The food was really good cocktails were wicked yummy too.  Perfect before our Ahmanson theatre tickets!  Had 5:45 reservations and were able to leisurely order, enjoy and get there in plenty of time.

Every server we've had is quick to take our order, refill drinks, check in on us and make sure we have everything we need. Easily located, massive parking and they do validate!
We always order the change spicy chicken, it's gluten free!
The chicken lettuce wraps gluten free without mushrooms, Mongolian beef gluten free, fried rice that comes with each dish, and their iced tea!
They have great sushi options, crispy fried green beans, silken tofu, and noodle dishes that we adore!
If you're vegan, vegetarian, dairy or gluten free this is the restaurant for you!
Fantastic for done in or carry out, they have happy hour specials as well!
I've tried a few of their signature cocktails and they're all delightful.

Our server forgot one of our dishes and told us that it was packed to go by mistake, points for creativity but we received the dish after everything else was finished.

Cocktail Manhattan quite nicely made. The Malbec we ordered was ok.
The food was fresh, properly prepared. The main dishes were rich, but not balanced with a vegetable. I could have eaten 1/3 less of the main and had a break from the richness of cremes, fats and spices with some smaller side of something less rich, pasta, rice or a vegetable.
Our desert was creme brul√©. Seemed like it was not just prepared for us, no heat in the caramelized topping, neither hot nor cold center, and underwhelming as a result. Almost every restaurant these days has this dessert offered, so one would hope to have an excellent version at Malbec.

Only downside no public parking valet onlyÔøº  Been going there for a really long time. The food is always amazing. Ôøº  I love the ambiance of this location.  Unlike others, the Sherman Oaks venue has an open floor area (no dividers) which was perfect for a celebration.  The wait staff was flexible and on point on a busy Sunday.  The only drawback was not being acknowledged by 2 male hosts as I stood patiently in front of them to ask a question.  I think it would be a good practice of customer service to at least MAKE EYE CONTACT with a patron and signal that you'll be with them shortly.

Read more I‚Äôve been coming here for about 5 yrs, service has always been great but this time  not so great.
First our server Khalib was some what disinterested in his work. When we asked him about certain items on the menu he stated that he has never tried anything because the company is cheap and won‚Äôt let the servers try the food which is a disservice to the customers.  Asked him about flavors of their iced tea he said only one flavor when I asked him about a posssibily of other flavors he said how many times do I have to say one Flavor!! My friend ordered the French toast which was actually an apple cake, would have been nice to know that.After the food was served our waiter never came back to see if we were OK. Had to ask someone else for the check. Ambience is always great but I could have brought my own food and been just as happy. Read more Alex our server was amazing very knowledgeable about the menu.

Overall 10 out of 10 experience the server can make the guest feel comfortable and experience enjoyable. Read more Nate provided great service and the food recommendations were outstanding  Read more We were recommended to come here. We booked for 8.45pm for dinner. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted to sit outside. Yes, dinner overlooking marina on a warm evening meant it was an easy choice.
We were quickly told the kitchen was closing in 9 minutes so needed to order quickly. This didn‚Äôt bother us until the waiting staff ( 5 min of us arriving) started dragging chairs and tables to clear the decking. We now know that all outside activity needs to be cleared by 10pm due to laws for the local residents. Of course they needed to abide by the law, but the way in which the waiting staff made no effort to do this quietly only made us feel they were shutting and we were in the way.
We ordered our starters and main before the kitchen closed and within 10 min our first dishes arrived, then just before we had even started our main dishes arrived, a man came over dumping our hot dishes on our table and walked off.
We asked to see our waitress and explained we hadn‚Äôt even started our first course and how rude the man was. She said sorry but the kitchen was closed and we needed to take into consideration he didn‚Äôt speak good English. We couldn‚Äôt believe her response. We of course said English was not the barrier here, the actions, mentality of how were were being made to feel was.
So we have 4 dishes, very few tables and chairs left on the decking and made to feel we were just in the way AGAIN!  She went and got her manger, we explained the situation, trying to get a word in he explained the laws of the state and needing to close the decking. He did understand how the whole situation and that of his team had made us feel and said we didn‚Äôt need to pay for anything and that he knew exactly who it was that brought us our 2nd course to quickly and that he was going to deal with him harshly. ( not professional neither needed) he explained that 95% of the time they get it right and tonight they had fallen short.

the food was yummy.  Victor was a wonderful waiter and made great suggestions.  The location, menu, and service are outstanding at Brizo!  The food is prepared t perfection, exceeding my expectations every time!  The shrimp ceviche looked a bit like a mess on the plate. It was very soupy and not as flavorful as it‚Äôs been in the past.

All in all I had a great time! Read more Great neighborhood, Irish pub, with good food, drinks and friendly service. I‚Äôve had the chicken curry, the lamb stew, and the shepherds pie. All good. Will be back.  It was a busy night but inside was not too crowded or loud, and the bartender was very quick with our drinks.  My salmon dinner was delicious, and I eat a lot of salmon. Cooked just right, as were the vegetables.  My husband had the lamb stew, but it was more like a soup...he said it was very tasty, but he would have liked to have had chunks of vegetables (carrots and potatoes) in it as it was just a lot of meat.  The apple pie was great and a generous dessert.  I had hoped to have a truly authentic Irish coffee, and although it tasted very good, it had whipped cream on top and a straw.  It really should just have been  heavy cream floated on top, so that one can sip through the cream, getting a mustache of the cold cream, and getting that wonderful combination of the cold cream and the hot whiskey/coffee together.

Had a great time at brunch but unfortunately we didn't realize the brunch menu was ONLY on Sundays.  We're going to plan better for next month and will definitely be back!  Auld Fella marries ‚Äúelegance‚Äù with ‚ÄúIrish pub‚Äù.  Tasteful nods to Irish poets and pop culture, luxurious but modern decor, and a full backlit bar, it has culture and personality. Not the kelly-green personality of your everyday Patty‚Äôs Pub, but an ambiance that begs a romantic date or a return visit when your family is in town. The classy atmosphere is why I initially reached out to the very-Irish manager, Jane, to see if I could use the venue to celebrate the life of my own very-Irish mother. For that reason and a million others, I will be visiting for years to come.  

The food is astounding. You probably don‚Äôt often see critics raving about Irish cuisine‚Äîbut Auld Fella elevates traditional dishes and adds a unique flair. The shepherd‚Äôs pies are textured and sumptuous, the kick of the Malay curry reminds you of Ireland‚Äôs rich history, the sandwiches with their crisped ciabatta are all so flavorful it‚Äôs impossible to choose one (though I recommend the Portobello). Only the drinks could distract me from the food. The ‚ÄúAuld Fashioned‚Äù has more spunk than any I‚Äôve tasted in Los Angeles, and the warm, thick cream of the Irish whiskey is as comforting as a hug.  

Maybe what makes the Auld Fella Irish whiskey so special is the way the bartender patiently warms my mug with hot water before he crafts the beverage. This gesture is just one small expression of the Auld Fella‚Äôs genuine culture of hospitality and warmth. I felt this every step of the way planning my event with the super-friendly Jane and the team. They rescheduled their staff appreciation day to accommodate my timing, they worked with me for weeks to plan, perfect, and print our menu, they ensured the food was neatly presented and warm, and they ensured I had a drink in hand during the event itself.  

Despite opening their doors just a few months before the pandemic, the Irish transplants that founded Auld Fella have built an LA treasure and an authentic ode to Ireland that would make my late mother eve Read more Loved it! Such flavorful food and a fun setting. We tried a range, Sunday Roast Lamb, Salmon Rushdie sandwich, Vegan Shepherd‚Äôs Pie and Fish & Chips. Ellie, our server was so good and made the dinner fun.

Planta Cocina, a hidden gem nestled in Marina del Rey, California, has quickly become a go-to destination for those seeking innovative and delicious vegan cuisine. My recent visit did not disappoint.

While I cannot comment on the full menu, I was thoroughly impressed by the vegan cheesecake I had for dessert. This delectable treat was a perfect balance of creaminess, sweetness, and tang, showcasing the restaurant's ability to recreate classic flavors without compromising on taste or ethics.

The presentation of the cheesecake was equally impressive, adding to the overall dining experience. It was clear that the chefs at Planta Cocina take pride in their craft, ensuring that every dish is both visually appealing and incredibly satisfying.

If you're looking for a truly exceptional vegan dining experience, I highly recommend visiting Planta Cocina. Their commitment to quality, innovation, and sustainability makes them a standout in the local culinary scene.

A Symphony for the Senses: A Night at Planta Cocina

Planta Cocina in Marina del Rey isn't just a restaurant; it's an experience for the senses.  Stepping through the doorway on a recent Monday evening, a wave of warmth, both figurative and literal from the hostess's smile, washed over me.  I was guided to my favorite spot, booth number 11, secured with the ease of an OpenTable reservation (highly recommended!), nestled in the heart of this beautifully decorated haven.  The space itself was a symphony of thoughtful design ‚Äì airy enough for easy conversation yet intimate enough to feel like a hidden gem.

But the true star of the show emerged with the arrival of the Monday night special: Maki Monday.  For a mere $27, a seemingly endless parade of maki creations began its delightful march to my table.  Each bite was a revelation, a symphony of textures and flavors that played on the palate like a well-rehearsed orchestra.  The Sunset Roll, a vibrant explosion of sweet potato, jicama, pistachio, and Meyer lemon, was a burst of sunshine on a plate.  The Torched and Pressed, filled with the luxurious embrace of avocado and a touch of miso truffle glaze, offered a decadent whisper of indulgence.

However, the undisputed champion of the evening was a fiery masterpiece: the Dragon Roll.  This marriage of tempura, broccoli, spinach, avocado, and spicy unagi sauce was a captivating dance of heat and coolness, a perfect harmony that left me wanting more.  Seven orders later, with a contented sigh, I surrendered to the sheer delight of it all.

Planta Cocina's magic, however, extends far beyond its delectable fare. My server, Yessenia A, was the embodiment of culinary expertise.  Her attentiveness was a masterclass in service, a silent symphony of anticipation and fulfillment, ensuring my every need was met without ever being intrusive.

My partner and I saw Dover Sole on the online menu and  thought ‚ÄúOh,a French restaurant!‚Äù
We arrived and walked down 19 stairs- a bit daunting for me and I was surprised there was no elevator.  My knees are shot- suffice to say it was very difficult; but we were willing to continue and give L‚ÄôAvenue a try.
The wine was very good(Daou); the burrata salad was fresh; the Dover Sole was rubbery and over cooked.  Extremely disappointing.

Great food, music and ambience.  This is very good place to have dinner dance & fun
Also excellent reasonable prices‚Ä¶
Lets go dance again‚Ä¶  We went there in a party of ten for my daughters graduation. We were all amazed at how good the food was. Service was excellent also. I cant wait to go again.  We have been to this restaurant several times and it is by far our favorite spot in Glendale. Everything from food, entertainment, ambiance, staff is top notch!  Our first impression was of the time of day, and the patrons at the location; the music was too loud. We could not hear our waitress nor her us. There were small children and elderly there. It would have been great for the evening but not noon on Mother's Day. Our waitress seemed new as she did not explain the dishes or ask the right questions. I have a health issue and can not eat certain foods. I ordered the Dutch pancake, not knowing it came with fruit on top, and I was asked if I wanted any toppings. This, to me, suggested that no toppings came with it unless requested. I selected unbaked or cooked apples, as this would make me ill. I received the pancake topped with fruit, which was perfect; I was not told that is how it would be served even after I asked. However, the apples were cooked into the pancake, something I mentioned to her I could not tolerate. I had to pick them out, but I paid extra for them being there; it was very disappointing. 
I gather the restaurant is new, and it was obvious some of the servers and hostess were new as they were not very knowledgeable about their positions or the dynamics of the restaurant.
I would give it another try; however, perhaps not if the music during the day continued to be loud. You can't carry on a conversation with anyone. 
Regarding recommendations, yes, for the food quality and the price, but only that. In their late twenties, my sons did not find the music appropriate either. Read more This is my new favorite spot. It combines everything I love: food, music, alcohol, energetic environment.  Excellent Restaurant with great food and service.  Read more initially, when we walked in, everything was great. We had ordered drinks, I had asked for my go to drink, however after receiving the incorrect drink order, the bartender had claimed that I in fact was incorrect and we should‚Äôve ordered it a different way.

It took us 50min  to receive the house bread (which was just breadsticks with dip) and 1hr 10min to receive the bone marrow which we had just ended up giving to the table next to us because they had been waiting 2hrs for their orders.

En revanche tr√®s bruyant ‚Ä¶ comme partout en un usa ;)  Charcoal is one of my favorite restaurants in the Marina Del Rey/Venice area! The food is consistently delectable! The service is 5-stars! Thank you for another great meal!!  Food was excellent.. Steak just came out room temperature. . Should have been on hot plate and brought as soon as it dropped  Hadn‚Äôt been in a while and left very impressed and satisfied with the quality, preparation and presentation of the food.  Every dish was unique snd delicious.  Server was personable, knowledgeable and helped us order the appropriate amount of dishes for the table.  Honestly can‚Äôt wait to get back and try more dishes.  The Bison Ribeye was the star main, but don‚Äôt skip the lamb rib starters or the deserts. Read more Charcoal is the gemstone of neighborhood gems. We‚Äôve been coming here since it opened and have never had had anything other than a fabulous meal. The open grill is legendary, the meats offered are the finest and the grilled veggies and sides are wonderful. And to top it off, the place runs like a Swiss watch, the young manager a true professional. Read more What a perfect night! The food was extraordinary amd nothing like anywhere else yet so comfortable and unpretentious. Chef Josiah ; you hit a home run with this one. Thank you!! My absolute favorite place. Read more Our first words as we were walking out: Probably wouldn't ever come back. 

The meat was cooked perfectly and tasted really good, and the salad was also delicious. We probably should have just stuck with that. The majority of the rest wasn't really anything special. I don't think I'll ever pay that much for a single baked potato again. Service throughout the restaurant was solid but we couldn't help but think our specific server was having a rough/down day. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and since the food took awhile to come out and it took a little awhile to get each order in, we weren't even able to get a dessert ordered because our babysitters time was running out and we needed to get home. So all in all, we dropped over $300 for a beautiful steak and salad, pretty good mushrooms, fries, and crab, a mediocre experience, a somewhat disappointing potato and lamb ribs (they were mostly fat) and we didn't even get a dessert. I left feeling like that money could have gone better elsewhere. Also, I know it's kind of out of their control, but those bright lights across the street were annoying and nearly gave me a migraine. Read more Great food and great service. Ordered rib eye and bison with the baked potato and broccolini. Will definitely return!  I love Charcoal.  I just took my parents to celebrate my dad‚Äôs birthday.  The food was delicious as always.  We sat in the back outdoor patio which is perfect for this time of year.  They have outdoor heaters but we didn‚Äôt need them.  As always it was a lovely experience.  The staff was very accommodating and the food was delicious.  Thank you Charcoal! Read more Overall an odd experience. Food was just OK. $10 for overdone sourdough and butter was not the best introduction to things.  Beef tartare was under-seasoned and the meat was chopped  surprisingly unevenly and while one wants there to be a toothsome feel to each bite, you don't want a tartare to be chewy. It was unclear what cut was used,  but doubtful that it was filet. Chopped salad was fine. Nothing special/exciting. Hanger steak was undercooked but tasty. Small portion for the price. Avocado pesto tagliatelle was un-notable in every way except that the pasta was cooked slightly past a satisfying al dente. Steak fries were very good as were the mushrooms for the sides. Noise level was extremely high. Decor was strange and lacked any kind of discernible theme or cohesion. Industrial concrete walls with weird art murals and pieces that had zero flow. Front hostess' were lovely and warm in welcoming us. Accommodated a request for a different table than the one to which we were originally led. Request a booth if possible. Confusing service - no one actually said that they were our server and we had to flag down someone to take our order after our drink order was taken. The person who took our drink order and appeared to be our server, and brought our initial drinks never came to the table again.  They really seem to go crazy for a house made vinegar ""I put it on everything!"" which we didn't love.  They have a 3 condiment container that sits on each table. The sauces were fine, a chimichurri, a housemade steak sauce, and one other. It takes up a lot of space on a 2 top, and then in addition, they bring over that vinegar.  We felt very crowded at the table and were happy to leave without considering dessert. Overall, too expensive for the taste and the experience. Likely will not return. Read more Read more Always a great experience here and food is delic  Not a real steak restaurant! The only steak sauce option is a tomato bernaise if you want a fillet. Bone-in fillet -no, a larger fillet cut than 8oz -no, grass-fed -no. So maybe have a seafood option instead? Ended up with a not-so-fresh tasting salmon butt-end for $40 that should never have been served to a customer. So how about the bar scene? The first margarita we tried was so sweet it must have had 50% agave syrup. The second one tasted like it had only half an oz of tequila so had to ditch that too and just get the tequila neat with lime wedges on the side. Given its common ownership by Citrin‚Äîan excellent restaurant‚Äîwe expected way better. This place needs a re-think. Read more Can't believe I've lived in Venice for so long and haven't tried this place! My waiter was so kind, I'm definitely coming back again soon!  Great overall experience! Chef De Cuisine Everette‚Äôs food was fantastic and the service by Sam was unforgettable. 10/10 experience  This was a perfect date night place,  it was casual, no pressure type of atmosphere and the food , yet quite pricy , was delicious. I really went for the oysters and smoky duck ribs. Erica , our server, was engaging, funny, and very professional. This neighborhood restaurant is a new favorite. Also, the wine list is extensive. We had a beautiful Super Tuscan. Yummers! Read more Such good food and really attentive service.  In fact, every single person wlthat interacted with us (about 5 people) were amazing.  Food is very good; Service is spotty; the place is noisy -- some people like the ""liveliness"" of it  -- but it's not easy to carry on a conversation with that much noise.  Great restaurant, great food but can‚Äôt hear anything as it‚Äôs super loud  Fish was nice but undercooked. Vegetables too salty. This does not come close to what is expected from Josiah Citrin.  Perhaps it was an off night‚Ä¶ but very disappointing meal.  Service was very good and the server gave us good recommendations. We enjoyed the food tremendously. So glad we went there and shared family style with our good friends.

One thing though is that they charged us for the corkage but on their website in the FAQs, it says corkage is $35 for the 1st 2 bottles that you bring. But it also says that if you purchase one wine off of their list then they will waive the corkage fee.  We brought this to their attention and their manager said they would make an exception and remove the charge. This is the only part that we were very unhappy about. That is not good business. Read more Read more Terrific food, service and staff. Summer beans were a winner while you can never go wrong with the bone-in ribeye. Fries were sinful and Elisa our server couldn‚Äôt have been more pleasant and accommodating Read more I wish I‚Äôd found this place sooner. Every menu item was delicious. We started with the lamb ribs which were smoky and falling off the bone tender. Followed up with the beet and mushroom tartare, ahi tartare and beef tartare. The beet tartare was earthy and sweet. The ahi tartare was sweet due to the watermelon juice and tart from the pickled watermelon rind; a welcome change from the usual ahi tartare. The beef tartare was smoky and and the proper texture which made for a very pleasant experience. Our daughters shared the ribeye; one of them said it was one of the best steaks she‚Äôs ever had. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare bordering on the rare side (we abhor overdone steak). I had the stone crab special. A half pound translated to 4 large claws served on a bed of ice. Not quite as good as Joe‚Äôs Stone Crab but pretty close. My husband had a second serving of ahi tartare as his entree because it was that good. We finished the meal with a chocolate piece of heaven that was light and chocolatey. Service was friendly, warm and efficient. Will definitely return.

The one reason I didn't give them a 5 is that we were there on a Sunday for brunch at 11AM and they were out of a bunch of things, including smoked salmon and MILK. We wanted lattes and tea with milk and the response was -- ""we only have half-n-half, is that OK?""  Um, no.  Not OK. How do you run out of milk? We pointed out to our waiter that the restaurant was next door to Trader Joe's and they sold milk there. Why not just run over and get some milk? At the time we were there, we saw only one other party. The waiter mumbled something about something but no milk. So, we had brunch without lattes and tea, and the restaurant missed out on some sales and an extra star on the rating they could have had with a simple purchase of a $1.50 quart of milk from the grocery store next door. Very strange way of doing business. Read more Just ok. They do not have a beverage menu with prices so you can either ‚Äúrisk it for the biscuit‚Äù or ask. Either way, it‚Äôs off putting.

While I prefer Filet, the skirt steak was amazing. We got the sauce on the side as my date has occasionally issues with some sauces, and frankly I kind of liked it that way, I had a choice of how much to use.

The large table has a fire pit in the middle which is kind of cool during cold days but we were surpised there is no cover over it when not in use (and no one suggested there would be one), and we lost a lot of real estate on the table.  The staff was very nice, but we did not give a five star for service because it took a while for the waiter to come around each time, he was extremely nice but he appeared to have been double staffed as the bar tender as well because he tended to the drinks in between hence took a long time to get to us.

As for the food, well, our eyes were  bigger than out stomachs, but it was all so good! The shining stars of our selections were the Beet Salad With Roasted Papaya (genius!!); the Pizza Margherita; and the pasta special, Fetuccine Monte Bianco --OMG!!!!

Read more Food was good. Service not great. Took 1/2 hour to take order. Got our food, order was wrong had to wait longer for food and to even get napkins and refills. Overall a 2 hour experience that wasn‚Äôt necessary. Read more I loved how friendly and helpful the service was - kudos!  We ordered the Family Platter and wow - it was a lot of food and there wasn't a meat in the sampling we didn't like.  Everything was really tender, the brisket and short rib were falling off the bone.  Really reasonable for great bbq at $125 for 4 people.  We were celebrating 2 bdays, and they gave all of us Jolly Rancher shots (so candy-like, what was in that??).  The only challenge was trying to hear each other in what was a loud, echoey room; the TVs on the other side didn't help.  But otherwise we enjoyed the casual vibe.  Highly recommend. Read more Really great food, party of 8 & everyone was happy! Very good service. Definitely coming back.  Vinny at the bar is amazing. Best part of the night.  We made a reservation on Open Table and were seated right away. The restaurant was packed during prime dinner rush, but our server managed to keep everything running smoothly. Our drinks arrived promptly, and our food arrived within 15 minutes.

The brisket burrito was absolutely delicious. The cheese on the outside of the burrito was a perfect touch. The kids also enjoyed their meals. Read more Service was so bad. They ran out of silver ware and it took 1 hour and a half to get our drinks  The smell of smoked meat is the first thing you get as you approach the restaurant.  Exactly as it should be for a real barbecue joint.

The decor has an indoor outdoor picnic feel.

In addition to the excellent barbecue (which can be had as appetizers, tacos, sandwiches, or platters) they have a full bar. We got there during happy hour.

Service was good with the reservation we made in open table having our table ready as we arrived.

We tried a couple of appetizers (chips with queso and a soft pretzel, and  tacos!  All super tasty:  We also tried their micro brew beers and a margarita to go with the tacos!

Overall an excellent place to hang out with friends after work. Read more They have ruined the place.  This restaurant used to have great food and management.  Every time I would go there, either the manager or one of the chefs would come out to check in the tables. Now it has gone downhill.  Our party ordered their famous loaded baked potato which usually has crispy onions and a lot of brisket on it, bbq sauce, ranch etc..  this time all that came out was a baked potato with a dime size piece of brisket and nothing else. I was so upset that I didn‚Äôt take photos. I asked for the manager twice. Nobody came.  Even the waitress was really embarrassed by the food their kitchen sent out and the way the manager ignored their loyal,  returning customers.
Before this place was so busy that on the weekends it was very hard to get a table without prior reservations. When I walked in I was surprised by the amount of open tables. Now I know why Read more Craft by Smoke was disappointing considering the reviews on Yelp! Service was the worst part of the meal considering how outstanding their previous reviews were. Our waitress lied to us about a drink being smoked then saying sorry there‚Äôs no chips to smoke an old fashion. Gave us dirty plates for a family meal (with cheese still on the plates). The food came out a little cold. Overall not a great experience from start to finish. Read more Read more Fun if you are just looking for a place for bite and sports game.  Unfortunately, the food was cold and generally not very flavorful.  The food was fine. Not amazing, but decent. The service was lacking. The waiters were nice, but they didn‚Äôt come around often. I had to go inside to ask for silverware because our food was getting cold waiting for someone to come by. The family at the table next to us had to go inside and ask someone to come get their drink orders. Read more Fun ambiance, loud enough for kids, and good food! Will recommend and be back.  Food ~ Fair. All meals were salty.
Service ~ Nice wait staff. Did not pick up finished dishes and sat at table until we left. 
Price ~ Fair for these days. 
Will likely not return. Read more Good service and ambiance , definitely worth coming back  We did not get a chance to try the food as we were seated and then left unacknowledged for over 25 minutes. We asked three waiters if they were our waiters or if they could help us, but they responded either that they were not our waiters or that they would find out (they never returned with answers). We just got up to leave after it was clear we were not going to get service, and I don't believe anyone even noticed when we left. This was on a Sunday afternoon with a half full restaurant. Read more Fabulous service. Excellent food. Very enjoyable. We had a nice time.  Bad the service was bad and the food cold and super expensive for what we got  Great food and beer the customer service is was amazing  Read more It was hot and I‚Äôd like some AC but that‚Äôs my only complaint  Too hot and the service was very rude.  But the food was awesome.  The quality of the meat is fantastic, and that is all we had, as we're doing the Carnivore diet. We will be back.  It's a meat eater's paradise.  I was there with a friend for lunch and ordered a brisket.  Really great flavor!  Service was very good.  The place wasn't crowded, so I don't know what the noise level is like when it's full, but for lunch it was perfect for talking.  I'm taking my wife there tonight. Read more Amazing experience from unique drinks to the ‚Äúto die for‚Äù brisket and ambiance. Went with 8 family members and we loved it!  We were a party of 12 (4 kids) celebrating my dad‚Äôs birthday. Our server Jennifer M was amazing! She had great knowledge in menu items and even gave us her personal recommendations which we appreciated. She maintained a positive attitude and answered all our questions throughout the night. Despite a packed and busy Friday night, there were no issues or delays. Our food and drinks came out as expected. Will definitely be back. Thank you, Jennifer! Read more The server was great & the restaurant was understaffed but Jesse N , did a great job. The food however was cold & had no flavor. I‚Äôve been to Thai location and have had better experiences. However maybe it‚Äôs not smart to go on a Tuesday when they do not have a full staff, my tri tip was fully gray and had no flavor as well as my street corn and colored carrots were flavorless.  Do better Smoke N Fire Read more Have been to this location a few times this is by far the worst time we have been. We were celebrating my husbands promotion at work and we were specific about what we wanted. I got the Birria tacos which didn‚Äôt have much meat more cheese and cilantro. He order the brisket and the pastrami. We asked for nothing on the meat. It came out with peppers on top. The fries were so dry and we really could eat them. They seemed old and over cooked. I have to say it was disappointing to say the least. Maybe we try a different location after this. Read more Good was delicious, drinks were tasty, service was super friendly (server was Kylie), staff was accommodating‚Ä¶everything was terrific!

Stout and porter beer were great. Tasty hamburger and fries. Great value.  Tanya was our server and she went above and beyond to make the experience what it was! Thankful to her!  Great service, nice large family booth, good food and deals.  Arrived 3 minutes early for Open Table reservation and was told 10-15 minutes wait. What‚Äôs the point of reserving and being on time? Appetizers came long before cutlery. Had to request extra sauce - pasta was very very dry. $120 for a couple apps, 3 plates of pasta, no alcohol is too high. Super slow to get boxes and bill. All of that said, worst of all was having the parking validated and then trying to leave the parking garage and finding out it didn‚Äôt work/wasnt done right and owing an extra $9 to leave. All in all a poor experience. Can I claw back part of the tip or bill and cover the parking? Read more We loved the tri-tip salads. The tri-tip was a meal in itself, the salad was sizeable and the dressings were tasty. The server was attentive and very friendly.  Had a great birthday celebration here. The service was great, the food was delicious, and the server managed our table of eightÔøº very efficiently.  Music extremely loud.  Asked to have it lowered.  They said they did but still difficult to converse with lunch friends.  We enjoyed the drinks. The food was ok. 2 of my friends had to return their food because the fish was not fresh and the steak was too salty. But the desserts, the pizza, the drinks and the chill sports vibe is pretty good. Reasonable prices! Read more The ziti was not made by an Italian.  - Probably a Mexican.  Even with a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes. I have never had this happen at any other OpenTable location. After waiting, we were told the table was ready, but that was not true because they still had to clean the table. As a result, we waited another 5 minutes. I won't reserve a table at this BJ's again. Once seated, our waitress was very responsive and a great server. Too bad the host made us wait. Read more Read more I've been to a few different BJ's before and this is a decent one. It is at a great location in Glendale for sure. The restaurant looks great walking in but the tables are a little bit sticky. There were also a few bugs flying around even though we were sat in the middle of the restaurant. Server wasn't that attentive. No biggie though. Solid restaurant still but not the best BJ's I've visited. Read more We had a reservation for 6pm and we were not seated until 6:20pm, with 9 people. There were open tables while we waited, standing. The restrooms were very dirty. The floors were wet, they were out of toilet paper in some stalls and out of papertowels. Not sanitary. The waiter we had was nice and came around frequently, but did not always respond immediately to requests. It was busy so we had some grace for him. Read more Great customer service, really attentive and fast.  our server was great. was very attentive and was quick with refills. the overall staff was friendly.  BJs at Glendale is one of our day our Ute places to dine in. Happy to go back there again!  The waitress kept pulling her mask down every time she came to the table so she could talk - defeating the entire purpose.  Only this one waitress - I‚Äôve been eating out regularly and this one is the only, but ridiculous, and the manager saw it even jokes with other customers while she was doing it and did nothing.  Do not go to this one, if any restaurant will have a Covid spread it will be this ome because of this one waitress.  Gross and ridiculous. Read more We enjoyed ourselves very much. Everything was delicious and our server Noelle was great. Glad to be able to dine in again.  So happy to eat out again.  Thank you for being ultra safe  We were there early before a play, so I can't really speak to the noise level during peak hours. I have dietary restrictions, and they bent over backwards to accommodate me. the food was very good and reasonably priced. The Happy Hour drinks were super cheap. Read more This restaurant was not up to par. Positive: We had a 12:30pm reservation and was seated immediately. The children meals came out promptly. Negative: Myself and the other adults waited over 45 minutes for calamari, a sandwich, wings and brussel sprouts. The restaurant was not crowded. The waiter just kept saying, ""It's coming!"" We didn't want to make a scene. By the time the food arrives, the adults had to take EVERYTHING to go.  We had a 2:30pm show for the children and ended up being late  and hungry :(. Pretty sad day. Read more Read more Even though I had a reservation they still made me wait 15 minutes to be seated. Server was not familiar with the menu and needed us to find the photos of the items in the menu so he could input it. Read more Our waiter was great. We had a total of 14 people and everyone was happy.  First server was great. Then she went on a break with the replacement seeming very friendly. Until we waited for 30 minutes for anyone to get flagged down for refills. Then another 30 minutes to get to go boxes and a bill. Made a really good experience pretty poor. Read more The service was great. Polite people made conversation Martin , Albaro and our waitress attend all our needs to make my daughter's dinner a beautiful night. Thank you they made it more special. Loved that my daughters dessert had a lighted candle thank you. Read more My group loved our experience! We had thought it would be noisy, but it was very quiet! The menu was great with many options and the food was prepared very well. It was the simple preparation that impressed me. My salmon was perfect - very tasty and not smothered in sauces. We had an online coupon and received a free choice of appetizer. We chose the avocado egg rolls and thought they were great!  I also joined BJ's Rewards and we received a yummy pizookie for dessert. The service was excellent! The server (Seth B) was amazing! He was very patient as we decided amongst many options and helpfully answered questions and made a few substitutions. The food arrived quickly and Seth was there checking in on us. In fact, he told me about joining the Rewards program and about our free  pizookie. We will definitely go back there again and I have already recommended the Glendale BJ's to other friends. Read more It was father's day so they were busy. They got my order long and it was a long wait but it was all understandable. I would still go back.  Food was rushed and not good, we were still eating and talking when waiter just dropped bill on table didn‚Äôt offer desert and mentioned we had a birthday guest, the waiter acknowledged but did not come back with pizookie at the end of our dinner. I‚Äôve eaten at other BJ‚Äôs food was good hot and fresh. Also alcohol beverages was more watery and juice as well as left over pieces of Im guessing fruit (strawberries) from other drinks that were blended before. One of our guest meals was ready less than 10min of ordering and they ordered last but was the first and only plate to have on the table for about 15min before everyone else (awkward). We will not visit again! Read more BJ's food is really good. We stopped after we saw a play nearby. I always get the quinoa peruvian bowl with Salmon and my husband got the grilled Salmon. Great food. The Dodgers game was on so that was a nice treat. The place is noisy but that's to be expected at family restaurant. We booked our table through open table so there was no wait. Surprise. Read more The food and service is great. Nice place to go for lunch  Restaurants in this building offer convenient indoor validated parking, and the broad menu of BJ's delivers options that please most any group. We arrived early and were promptly seated. Service was attentive on this busy Saturday evening. Food was served hot and tasty. Surroundings can get noisy especially with big games running on the many TVs. We are sports fans so the action was not detracting from the good dinner experience. We'll definitely return.

It‚Äôs amazing how through all these years that Los Angeles , or maybe the whole world have gone through so many ups and downs like 911, and much bigger than anything else was the Covid pandemic that has impacted so many restaurants. While so many restaurants surrounding Toscanova have close all through the years, this one has remained in tact.
Coming back to this restaurant post every challenges has been so great specially that they were able to maintain is classic way of making their place always enjoyable to dine at in terms of food, service and ambiance.

Their white fish is also very good!

I tend to go back here over and over through the years whenever I‚Äôm in Century City.

We enjoy the overall vibe. It is like sitting in a private library with music where you can still have a conversation. The space is brighter, with a variety of seating options. The clientele was younger than we were, but we felt very welcome. 

Food: they offer cheese and snacks along with offering food from the sushi restaurant Jinpachi, which is next door. This is quite a perk, as my wife and I ordered the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna both times we went and really enjoyed it. 

Wine: we tried different things each time, but we like imports. Standouts were the Besson white Burgundy and the Ch√¢teau Tour Grand Faurie, Saint-Emilion Grand Cru.

Check out premium Endo""s tempura in where our first-branch in U.S.A.","A symphony of flavors and textures served with quintessential Japanese care. It's like being in Kyoto.  Tempura Endo is an entirely Japanese - and entirely Japanese - presentation of tempura, which Americans know as the kind of chewy mix of shrimp and vegetables that you might order at any Japanese restaurants.  Tempura Endo isn't that.  Instead, it's a celebration of a very precise and delicate art of cooking, with a whole variety of fish, shrimp, and vegetables served fresh and hot with a light, crispy exterior.  Mixed in with the highest quality sashimi and other Japanese delicacies, Tempura Endo gives a dining experience that you simply can't find in many places in the US (I've been to Tempura Endo in Kyoto, as well - it's hard to say which one is better).  It's not inexpensive, but it's worth saving up for a fantastic experience. Read more Tempura like no other.  Fresh, light and creative.  And very good.  Food was very good but be very prepared for the most expensive meal of your life! We weren‚Äôt offered cocktails so, we all drank green tea, which was fine.

The tempura here is amazing. This is the only tempura restaurant on the entire West coast. I believe that the only other tempura restaurant in America of similar quality is the only tempura restaurant in New York (Tempura Matsui). Other than these 2 places, tempura of this standard can only be found at the best tempura restaurants in Japan. The batter is perfect. The oil is pure and just the right temperature. The cooking time is just right. The result is the thinnest layer of crispiness, nothing at all like most Americans are used to. The underlying ingredients (whether vegetables, shrimp, scallops, uni) are top quality and perfectly fresh. True, the restaurant is expensive, but to see how perfect (and greaseless) tempura can be, Temura Endo is the place. Read more Amazing dempura selection. One and only. Service was awesome.

Decent tempura, good non-tempura dishes, excellent service, but perhaps not the extraordinary experience expected at this price point.

They should have done this before the guest arrived as there was nothing to look at except for the big chef with the black mask who did not engage with us and only came out to check if the oil was heated and kept going to the back.

Read more Unlike any tempura you've had elsewhere. If you're a fan of this dish, this is the place to go. The coating is lacy and barely covers the food. And so crunchy. The place to sit is at the bar as the chef hands it over to you the instant it's done so it loses none of its texture. The chef has found ways to even make uni tempura and mozzarella cheese tempura!

The reason for the poor rating narrows down to a 18% hidden service fee they autmatically add to your bill. When questioned if it was TIP fees, they said no it was just a service fee but did not explain what type of service they considered the fee to cover and that tips were still greatly appreciated. I've dined at my fair share of restaurants and all are forthcoming with up to 5% additional fee's to cover employee benefits. Word to management, if you expect to gain loyal return customers and stay in business, maybe be upfront with your intent of extra service fee's or just increase your prices to compensate. We did the decent thing by leaving our wonderful waitress an additional 20% tip for a party of 2, but left fealing we were beyond shafted! :-( I am hesitent to recomend this place to others and would definetly advise them of these fee's if I do so they are not suprised.

We got good service with the food and a good sommelier who knew the wine collection well.  A wonderful steak house.  Wine service and excellent sommelier service add to the class.  Live music on most weekend days adds to the atmosphere.  Food is generally excellent.  Background noise is a bit loud at times, but that's the only downside we've experienced on several occasions.

We've been to most similar restaurants in the LA area (Flemings, Mortons, Mastro's, Cut, Taylor's, and multiple others), and Bourbon Steak has the most class, is always friendly and overall the best ongoing quality. Read more This was our first time at this restaurant. We thought we‚Äôd give it a try for our anniversary and the food was awful. I ordered the lobster pot pie - for $169 it was horrible! The lobster was overcooked and chewy and tthere was really no flavor in the sauce - couldn‚Äôt taste or smell the brandy in the sauce. They served it table side and put the pastry crust on the bottom and poured it on top which made it soggy. We also tried the Wagyu tagliatelle pasta for the appetizer ‚Äì the server raved about how delicious it was. Again, it was nothing special. There was gristle on the steak in the pasta as well as the sauce had no flavor other than garlic. My husband ordered the ribeye which was over seasoned - for a nice piece of meat there‚Äôs no need to over season it.  The server never asked us how the food was as she probably knew we weren‚Äôt happy. The only thing that was great was the watermelon sorbet. We will not be returning. No value for the price charged.

Read more From the moment we walked in, the staff made sure we had a top-notch and pleasurable experience. The hostess observed I walked in before my friend and asked his name so she could later guide him to the right table. The servers offered great suggestions and adapted to our changes with grace. It was a treat to have the sommelier's assistance in selecting a great bottle of French wine, which was also half-price on Monday! Of course, all of the food was delicious but I really enjoyed the mushroom side dish.

Service, cocktails, and food are always spectacular.  This was our first time dining at Bourbon Steak , the service was outstanding and the food was excellent. As we sat, looking over both wine and food menus, they served duck fat fried fries with three different seasonings and sauces. All were very good!  Our opening appetizer was a dozen fresh oysters and for our entree We ordered an american wagyu bone-in New York steak, black truffle Mac and cheese, and saut√©ed mushrooms with garlic slices. We enjoyed this sipping glasses of wine from recommended bottle of Syrah. For dessert, cheesecake with three types of berries. All so very delicious. Read more I‚Äôve had incredible meals at Michael Mina steak restaurants in the past - Bourbon Steak in Nashville and STRIPSTEAK in Las Vegas. This experience in LA was not up to par.

We were seated next to very loud regulars, despite the restaurant being mostly empty for our 5:45pm reservation and clearly stating we were there on a rare date night as parents of 5 younger children.

The food was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù - my cowboy ribeye was decent but I‚Äôve made better at home. Truffle Mac & Cheese was the star, but the broccoli side was barely cooked and lacked flavor. Bone marrow accompaniment was just okay, we‚Äôve had better. Duck spring rolls were also mid and chewy.

We were just underwhelmed. We arrived during happy hour but were told it wasn‚Äôt honored unless we were sitting at the bar. I totally get that, but at a restaurant of this level, you‚Äôd expect the server to still put in your order. I was clear that I wanted a Barrel Aged Old Fashioned, and she basically just said no I can‚Äôt get one and kept trying to sell us wine because it was Wine Monday. She was confused about Old Fashioneds even being on the happy hour menu and thought it was just half off wines, but it‚Äôs clearly on the online happy hour menu. She never checked and never reported back like she said she would.

We still ordered old fashioneds with dinner 20 mins later and I said I‚Äôd like another after the appetizer when my steak arrived. We talked about this more than once, but the server completely forgot about the 2nd cocktail and seemed to be spread thin across multiple tables that were now seated about an hour after we first sat down. It takes that long to get your meal. She even apologized for the wait and said she‚Äôd bring some truffle bread in the meantime, which lacked any flavor at all. Zero butter or truffle flavor, not even warm. Basically just a bland, dry muffin.

Not at all the experience we hoped for with a $400+ check. Read more The food and service were both great. Some kinks for our large party of 11. One of our 16 oz Domenico ribeye steak  order was missed so there was a delay. Another Domenico Ribeye steak order still had the twine on so guest was grossed out by it. My free 3 hours valet validation became invalid after being there for 3.5 hours so I still had to pay the $20 valet fee for passing the 3 hours limit. They should have told us that so we could have hurried and pay our bill to quickly retrieve our car. They had a live musician playing while we dined plus background music going as the live musician so the noise level was quite loud. It was hard to hear each other talk.

The food was delicious and the drinks were great. The service was impeccable and they staff were attentive. Friday eveing they had live music which was great and added to the ambience. The only misstep in the evening was their complimentary dessert for the birthday occasion. I was embarssed by what was presented, which was a mini cone with a teaspoon of ice cream on top. Definitely not something that was shareable. We were a party of two and almost spent almost $400 for dinner.

I was their celebrating a friend‚Äôs birthday and they went above and beyond in making the occasion special.

Ambiance is quiet and romantic (so if you're here with the person that you love come through)

I had the bouef bourganion with root vegetables, red wine sauce, and I believe it had a white miso sauce. I think that it did make the beef a tad salty but the red wine braised really did help and overall kt was delicious.

My friend had a pizza (tomato sauce, cheese, slices of ham, olives, and basil). The pizza is a personal plate but it's sliced enough that you can share it with two people. That was delicious and I knew it was going to be good because when you enter their restaurant, you see a glowing pizza oven ready to make delicious pizzas.

I chose to park at the Pershing square garage and you just have to walk through an area that has a lot of street wanderers. Out of the restaurants control, but worth noting. Also did not see the valet that was mentioned on the reservation, but I could have missed it. Parking at Pershing square on weeknights was $9 flat fee.

C- at best... 

Please change your bait n switch advertising... 
Taco Tuesday tacos are not the same as menu tacos... even the pictures on the banners show two tortillas for the tacos but they only provide one tortilla that falls apart when you try to enjoy it. Sad. Read more Great food and music, accommodating staff.  The vibe is good!  Bad Bunny on endless replay and very small tacos for Taco Tuesday‚Ä¶I think Tocaya‚Äôs Taco Tuesday is a better deal unless you want to a drink from the bar.  Service was great. They were welcoming and super friendly. Also very attentive and made sure our mimosa glasses were getting refilled.  We came for brunch on a Sunday around 11. It was pretty slow. My friends and I were there for a couple of hours and 90% of the tables were empty the entire time which was fine as it gave us more time to chill and chit chat, but it wasn‚Äôt as happening as other kalaveras locations. Read more It was the worst Mexican food I‚Äôve ever had. We will not come back.  drinks and food was great, the vibe is cool but we just experienced awkwardness with our waiter and he kept forgetting to bring us what we ordered lol and double check your receipt before paying, got charged for something we ordered but never got it brought out to us even tho we let him know lol ü•≤ Read more Everything was amazing, the food was delicious, the service was very thoughtful and overall it was a good time!  Excellent and friendly staff. The food was delicious and fresh. We recommend the birria tacos. I think you‚Äôll need earplugs first the loud music and videos (not my favorite). Good value.  Outstanding food and service!  Everyone was courteous and friendly. Excellent options.  Barbacoa, ceviche, queso fundido and tasty margaritas.  We will return and recommend to family and friends! Read more We had a large family reservation celebrating a grad school graduation, a birthday, and a reunion. The staff did an amazing job keeping the drinks and apps flowing, orders came out quickly and all together, and the literal icing on the cake was that at the end of the meal they brought out desserts (and the celebration) for both the birthday and the graduate. Our server really listened and paid wonderful service. Read more Read more Service was pretty good.  The restaurant was not busy.  I ordered the enchiladas verde.  The menu describes this as served with white meat chicken.  I received entirely dark meat which I did not care for.  It was topped with a bunch of cabbage I would have preferred on the side because it wilts on the warm enchiladas.  The verde sauce was quite tart.  The rice is not traditional Mexican rice but like El Pollo Loco.  No chips and salsa were provided as at the location in Marina del Rey.  Just nothing special.  El Torito is better. Read more Great food and service, can be very loud but it‚Äôs open late  Good meat. Could be more flavor ful. Taco Tuesday a bargain but need better condiments  We celebrated my birthday here and it was a really nice experience. I took my parents and my dad has hearing issues and right away, we realized the sound level would be an issue for him. The staff was so nice and accommodating that they sat us on the patio and turned off the music in that section. It‚Äôs an open air restaurant so we could still hear the music from inside, but quiet enough he could hear our conversation. That was a really nice touch.
The ambience is fun and lively with neon street art, flower walls and blasting salsa and bachata soundtracks - reminds me of my time in Miami, they‚Äôve definitely got a party vibe.
The food is fantastic - my mom had shrimp tacos, I had the Kala burrito (like a California burrito for all the San Diegans out there - top notch!) and my dad who is a carne asada snob LOVED his entree. Guacamole is well executed as well, as are the cocktails - we had a couple rounds of margs and mojitos.
Our server was very sweet and did a good job handling my dad who can be somewhat tricky since he‚Äôs an old curmudgeon- only comment to make on service is that he seemed to be really busy with the tables inside and we could‚Äôve used quicker refreshers on drinks, apps, and check drop time. But he did apologize and note he was taking care of two 8-tops inside so I know he was hustling.
I‚Äôve been to this location as well as the Santa Monica spot and have to say Kalaveras is really solid as a restaurant. I‚Äôm definitely giving them repeat business! Read more Great Service , good atmosphere and energy , üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç  I always love going to Kalaveras! They had a mariachi and the service was GREAT  Best carne asada plate in town. Definitely recommend  Went here with a girlfriend for happy hour, service was fantastic and the food was excellent. We ordered appetizers (quesadilla and taquitos) and a couple of drinks (house margarita and a couple of beers) we were very happy we came here as we got out under $60. The manager came around and was checking on guests and helping out, it was nice to see an establishment where the manager isn‚Äôt sitting in the back and he was actually helping his servers. ÔøºCustomer service here is fabulous! Read more Service was fast, food was amazing! We got a great server as well!  Great service, delicious food and amazing drinks!!  Read more Everything was great. Litterally everything was great from the service to the food to the drinks  The manager was not very accommodating even though I had a reservation and I was celebrating my birthday. I mentioned that to him, and he said that all of the tables were already reserved for other parties. I guess it was a karaoke night. Anyhow, they did end up, putting us in a decent table, and no one of those reservations showed up. It was a bit of a letdown, and they were not very exciting to be around! The server Saul was awesome! And the karaoke woman was super awesome too. The manager was pretty much the worst I've ever met. The bartender was sweet as well. I usually go to the one in Pasadena, but I live really close to this one. I will not be going back. I'll make the drive all the way to Pasadena for them. They are awesome! Read more Great food and drinks! Great for birthdays and girls night out. Service was excellent as well. I would recommend deep cleaning the glasses before serving water.  Delicious and great service! Very appreciative of the servers and their hospitality!  Great taquitos, queso fundido, birria tacos. Margaritas tasty but weak, extremely loud  Really good food, drinks, music, and atmosphere. Service was great. Price is fair. Will be returning again.  Guacamole was good as an appetizer, shrimp enchiladas were amazing. Service was great went for work lunch date and it wasn‚Äôt packed at all.  Great service, great food (although they are often out of soyrizo), decent parking, clean bathrooms.  Right now the restaurant is always freezing though because the owner/manager insists on leaving the door and/or sliding wall open...it's too cold out right now!!  The music is also obnoxiously loud at times...we end up screaming across the table to one another lol = no bueno!

We'll keep coming back but not until it warms up outside...who wants to eat while they're shivering?! Read more Friends Birthday  Food is great (quality and value) - with a full bar.

We arrived early for a 630 reservation and were able to broadly sample from a happy hour menu that was exceptional and extremely kind to our budget (though the dinner pricing is quite reasonable). We had terrific margaritas and were able to experience virtually most of the available tacos. OMG, state of the culinary art! Especially liked the Shrimp, brisket and lamb. Kale salad and ceviche were also outstanding. Now part of our regular dining rotation!  Special kudos to the young server (recently hired) who was friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. She steered us in the right direction on our order and definitely added significant value to the experience! Read more Excellent food and drink. Fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend.  Drinks and food were very good.  Most of the selections were spicy and it seems when you asked for not spicy that wasn‚Äôt an option.  Although when I called I asked and they said most dishes could be made either way.
I was surprised to learn otherwise.  The service was very good.  The noise outside on the street is loud as it across from St John‚Äôs Hospital, so lots of ambulances pass by.
I would go back however some in our party felt it was too spicy for them. Read more The food was excellent and very reminiscent of Border Grill ( especially the chips/salsa/guac) but service was lacking. Host was great and had a table ready for us when we arrived but wait staff was hard to flag down. We waited a long time for her to come by our table initially and had to find her to place order for appetizers and then again to order main course. Runners brought the food out quickly. Read more This is one of our local faves. Only piece of feedback is that the branzino was extremely salty! I wonder if it was a one-off thing (I had next had it before).  The food, as always, was EXCEPTIONAL AND DELICIOUS!

I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar. I ordered two items, one arrived within a few minutes. After about 10 minutes I asked about the second item - the bartender checked and the second item would not be ready before the show so he could either package it to go or cancel the order. I ended up canceling the second item.

As for the food, the crispy chicken was good, and the dumplings were tasty, but the most expensive dish, and the one that I was most looking forward too, the salt & pepper lobster, was waaaaaay over cooked.

I love beef lemongrass and papaya salad. The service is great as well.  The food here is amazing every time we come, they accommodated to someone in our party who had a lot of food allergies.  Little Sister is always good! The shaky shaky beef and shrimp/pork spring rolls never disappoint. Typically we also like the Papaya salad, however we didn‚Äôt care for it this time around.

Cody was a very caring saver  Staff was friendly and helpful but the food was awful. The steak tasted like a tough boot and cooked to hell.  This long-standing gem in Marina del Rey never disappoints to make us feel as though we've left the hustle and bustle of LA behind and escaped to a tropical hideaway.  The atmosphere is casual, but the food is a cut above.  The Colossal Malaysian Prawns are amazing, as is the crab-stuffed salmon, and we love that sandwiches are on the varied menu even at dinner time.  The Jimmy Buffet style band playing in the bar added a fun tone to our experience.  Listed menu prices are reasonable, but beware--you will really be paying 15% more.  Our one pet peeve is a restaurant adding a ""service charge"" to the bill.  The Warehouse's 15% is steep.  We were confused whether this was an included tip (very low) or some other fee (very high).  Our server explained that about 40% of it goes to him, while the rest supports the kitchen staff and other operational expenses.  There is nothing more off-putting than restaurants nickel-and-diming diners with separate additional surprise fees.  While we left a generous tip for our wonderfully attentive server on top of this charge, a fee this high can give diners the impression that they don't need to tip the server further.  Salaries and operational expenses should be paid by the owners and rolled into menu prices behind the scenes, not made a separate responsibility for patrons each time they dine.

Always a great experience my friends and I go once or twice a week at times  I've had Gyu-Kaku in Japan Mainland China and Hong Kong. First time trying it in the US and I like it very much. The price is reasonable and considerably cheap for LA but the food is fantastic. Would recommend. The only thing is it does not have the nori seaweed bbq sauce rice that the stores in other countries have, but the rice here is also good. Read more Read more I'm always a fan. Great food. Cold beer. I was happy  Rice was terribly overcooked, unacceptable from a Japanese restaurant. White rice was so uncooked to the point it resembled mochi. Do NOT eat at this location for the love of god. If you can‚Äôt get simple Japanese white rice right then I have no hope for the rest of your dishes. Read more Too much smoke, crowded and noisyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  My son‚Äôs 18th birthday was great here. Thank you.  Always a great experience
The food is super good and staff nice  The original Japanese bbq experience. Monday night happy hours used to be the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù dinner out, but once you‚Äôve tried it, not much to bring you back again and again. The food quality has diminished and it‚Äôs a little funky at times. Overall, have loved it for many years so maybe I‚Äôve just evolved and Guy-Kaku has not. Read more We got the pre-set meal for six. There was plenty of food for all of us, and it was all delicious. We actually took enough leftovers for a couple of lunches. Parking was easy in the pre-pay lot a few doors down. Read more Experience was fine DineLA deal was good üòû Needs improvement with the service and quality of some of the premade dishes like Karaage  The place feels tired.  The food is real good. Just not sure I‚Äôd go back for a while.  Great dining experience. Love all the food there. I go weekly.

I love the Hirami Skirt Steak, Zucchini, Cheese Corn,
Mushrooms, Spinach, and Garlic Noodles with Chicken and Calamari, and Edamame.

We want BJ's to be a place where the moment you leave is the moment you plan on coming back. We pride ourselves in our craft and attention to detail. Our guests come here for our award-winning handcrafted beer. They come here for the Southern California twist we've put on the Chicago-style deep dish pizza.

Welcome to BJ's, a restaurant with a Brewhouse soul.","Read more I love coming here I do! The food and rinks are always the best even the waiters but I did make a reservation for 7 people and they said they only had a table for 6 or we had to wait 45 mins for a table??? What??? So we squeezed in a booth. Its just upsetting like isnt thats the point of the opentable app?? But other than that we had fun they did take long to bring mix drinks. Read more The food was disappointing. My steak was over done, the mushroom gravy had no mushrooms and was not gravy but more like brown water and the fries were supposed to be seasoned but I guess they forgot , my husbands steak and sides only took up 1/4 of his plate, and my moms food was cold.
The saving grace for the restaurant was our waiter. He was lovely Read more The waiter must‚Äôve forgotten about us. He kept stopping at the table before us. The kids meals were missing the drinks, the special order was missing the pizookie which the menus says would come with one, but it didn‚Äôt. After the initial order We ordered the trio as well as an additional pizookie, and We wanted to order additional food and drinks. When we finally did get to order the additional food and beverage, The beverage never came, and the additional food also never came. So we ended up canceling the additional food. I guess for him to compensate he said he applied a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù we didn‚Äôt see that, and he gave us coupons that had expired June 2024. Our bill was $5 short of $200 and we really expected better service. We tipped the waiter as well because we weren‚Äôt gonna be rude but really wish for my sons bday would have received better service. Read more Great server, great food and accommodated our toddler with a high chair and coloring supplies. Thank you!  Both food and service were amazing. We were a group of nine celebrating a birthday. We did not have to wait long for our food or drinks. My hats off to your front end staff along with everyone in working behind the scenes in the kitchen. Read more Ordered the Deep Dish Pizza‚Ä¶ hardly any cheese on the pizza, really disappointing. üëé  The positives were that the drinks were good specifically the Pink Cadillac Martini. It was well-balanced and refreshing. Our server was very friendly. The negative is that the food was below average. My battered fish was nearly burned from the outside. Also for fish and chips at $22 that was on the higher end. Had to make it to a movie so no time to send it back. All others entr√©es were just OK. I think the Ontario CA location is better overall. Ôøº Read more I had signed up for the Pazuki monthly program. We hot the chocolate chip one and it was so over cooked we couldn‚Äôt get our spoons into the cookie  The food and service were good.

Waiter took awhile to serve drinks. Food was amazing  Great restaurant for a party! Just celebrated my kid's birthday and the service was great. Food is always delicious. It gets loud here tho.  I swear every time I go to this restaurant I get upset. We had reservation for 9 at 9:30 I understand that it was graduation but the front desk ladies was rude. They told me it was going to be another 45 minutes wait. I told them we had reservation for 9 and the lady argued with us that it was for only 7 people and now we have to wait an hour and a half now. We asked for the manager and when we were talking to her the 1st lady rolled her eyes at us. My wife pointed it out to the manager and she could care less. I showed her my confirmation and she said oh okay let me see what I can do. We finally got seated 30 minutes later. The only bright spot was our server Judd. He was amazing and funny that he changed the mood we were in. Always an upsetting journey here at BJ'S. I really don't know why we keep going there.

Note $8 cash Valet Only parking (at least late afternoon and evening) but if you come early like lunch time... at least we haven't seen a Valet. They do have a Beer of the Month Club which has some extra perks if you wish. Be sure to download the App for that and ordering ahead and making seating reservations. Also to be able to pay your check from the app. No waiting for the buys wait staff. Read more Read more Server Kaylie was great! Manager was great! Tried to help us find cash for valet. Will be back.  Great experience fast service and no complaints. They sat us down and we had a great time  We arrived late and they still honored our reservation, world class service if you ask me! Thank you again!  Very good bar food and good service.  I would definitely go back.  Did not receive glass set with 100$ gift card, soup and prime rib was tepid.  Decent food.  Lot's of options on menu.  Restaurant is always very crowded and noisy.  Waiting area was packed, with nowhere to sit.  Also, had a reservation through Open Table, but still had an over 15 minute wait.  That's the second time that has happened.  I realize it was a busy Saturday night, but a reservation is a reservation. Read more Our server, Bryce, was attentive, kind, and professional.  Food was very good.  It was an enjoyable experience.  Love that specific restaurant in Burbank! Service is good, and the place is really cozy.  Terrible service and awful tasteless drinks and food.  Way, way overpriced.

Almost 40 minutes passed until the hostess approached us to asked if we‚Äôve been attended. ‚ÄúI said no, for nothing ‚Äú she took our order and came back with just one of our coffees and still took another 10 minutes to get my fianc√©s coffe. From there it had already been almost an hour when we finally got our food.
Once we got our food our server finally came to see us and ask how was our food. Food was really good so no complaints there. We were running out of time so I had to go ask the hostess for a desert menu, a box to go,  place an order for dessert and ask for the check all at once cause I didn‚Äôt want to be run out of time. Once we were served our dessert we had no space on our table cause no plates were taken away. I don‚Äôt know about other people but I think that going to a place like DIOSA is to also fulfill an aesthetic side of a good picture and that was not possible with so many plates on our table. I‚Äôm leaving some pictures as a reference of our timeline there. Also the place was almost empty only a big party, two guys before us and a couple that came about 30 min after us.

Every visit is a culinary delight, with food that is consistently flavorful and authentically Italian. Highly recommend!  Excellent food - and customer service was top notch! I will definitely be back!  It‚Äôs a solid 4.5 star experience. Everything we ordered was tasty, well executed, and decently portioned‚Äîi.e., each entree is large enough to fill an average person‚Äôs appetite, without requiring additional sides. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 pastas, the branzino, plus a side of veggies, and it was more than enough food. My partner, the self professed pizza connoisseur, was unimpressed by their margherita pinsa; nevertheless, it was enjoyable to me, with a good balance of ingredients, flavor, and crispness (in its crust). Inside, when half full of guests, the place was quite boisterous. We opted to sit outside, as the weather was nice and much quieter.

Food was terrible, very bland.  
Over cooked squid in squid ink pasta. NOT SEASONSED, just boiled and thrown on top.
Ham toasty was literally just ham and cheese with truffle oil, panini pressed. Nothing special.  
Potato omelet was terrible, again nothing special, no technique, very basic. 
Peach and tomato salad was cut up peaches, watermelon, and tomatos with some basil leaves thrown in and drizzled in basil oil. Very basic. I want to spend money on food that I can't make, not food that I can make!
The list goes on with the food but it's all very much the same thing. Bland, basic, could have made better at home. 

Service was fine.

The 1-year anniversary Chef's Menu was spectacular--delicious, very filling and a great representation of Galician cuisine!  Food was ok.  They were out of some items, one of the items was undercooked.   Nothing truly stood out but nothing was terrible either.  Xuntos is excellent, truly authentic Galcian food, with finesse, originality, and a very fine human touch.  The food is simply delicious and you can't get much of it in the US.  I would say this is the most authentic Spanish restaurant in LA, and surely the only real Galician one.  The service is great, the people are warm, the wines are unique and very, very good.

I have NEVER been to a restaurant where the WHOLE staff stopped past the table to make sure we loved everything, and our server, Nim, was OUTSTANDING. Even the chef came out to explain one of the dishes we had questions about. The food!!! The included seafood tower and the unlimited drinks (there were six alcoholic drinks to choose from) were worth the price alone. But the crispy chicken and waffles were the best I ever had!! The cherry on top was the 360-degree view of Beverly Hills and the live music. Read more I met legendary director Walter Hill for breakfast this past Saturday at your establishment. I decided to forego the $65 for valet parking and grabbed metered parking at Strbx off Wilshire. Walking to the Hilton is not easy. The Merv Griffin way street entrance is closed, so you have to take the long way and actually dodge inbound traffic into the main entrance, which is a long haul from Santa Monica Blvd. Was confused by 40+ valet drivers lined up on Santa Monica Blvd. Literally walked .4 miles from the street to the lobby entrance. Lobby was decent, but the chairs are remarkably uncomfortable. And the elevators up to Circa 55 are confusing. The side with Circa 55/private suites/etc wasn't responding. The restaurant itself is nice enough. Spectacular views. But breakfast was VERY underwhelming. Walter had to ask about his coffee a couple times. I asked for sausage, got bacon instead. We lost our waiter halfway through. And when the check came, I was SHOCKED how expensive coffee, tea, an omelette and eggs over easy was. Walter picked up the check and had a $50 ready for valet. I hope he had more cash. Will check out the Maybourne, the Peninsula, Margot, Mama Shelter for my next script meeting. Can't recommend. Read more Great experience. The kabob platter and Beverly salad were fabulous and our service by Ulyses was exceptional. Fantastic view and pleasant evening.  I ate at this restaurant on Sunday, which was the date before this reservation. On Sunday I wrote a raving review. Everything was perfect. On Monday I ordered the exact same food the exact same way. The state was overcooked and the asparagus was old. No one ever came to checkon my dinner or to pour my wine or my water. It was a night and day from the night before. Very disappointed. Read more My server‚Ä¶.Min was so attentive! Food was over the top  A 10!  And on our wedding PLEASE LET THE STAFF KNOW IT QAS AMAZING  I recently dined at Circa55 at The Beverly Hilton and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We opted for the newly launched set menu, which was absolutely fantastic‚Äîa true hidden gem which wasn‚Äôt publicised at check-in or around the property. The food was beautifully prepared and packed with flavour, far surpassing our expectations.

While the restaurant's decor doesn‚Äôt quite match what you‚Äôd expect from such a prestigious property, the quality of service and the dishes more than compensated for it. The team responsible for service delivery was exceptional‚Äîattentive, friendly, and highly professional. They truly went above and beyond, though it‚Äôs a shame the team‚Äôs efforts are let down by top brass by the lack of investment in the restaurant‚Äôs interior, which is lacking, even by British Hilton standards.

Adding to the ambiance, there was a live singer whose soothing tones perfectly complemented the evening. The view was also a highlight, though somewhat marred by the enormous Waldorf Astoria building plonked next door, which feels rather like an arrogant neighbour unnecessarily overshadowing a true Beverly Hills icon.

That said, Circa55 offers a delightful dining experience, and I highly recommend it for anyone seeking fantastic food, excellent service, and a touch of live music in a classic location. Read more The ambiance was nice, the food and amount that you get was really good. The only reason i deducted points on service is because the servers could have been a little more attentive. We had to ask for refills more than a couple of times (for water, coffee, free flowing cocktails). Servers would disappear leaving us to wonder what happened to them. And the restaurant was nearly empty. Overall we had a good time and would go again. Read more Not good. It was a full hour and 15 minutes before we got our starters. There were a total of like 10 patrons so it didn‚Äôt make sense. Despite veranda looking cute it was very hot and they didn‚Äôt do anything to try to create breeze (open all windows, fans?). They also played zero music outside which was strange. Food was only okay and presentation not good. Overall a bad experience- we expected way more from a 2-hour bottomless brunch at the Beverly Hilton sadly. Will not go back. Read more Average food at high prices. Service was okay. Friendly.  Read more Wonderful brunch spot.   The view is great, staff are top notch and value incredible.   The bunch included bottomless mimosas/Bloody Mary‚Äôs, pastry tower for the table, seafood tower for the table and a great selection of entrees.

My husband and friend had to go to bar and tell the bartender how to make their drinks,  Asked for my filet mignon to be medium and it was well done.

Staff seemed clueless the entire time. Had to wait for our entrees for more than 45 minutes! Every request  took more than 30 minutes to be attended to.

DO NOT COME HERE!!! Read more Saturday is my daughter's graduation ceremony. I chose this hotel as a gift for her. My daughter ordered a beef burger, and it tasted very good.

I will definitely come back to stay at this wonderful hotel and dine in Circa55 next time. Read more Incredibly disappointing.

Staff was very accommodating. Overall everyone really enjoyed the evening Read more Read more Food was just ok. Ambience was great. Nice view. Service was just ok  Nice variety of foods, but needs renovating badly!  Very sad to say not good. I had been going to their buffet for many many years and I have in the past gave it 5 stars. This is my first buffet when they moved upstairs. The staff has changed. The hostesses at the front was like a deer caught in a head light they don‚Äôt know what they are doing.
I specifically asked to be seated inside when I made the reservation and mentioned it again when someone called to confirm but they still seated me at the patio. The food stations were placed very far apart. I guess they want us to eat more so they want us to walk more to get our food.
Had to wait a long time to get our check.
Overall very disappointed especially compared to before when they were downstairs. Won‚Äôt be going there again for a long time. Read more i had made reservations for my partners birthday, because we planned on drinking we took an uber. which took quite a while to be able to drop us off bc of all of the hilton construction. We tried to go in but were stopped bc we didn‚Äôt have ‚Äòcredentials‚Äô. apparently they were hosting a conference at the hotel and security would not allow us into the building to go to the restaurant and told us we needed to leave. Why they didn‚Äôt just cancel our reservations or call us ahead of time, idk. incredibly rude and inconsiderate of our time. We had to walk out of the construction mess to even try to get a taxi or rideshare and eventually walked several more blocks til we found another bar where we scrambled to make other plans. Stay far away from this place, at least until the construction is done in july or august. Read more With construction going on for the next few years I would not bother to go there.  Hopefully things are better when construction ends.  You cannot hear each other talk on the deck and inside its cold and the view is all construction. Read more Nothing really that special about it.  Meat was a little tough and you'd expect more for such a premium price.  My reservation was at 3:30. Greeter didn‚Äôt tell me it was still buffet and that we only had 1hr. Server approached my granddaughters (who look like young teens) and told them the cost of the buffet but didn‚Äôt say how much time we had and asked for drink order. She brought 3 waters and when I saw her I asked for an Ice Tea. Had it refilled 1 time. The food selection and taste was not good. For $145 pp I was expecting better. Vegas and Indian Casino Buffets are better than this and cost less with more selections. Server was friendly but didn‚Äôt deserve $87 for gratuity for 3 ppl. I know it‚Äôs partially my fault for not making sure how things were going to be. I was just going to deal with the cost of food but the gratuity! I will not be returning or will I recommend your establishment. Read more Great service great people. Awesome vibe. Beautiful views  Everyone was amazing and food was so good! The whole staff was very accommodating and kind:)  The Beverly Hilton in general is showing its age. And this restaurant is no exception, in a hotel this large to have just one restaurant is really ridiculous. The restaurant has not been touched in decades I would guarantee the carpet oh my God. Nothing in the restaurant made me want to stay there any longer than I had to to eat my food. Horrible use of space. The whole place should be demoed and start over. I was attending a wedding only reason I would stay there. Too many other nicer hotels in the area. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/4/64203968.webp

Excellent service!  Teleferic is a favorite and has never disappointed. Most recently, our crispy paella had octopus, huge shrimp, and the most generous portion of lobster.

We enjoyed empanadas, paella, and the tomahawk ribeye.  Our server, Jonaton was personable. However, after opening the bottle of wine,  we served our own wine, refilled our own waters,  and used our dirty appetizer plates for the entree. The restaurant includes automatic gratuity,  which clearly allows for substandard service without consequences.  As a habitual overtipper, the included gratuity wasn't earned.

Great ambiance,  great food,  but lackluster service. Read more Tapas is the strong point.  Paella also very good.  Quieter on back patio than energetic noise level inside.  Nice and fun market of products from Spain is also part of this place.  This menu is heavy on ham, pork, and shellfish, so diners not into those things have a big less to choose from. Read more Sadly, this restaurant has been declining since its earlier opening days.  Unfortunately, it is still not a good place in LA to have great Spanish food.  Teleferic is bad to mediocre.  The Pan con tomate was saggy, had no condiments, and was sweet.  The Gambas were too soft and had too much oil sauce for three gambas, making them unappealing.  The artichoke was okay, but it would have never been made of canned artichokes in Barcelona.  The Paella Mixta...oh my gosh...the pork tasted dry and overcooked, the octopus was from a can, the rice was just greasy and had no saffron, which made the whole thing completely lack flavor.  The Torrija was good it could do with a better quality ice cream or just without. Read more Best Spanish food in Los Angeles, maybe in the whole state of California!  As usual, the food and drinks were all very good.  We enjoyed 9 different tapas and 3 desserts.  The service started well, but got slow later in the patio where only 3 tables were in use.  I think this might have been the first time we were there on a week day, and perhaps they did not have as much staff as on the weekends. Read more Service was amazing.  Food and drinks were delicious!  Ambiance and decor was great too. Will definitely be coming back here.  Nice place, good menu. My husband is Spanish, he appreciated some Catalan options.  We had a wonderful time! The paella was fantastic and the tapas were super fun!  Last time I came here the paella had a great flavor but this time it‚Äôs not as good. And frankly it was the paella that made us want to come back. But I guess not anymore.

Read more All in was a wonderful experience except for one item...............we waited 70 minutes ffor our 8 pm reservation. Not seated until 9:10 pm. We checked in @ 7:25 pm and were told we'd be seated at 8 pm. After walking around for a while we returned at 7:55 pm. All along the way until being seated we were told we were next. The hostess was as pleasant as can be.

Finally spoke with the manager who stated along with the hostess that the resrevation system was not working that evening. In any event a very good experience other than the looooong wait Read more Restaurant was 45 minutes late to seat us. And server indicated it was normal. Food was great but a sour way to start the experience.  We always have a wonderful time with Erikka. The food was great. The drinks were great. Love it here. Thank you so much.  Not really worth the price for the food. Thought it was going to be more entertainment wasn‚Äôt much of it at all. Thought the service could be much better as well being that it‚Äôs ‚Äúupscale‚Äù.  Service inside the restaurant was great. Lady in the front who made us wait outside, and lied and said the people who went inside in front of us who didn‚Äôt have a reservation (but we did) was the worst! It was our first time there. I only realized she lied when we got sat at the table, and the same people who were supposed to go to another restaurant were at the same restaurant we were at. Very weird but saw the difference between who she sat at the bar and didn‚Äôt. Once inside, the server and the experience definitely helped the night! Everything inside was great. Read more Read more Great place to entertain. Food and service was very good. Great alcohol selection. We were surprised by a magician before the meal.  We got there as the first seating so there wasn‚Äôt much going on yet. But our waitress Gabrielle was right there to get us started. She explain all of the cocktail‚Äôs throughly, and helped us pick the best one. She explained the menu and what items she liked best etc. The pacing was very nice and we also did the wine pairing which was great. Overall we had a great experience and food was good. Some things better than the others, the corn cr√®me br√ªl√©e starter was amazing as well as the dessert.
We will for sure go back and ask for Gabrielle or her twin sister Rachel, they made our experience wonderful. Read more Went for my birthday dinner and had amazing time! They even had a magician!!  I recently had the pleasure of dining at Maison Kasai, a teppanyaki restaurant that left an indelible impression. From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance transported me to a bygone era, reminiscent of a sophisticated speakeasy.

The food surpassed all expectations, with each dish crafted to perfection. The teppanyaki style cooking showcased the culinary mastery of the chefs, resulting in an array of delectable flavors that tantalized the taste buds.

What truly elevated the experience was the impeccable service, notably by Gabrielle, my server. Her attentive care and insightful recommendations added an extra layer of enjoyment to the evening. Gabrielle‚Äôs expertise ensured that every choice I made was nothing short of exceptional.

Without hesitation, I‚Äôd recommend Maison Kasai to anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience. Read more Omg ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä this  was such an amazing dinner with my daughter and sister for my daughter's birthday.   Lucio our cook seasoned everything very well the different steak sauces were amazing we tried them all,  thanks Benihanas for letting him go ‚ù§Ô∏è Erica our waitress was an absolute gem.  She was so friendly kind information answered all our questions and gave really good food and drink options   I honestly can't wait to go back.  The check was a lil on the expensive side, but was very worth it totally;   The steaks were perfect   and delicious.  Thank you so Maison Kasai for making my daughter birthday evening a big hit. Read more We made reservations for 7:45pm and didnt get seated until 9:40pm  It was very much a pleasure to go and have such a unique experience definitely going back  I saw a lot of negative reviews on OpenTable and was hesitant at first, but I realized there‚Äôs some people who don‚Äôt think these experiences are worth it. I would describe the concept at level 8 to be a Disney land cocktail or restaurants bars, and a club.
Let me start off by saying that at first I was not impressed that my reservation was at nine and I didn‚Äôt get seated till 930 . We were waiting for 30 min NO DRINK just waiting in the library section to get seated. They kept saying they were getting the table ready. What made the wait a little less irritating was the girl swinging from the ceiling. Then I got to take a bunch of cute photos in the ‚Äúlibrary ‚Äú waiting area before they pass you through the book case and another bar I forgot it‚Äôs name but it‚Äôs a definitely must check out to.
It‚Äôs about time a modern new classy version of teppanyaki was created . I always go with what the servers recommend and considering it was a Birthday dinner celebration so I wanted to go all out as I could üòÖ
Wish I could describe everything I ordered but take a look at the photos. Read more Upon entrance, looks amazing! Level 8 is literally a maze with excitement at the end of each hall way. Our reservations were for 8:30p seated 9:15p! The waiting area was crowded - they did give us mini cheesecakes then we discovered the bar behind the first wall. Once seated we waited a moment still until drink orders were taken. We waited so long we just grabbed drinks from the bar inside which is convenient but inconvenient. My server was female, she wasn‚Äôt very welcoming at all. Seems like she made our food according to what she liked. I‚Äôve never had sweet fried rice. Pur√©e tofu for the starter needs to stripped from the menu. Portions were uneven when it came to fried rice. My food was ‚Äúplated‚Äù but oh so ugly still. Everything was aesthetically pleasing but they were missing a few touches! Restrooms super clean. Read more It was like a dark and secret dining experience but the food is just okay.  I do agreed with other Yelp reviews about leaving cooked steaks on the rack is bad as our steaks(too thin) were well done when served.  Hopefully chefs can adjust their cooking style so steaks are cook to order. Read more Read more We been here twice and it‚Äôs been so good!  The food, drinks and ambience is amazing.  Our reservation was at 7:45pm and we weren‚Äôt seated until 9:15pm. Our chef did not come to the table until 9:40pm. The food was mediocre. The twin waitresses were amazing and were very accommodating given the circumstances. Ryan the manager was also helpful. However, I recommend Que Barbaro when dining at Level 8. Oh yeah, there was no magician‚Ä¶@ least not while we were there. Read more This place is the worst. Sat us by a cold door. Bill was $1500 for six people. Each had dinner and 2-3 cocktails. Service was terrible and really didn't have the etiquette you'd expect for this level of restaurant. Sorry, I really like level 8 in general but this restaurant was the terrible. Read more What an awesome experience. This is tepanyaki next level. Our waitress Rachel is awesome, she‚Äôs very familiar with the menu and recommended items that‚Äôs preferred by the group. Will definitely come back. Oh it was my first time trying caviar and it was amazing. Highly recommended. Read more What an incredible night! I took my family who were visiting from Boston to Maison Kasai at Level8 and they were blown away! Amazing food prepared by Chef Ryan, outstanding service from Erika, and we were even treated to a mind-blowing magic show! This was the perfect spot for our long overdue family reunion. Thank you Maison Kasai Team and Houston Hospitality! Read more Unfortunately I did not think this place was worth the hefty bill :( service was great but my steak was overly salty. My favorite thing was probably the caviar bump. It was still a good experience with my friends but we weren‚Äôt impressed enough to go back. Read more The ambiance is amazing, especially because they offer the experiences on one level. The restaurant is right through a wall, so it was pretty cool to go through Wanderlust and experience that.

However, the food was just ok. They do have good appetizers ‚Äî one especially with the tapioca balls that you can ONLY GET if you order tepenyaki. They do no allow you to swap protein items from the al a carte menu to the tepanyaki menu (huge bummer) so we had to order one of each.

I chose the steak (similar to filet) my girl had ordered the cod. Nothing fancy about the taste, they do have sauces but that‚Äôs the only kick it gave the meals. Other than a simple seasoning they use across all meats.

I am definitely excited to try the other restaurants to see the taste they bring! Read more The level 8 complex is awesome. Food was good, but not worth the price. Service was fantastic! We had twin female servers and they were GREAT! Once again, food was not worth the price.  Service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all amazing. The truffle risotto was delicious and the bartender made an amazing Old Fashion which paired with it nicely. Highly recommend this place. Read more Service is great!  Drinks are great!  Atmosphere is vibrant, food is very over priced for the quality.  Little to no flavor, fried rice was the best thing.  Fish was bland, steak was bland and poor quality of meat.  Very tendon and veiny.  A bit of a disappointment. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/64359181.webp

Highly recommend Alexander's.  Very nice steakhouse, definitely in the high end. Fried rice is delicious.  Second time dining here & I have no complaints. Everything was amazing!  Our recent visit to Alexander‚Äôs Steakhouse in Pasadena was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment we sat down, we were treated to an exceptional dining experience, beginning with a thoughtful gift from the chef‚Äîa bite of wasabi hummus on a crisp pita cracker‚Äîand a glass of champagne. The attention to detail and presentation was impressive from the outset.

For drinks, I opted for the omakase cocktail experience, where you choose your preferred spirit and a flavor profile (aromatic or citrusy). I selected whiskey with a fresh, citrusy touch, and the bartender crafted a fantastic whiskey passion fruit cocktail that was absolutely divine. My significant other went with a Japanese beer, which was equally enjoyable.

Our appetizers set the tone for the rest of the meal: we ordered the octopus and scallop dishes, both of which were exquisitely prepared and bursting with flavor. For our main course, we each chose steak. I had the 18oz ribeye chop, cooked to a perfect medium, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender. My significant other‚Äôs Kansas City strip was just as impressive‚Äîwell-seasoned, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. We also shared sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli, both delicious, and highly recommend adding the bone marrow and chimichurri‚Äîthey elevated the meal even further.

Dessert was the perfect ending to an already stellar meal. We enjoyed the molten lava cake and pumpkin cheesecake, accompanied by a decaf Americano and vanilla latte. To top it off, the staff surprised us with an additional cheesecake and candle to celebrate our anniversary‚Äîa thoughtful and memorable gesture. Just when we thought it couldn‚Äôt get any better, they brought out a fluffy blue cotton candy, which made our evening even sweeter, especially after a big Dodger win!

The service throughout the evening was impeccable. Every staff member was attentive, friendly, and genuinely engaged in making sure we had an unforgettable experience. Read more The overall experience was good. We had requested to sit in a quieter corner, but instead, we were seated in a table in the middle of the loud room. It was not a dealbreaker, but it was a little disappointing it was the opposite of what we had hoped for this occasion. The team was professional and provided great service. However, it was hard to get their attention and it was also slow, perhaps because it seemed to be a busier than usual night. Overall, we had a good time. Thank you Read more We loved everything at Alexander‚Äôs steakhouse. Food was incredible service, was A+. We truly loved our birthday experience. Ôøº  Great experience, I would definitely come here again. Customer service was amazing.  Always a wonderful experience whenever we go to Alexander‚Äôs. The food, service, and atmosphere are always in point.  Service was excellent. House cabernet by the glass was very good. Food was good but at ""exceptional food"" prices. Impressed that they offered French profiteroles, e.g., but the ice cream was way too hard. Should be softish ice cream in a profiterole. Bottom line: Good food, but not worth $260 for two people, two glasses of cab, plus dessert for one and coffee for one. Westside French cafes do better for $160. Read more Excellent steaks & seafood! Wonderful service!  Great place to celebrate a birthday!  Read more Great food and great experience.  The Kansas Strip was amazing.  Friendly staff, over promised and under delivered. We made reservations at 7:15 and they hadn‚Äôt brought the steak out until after 9 pm. If I wanted to eat late, I wouldn‚Äôt have made the reservations so early. The place was empty so im not sure why it took so long. Only after I complained, did they bring out the steak. The steak was ok, wagyu tartar was very salty. The watermelon salad was the best thing we had. Quite pricey and not worth it in my opinion. Steak 48 in BH is significantly better and has a vibe. I live in the BH area and traveled to Pasadena for a mediocre dining experience. Read more Perfect dinner night. Food was delicious. Service was exceptional. Wish I had room for dessert. Next time!  Great cocktails, excellent service, and exceptional food. So happy to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary at Alexander‚Äôs.  Great Service and Food. So unique meat selection.

Come back again soon.  I‚Äôm a big steakhouse fan. First time here and it‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm trying to understand why most steakhouses serve steak warm. By the time your 1/2 way to your meal it‚Äôs cold. Mastros and Ruth Chris serve them super hot and that‚Äôs a good thing. This place is only missing that.

Beautiful restaurant great lay out. Great service from the bartender and the server. The pulpit de casa was wonderful but the rest of the food was unimpressive. Will be back  Service by Robert is top notch and overall this place is a hidden gem  5 of us dined here last Saturday; food and service were mediocre. They charged us automatic 20% gratuity for the service which I don‚Äôt understand. Not really happy what I paid for  Delicious food. Great atmosphere. You really feel that you are in a different country.
I absolutely recommend this place  Read more Great food and ambiance.  Service was rushed, but not intrusive.  The live music was a great addition to our experience.

You hear the music from everywhere  Amazing service and food. Music was great and ambience was wonderful. Thank You!  We were inside because we weren't dressed for a cool evening but the patio is definitely where to be. Inside dining is very basic. Food is good but we only had charcuterie which was lovely but not really the chef's chance to show off. The sangr√≠as, both white and red were excellent. We did have croquettes which were very good. Read more Great food, great service, best sangria, lovely patio dining with live music.  I asked a girl out and she said yes.  The food here is always excellent. The beet salad and sangria are over-the-top delicious. But whatever you do, DO NOT go into the back room. The noise was horrid and it wasn't even full. Wait and dine on the patio or on the front porch, or even in the room with the bar. If they try to seat you in the windowless back room with bulls on the wall, RUN. Otherwise, the food was fantastic. Read more Read more This is my second review. We had a perfect birthday gathering. The short ribs with lentils and garlic shrimp are superb. The pitcher of sangria was large enough to cover our party. We have been to Spain many times, and the patio environment captures the feeling. The only issue I have is that the paella did not have socarrat, but was tasty nonetheless. Read more Great food, service, and a lovely patio with a fountain.  Delicious food and fun atmosphere.  It‚Äôs has low ceilings so it‚Äôs loud when you are seated indoors.
Didn‚Äôt take away from the delicious dinner.  We love the waiters   Richard is the best  always goes out of he way to make us happy.. we always vibe back counting on him being there on the weekends .  Paella seafood is delicious too  Even though it was sweltering outside, we had a lovely dinner on the patio last night at Casa Cordova. Our server Robert was very efficient but not obtrusive.

We shared the shrimp and mushroom appetizer, which is so delicious.  I had the salmon and my husband had the chicken pasta. The only negative thing I could say is that the food a little on the heavy side during the summertime.Ôøº

But the setting is lovely, food delicious.  I would highly recommend it. Read more Wonderful food  My husband and I went there with friends during the Friday night event with kive music at the patio. It was a good experience for our friends who have never been there before. I enjoyed the Soanish guitar playing although I wish that the tunes played were all Spanish songs.

The food was good overall,  but I found the shrimp of my mushroom and shrimp on a skewer atop a slice of baguette over cooked last night, and so the shrimp was.tough. The olives are always fantastic, but we bow have  to pay for it whilst it used to be free. The sangria was deliciously strong! üòã The crema Catalana was in the soupy side tonight foe some reason. Read more Roberto was an amazing server. We had a larger party and everyone was well taken care of. The food was all great and the general atmosphere was very pleasing. I do wish the entertainment was either up in the balcony or the volume was lower. For those sitting closer to the guitar player, it made it too loud to communicate. But everything else was a 5 out of 5! Read more A bit overpriced and the  marinera paella was not worth it. Rice was over cooked and way too salty.

Chef Nao Sugiama, Thank you for the wonderful experience.  We had four people in our party.  Three fixed price menu, one premium sushi, and 4 ala carte items.   Food was okay at best...Nothing unique.  Our server was attentive, but there are lots of restaurants that are much better in this price range.  Unfortunately, we don't think we will go back again. Read more We indulged in a variety of appetizers and happy hour specials, along with selection of sushi rolls, all of which were delightfully delicious. The service was exceptional, further enhancing our dining experience. This place is our go-to spot for sushi. Read more Excellent sushi. High-grade. I was there very early before a show so unsure what the noise level or atmosphere is during a normal dinner hour.  Service was excellent. But, we were expecting more variety based on menus posted. Menu is limited now so we had to order a pre-fixe. Prices high, but good quality.  I came to Umaya specifically to dine at the counter and chat with Chef Nao Sugiyama, who had his eponymous restaurant in midtown Manhattan for over 20 years. His Kaiseki menu at Umaya includes some of my favorite dishes at his NY restaurant and new offerings as well.  Chef Sugiyama created some special dishes for my dining experience as it‚Äôs been nine years since we last saw one another.

The sashimi course was as beautiful and fresh tasting as I remembered.  My all-time favorite continues to be the grilled lobster with uni.  A surprise  course was the hairy crab done three ways - divine!   And the waygu beef on hot stone with mushrooms and scallion was melt in your mouth.   I also had a clam and tofu skin soup that was clear, comforting and full of delicious flavor.  As before, his grapefruit dessert is so light and refreshing.
Ask the staff the best sake and red wine to compliment the Kaiseki meal.   They are so knowledgeable.
Now that I have found Chef Sugiyama again, I will be back for more memorable culinary experiences. Read more It was great service and food. Recommend the Omakase.  Great staff, great food, great ambience! Their prix fixe dining options were balanced and rich with flavor, but well priced. Would highly recommend the octopus as well.  Read more What can i say the price is GOOD AND THE FOOD IS PHENOMENAL  Made a reservation and we seated as soon as we got there. We did the dinner and we didn‚Äôt do a fixed menu. We just ordered all the cart. Tried the octopus vinaigrette, four cocktails and one of their sushi boards where they bring you 12 different types of fish about two pieces each of each type of fish, and then seaweed and rice to make your own hand rolls. They bring a little plate with six different types of salt and other tiny fixings. a salad and we had miso soup. All the food was perfect. The food is delicious. The fish was so tasty,.

The service was fantastic. There was no issue at all with the service. Everyone is very kind there and they help each other out so there are no blind Spots in the way they manage their restaurant.

It‚Äôs very quiet and peaceful. There is some music but the music is very low melodic practically elevator music, but better sounding. This is not the right place for a date if you don‚Äôt know that person very well. They have valet.

The cocktails were delicious. We try to cucumber drink, a lychee drink, a mescal drink that I don‚Äôt recall the name of, and another drink that I don‚Äôt remember. The point is, for me to have tried four of the eight cocktails and they were all delicious, means something to me because I love cocktails and I care a lot about a place that is presenting with cocktails. So this is definitely a place where you don‚Äôt have to just stick the beer. Usually when I go to sushi I only stick to beer. But this place has a great cocktail menu.
Ôøº
We also got an opportunity to try dessert which is really good too.

I will mention that this restaurant is a tiny bit pricey when it comes to the sushi, however, the quality is very good for what you are getting. If you want good sushi and you‚Äôre willing to pay about 20 to 25% more for everything, this is your place.  The cocktails are fairly priced. In fact they could be priced higher for how good they are. But the sushi is pricey.Ôøº

We will definitely be coming back here. Read more My party of 4 had a blast at Umaya LA! We came on a late Saturday evening and had a reservation on Open Table (they require a $15 per person deposit when reserving; this deposit goes toward your final bill). We attempted to call the restaurant but was unable to get a representative on the phone, but understandably they are probably very busy! We drove to the restaurant anyway and KTown always has difficult parking, but luckily Umaya has a valet service (we were very happy with this especially with the rain)! The valet were respectful and courteous and handled the car well. Right as we were parking, we actually got a call from the manager of Umaya and he was very very kind to still accommodate our reservation despite being very late. We were seated promptly and the server was very kind, patient, and attentive.

We loved the ambiance of the place. The music was great, the decor was beautiful and really set a dim, chill atmosphere. Most of us ordered from the omakase menu (Tsuki to be exact), and we all really enjoyed not only the service of the omakase, but the taste of each dish was incredible with high quality, fresh fish and the presentation was beautiful! There were 3-4 sushi chefs working so the service was quick! We were always eating which was appreciated as it was a late dinner. I will definitely come back to try another omakase menu item or even their lunch omakase, which looks fun! Read more Best experience in a long time. Chef Nao served us a six course meal that did not disappoint. Terrific value for the amount of food. Excellent service!  Chef Nao‚Äôs Omakase was amazing not only because of the food but because of Chef Naos personal touch. He deeply cares about his guests and makes them feel extremely welcome. Highly recommend! Read more Every time I go to Umaya LA, it is an extraordinary experience! The Kaiseki and Omakase surpassed all my expectations, consistently delivering excellence.  My guests are always impressed, and even neighboring tables couldn't stop raving about the superb sushi and delightful desserts. Umaya LA takes my palate on an amazing journey every visit. Can't wait to go back for more! Read more Had the five course meal, and it was wonderful. The saizuke course of seasonal appetizers was a fun New Year‚Äôs assortment and went very well with a recommended sake. The hot stone course was excellent; not only the beef but also the mushrooms and onions were very flavorful. Rice with dried shiso seasoning, soup and pickles were a great way to finish off the meal. Read more Excellent food but the restaurant was almost empty.  Fantastic food & service.  Really great sushi spot!  I booked this restaurant last minute for a birthday party. I was very fortunate that they accommodated for 15 people. They were extremely organized and provided amazing service. Everyone in our group was amazed by the food, ambiance and quality.

The food is always delicious, portion sizes are a bit small for the price but still delicious, nonetheless. The waitress, although swamped, was very attentive and got everything right.

Read more The servers need to be more attentive and it feels so compact in there.

The food was amazing as well as the drinks ! Read more Great experience and food was amazing will be back  This may be the worst experience I have had at a restaurant that accepts reservations. Perhaps just for that day, but the service was absolutely dreadful. It was clear that they were short staffed- for about the first 1.5 hrs there were two people bussing tables, taking orders, closing out, cleaning and resetting tables, running food, and making drinks. The guy serving us worked really hard to juggle everything and he can‚Äôt be blamed. The restaurant should have done a better job getting coverage or communicating their tough situation to customers.

The food should NOT be labeled as Jamaican. I am from the Caribbean, have eaten lots of Jamaican food. I was there with my girlfriend and her sister, both Jamaican. The rice and peas was dry, the brown stew chicken tasted like a sweet stew chicken, the jerk chicken was not jerked but had something closer to a miso glaze over chicken, same for the jerk salmon. The curry chicken had something that‚Äôs not supposed to be in curry chicken but I can‚Äôt quite put my tastebuds on it. The only thing I can say is that the fried plantains were enjoyable and the Mac n cheese oxtail starter was also pretty decent. For the prices on the menu, nothing was worth it.
I‚Äôd be reluctant to try the menu again or return to the restaurant Read more Rice was a bit dry. Drinks were too sweet had the passion fruit mule it had too much syrup or whatever flavoring they used  Me and my wife had the valentine special that was $225 didn‚Äôt know until once food was delivered it was one plate to share through out the whole  5 course meal, food was great but was very over priced for the amount gave gratuity was a forced $50 which I would of tipped generously regardless but to be forced to tip $50 after being over charged for food and having to ask multiple times for things I feel this place is very over hyped we walked away spending $371 not close to full I have spent half the price at Ruth Chris and got 3 times the amount of food we was served ‚Ä¶also bought a mango passion and there was NOOO liquor present what so ever ‚Ä¶the service was not the problem it was the over pricing and little servings of everything Read more Unfortunately, this place did not update the address nor phone number via google search.

Service was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant. Read more This is a great Jamaican restaurant in Los Angeles.  The only problem is the location.  It it located in Little Tokyo, which is not a popular neighborhood.  When we went on a Saturday night at 7pm, it was empty.  There were 2 other tables by the time we we left, but lots of empty tables and the bar was empty.  They were playing 90s and 00 reggae, which was an AMAZING vibe.  The food was decent.  As a Caribbean family, it was not the best, but still was good.  I really liked my curry chicken, but I felt the jerk chicken was too sticky instead of like a rub.  My kids got the jerk chicken and waffles and they really liked the waffles and the chicken.  My wife didn't love the oxtails, but she also had just come from Jamaica the previous week and really had authentic oxtails recently.  Overall, enjoyed the restaurant.

Now it has become a massive disappointment.  Our waiter Moises was awesome!  The food was great!  The tables of other parties was extremely close and was constantly bumped by patrons and servers walking pass our table during dining. Our party had to push the table away from wall space just to avoid the discomfort of being constantly bumped. Read more We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, even though we were there at the time of of our reservation.  Our waitress was very attentive, polite, honest and answered all our questions. Two plates fed 4 of us, with enough to take home.  This would be our 2 nd time going to this location with a large party. We enjoy the family  style dining. The cheesy garlic bread is good and the chicken parm is a must. The white Sangria is one of my favorites. Read more Service was great and fast, food was good but very pricey, expected more flavor but i still enjoyed it  This ia not our first rodeo here at Buca. I love this place. I decided to order a different salad. I ordered the garden salad. The taste was not tasty. The dressing tastes like water rather than oil and vinegar dressing. We also tried a different pizza. Sausage and mushroom was tasty but the salad was so sad. I won‚Äôt order the salad again. Read more Hosted could‚Äôve at least smiled once. She looked like she didn‚Äôt want to be there which kinda ruined my mood for a while.  Delicious food right before a movie. Great dining experience.

First time at this establishment didn‚Äôt know they had a 2nd floor! It was a bit difficult with 2 elderly people. . NOT GOOD Read more For it being a very quiet lunch hour, service was horrible  They took 20 minutes to sit us eventought they had plenty of tables. The server seemed to have a cold but was still working. Good was ok but not great. The restaurant is overwhelming with lots of decorations and my kid was asking about the naked paintings and enema references on the walls. Not a good place to go in my opinion Read more Alberto was our waiter. Super courteous, knowledgeable on menu items, very attentive.
Thank you for making Joseph bday a great one.  Not a bad option for Citywalk - particularly if you have a group since they have family style portions/pricing.  Service was very nice when we went.  Always a go-to when we visit Universal Studios. Order the Apple Gorgonzola Salad and Spicy Aribata Pizza.  Surprisingly good and efficient paced food and excellent service by our waiter Don. We are local and will return.  Took my wife, Daughter and grandsons for my celebrate my wife‚Äôs Birthday. Our server Lucia was awesome, took care of our needs perfectly. I accidentally booked for 2 instead of 5 and the front desk staff took care of us no problem.
Way to go Buca di Beppo Read more Excellent Service with great dining deals. Love the Spicy Arrabiata Pizza.

I reserved in advance to be accommodated for my car seat/ stroller. I was given a table upstairs with to booth to accommodate baby.  Excellent food. Prices are reasonable compared with the portions  Never have an issue with anything here ,, even tho it‚Äôs in the middle of tourist universal city they still deliver good food and service !  Waiter was awesome. The fettuccini was kind of bland. We prefer the lasagna or spaghetti and meatballs, but we had a coupon and wanted to try something else. Will stick with lasagna as it‚Äôs our daughter‚Äôs favorite. Read more The food and their service was just outstanding. Gonna make sure to go there once again  Great service and good food.

We had a great time and the food was wonderful!  Excellent service and amazing food as usual. Great for couples or families.  Great service!  We came in about 30 minutes before close so the salad bar wasn‚Äôt super fresh but the soups and sides were still warm and the fruit and salads were still cold. Staff were very attentive and were able to fulfill all our requests. Read more The meat selections were good and cooked well, but unfortunately, the cold selections bar was very lacking. Ôøº  Servers were very attentive, food was cooked to perfection, drinks are worth the price  Always an excellent experience.  Good food.  Delighted to introduce new people to this place.  Service was slow no communication between kitchen and servers. Meat speed was slow had to ask multiple times for meat service  I ordered the beef ribs, mac and cheese, Parmesan fries, and a pi√±a colada. We arrived at 4:40 pm but were told they weren‚Äôt ready for service yet, so we waited at the bar until 5 pm. Once seated, we had to choose between the truffle filet mignon and the beef ribs, and we opted for the beef ribs. A few minutes later, the server informed us that the ribs would take 45 minutes to prepare.

By the time the server returned, it would have taken 30 minutes to get the ribs. We waited for an extended period while other tables around us received complimentary cheese bread. I had to request water and bread, which arrived 30 minutes after we were seated.

I initially asked a server if we could access the salad bar while we waited. He first said yes but then changed his mind, stating it wasn‚Äôt included. When a different server arrived, she stared at me for five minutes before informing me that the salad bar wasn‚Äôt included unless we paid an additional $35.

It wasn‚Äôt until the third server that we received the complimentary bread. When the food finally arrived, it tasted great, but we noticed that the ribs only had two bones instead of the three described on the menu. We were told this was how the supplier provides them, which didn‚Äôt clarify whether we received the 100 oz we paid $145 for. The ribs also had a lot of fat and it was annoying having to remove every single piece.

We paid and left, disappointed. The only reason we came was because we were told everything was halal. Although the menu does list pork, I was assured over the phone that everything was halal. They should clearly communicate this rather than just stating that everything is halal.

Overall, I don‚Äôt think I would come again to this location. I‚Äôm paying for high quality food and good service. I felt disregarded and belittled by servers.

Not too busy for a Sunday night.  Celebrating our son 22nd Birthday.  The service was slow very slow.  When we said something our waited stated that it was busy.  Very few people in the restaurant.  Bread didn't come until after the appetizers.  Waiter didn't know that we didn't get our appetizers and asked how we liked them.  My wife when asked how things are going she said not good.  My wife will let things roll off and not say anything.  For her to say not good meant something.  They did do a nice job with the birthday butter cake.  We will not be coming back.

Read more Restaurant was nice, service was amazing, food was great and was a very calm atmosphere for Friday night.  Love the food and the ambiance.  They were short staffed at that time, so the server had to run up and down the stairs, which caused a delay in service, but it good!  Steaks was dry . Waiter forgot to bring or drink and bread . We had to remind him .  Delicious food and drinks, amazing service! Bread that is brought to table is served warm is very good.  The food was delicious. I enjoyed a medium filet mignon.  For some reason there were fruit flies flying around and landing on my food as I was trying to eat. I could not enjoy my meal. I was very disappointed.  The service was terrible. Their timing with everything was off. There was water and a glass that was from someone else at our table when we arrived. All the appetizers came out with no share plates, even though we asked for them multiple times. Ôøº Read more We had a lunch there.  The place is so beautiful and the lunch menu was great.  We all enjoyed our lunch together.  The service was the top notch! We will try their dinner next time.  Read more The waiter rarely came to check on us.  The steaks were undercooked and we couldn't find anyone to tell them.  I finally found the manager who took the steaks back to the kitchen, but he never returned to check on us.   I cannot believe that no one ever came out to see if the steaks were properly cooked when brought back.   And no one came to apologize for the inconvenience of half of us eating while the other half was waiting for our steaks to be re-cooked.  I go to a lot of steakhouses, and this experience was one of the worse I have had.  They used to be a lot better. Read more Second time here and it was as delicious as the first time.  The steaks melts in your mouth like butter.  Perfectly cooked. Yum yum. We will definitely be back.  The wait staff was attentive, but not intrusive. The shrimp cocktail was delicious: plump, sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp and a very interesting sauce, which was miso and mustard in addition to a semi spicy cocktail sauce. Our table had shared sides of creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes, both of which were outstanding. Steaks were perfectly cooked, and the crabcakes were delicious, almost 100% crab meat. The Malbec and Duckhorn Cab were perfect complements to dinner. Read more Thankyou, my fiance enjoyed his bday dinner with our family. We really appreciate your patience with our large party.

Excellent food and service - friendly & efficient. Perfect combo!  The lobster bisque and shrimp appetizer were both delicious. The crabcakes were excellent as was the steak. Finally, the desserts were really good.  The sides and appetizers were so convoluted and complex that the any essence of the original food was lost. Maybe pandering to the American tendency to make something more complicated and overly flavored, but this has been a failure at even that. Read more Exceptional restaurant in every way.

We had a business lunch. Everything was great.  We had a very enjoyable experience. Our party of 5 enjoyed  the initial cocktails and an excellent Dine L.A. menu, with enhancements. We arrived early as this restaurant is in the Century City mall and we did not know location. Once we located it, we were able to be seated early, and began our evening. The service was good, attentive, with ample portions and sharable sides (enhancements). We were all pleased with selections. Two items of note: the downstairs dining room is not open; therefore dining is only upstairs, but there is an elevator.  Also the closest valet parking closes early, and in order not to search for your car, select another valet or garage parking.

Thank you for making my children feel special and especially my son on his birthday. The food was delicious! Ôøº Read more We had a great birthday celebration. The service by Sean was exceptional. The food delicious. The rolls and the crab fried rice are standouts. I do find them a bit inconsistent: we were there a month prior and got a butter cake for the birthday girl, this time we got a tiny cheesecake. Last time, we were told that the crab fried rice could be ordered as a side (it‚Äôs not on the menu), this time it was ordered as a side, but it was as if we were being done this ‚Äúspecial, out of the lines‚Äù favor. The pork chop was uneven. I ordered medium and it was a mix of medium-rare to well; dry in places. I would probably brine the pork, and add some au jus with a smidgen of sweetness in the au jus. They make an excellent Shirley Temple for the non drinkers.

The ambience is very nice; not too noisy. But, I do think gentlemen should have to remove their hats. Read more Del Frisco's is exactly what you expect.  Good steak and seafood and the usual sides.  Not Fu Fu...........just very good steakhouse food.  Amazing service and perfect food. The steaks are amazing  As bad as it could be. Food, service, all bad. Apps and service were so bad we tried to leave them, but the manager convinced us to stay for the steaks we had ordered, offering to comp them. The steaks, ordered medium rare, were bloody, and that‚Äôs coming from someone who loves rare meat. We still ended up paying $200 without the steaks. Horrible. We canceled our membership as well.
