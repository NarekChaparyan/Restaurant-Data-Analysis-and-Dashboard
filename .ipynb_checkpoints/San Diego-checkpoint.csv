Wonderful experience at STK. Our server Omar was attentive and professional. It was nice to see the managers visiting tables and ensuring guest satisfaction. Food was yummy! Can’t wait to come back again. Read more STK was recommended by my AMEX card.  What a great place!!  Excellent food and service.   This was a treat.   A little expensive, but worth it!  Overall the restaurant was OK, servers polite and friendly (just could have benefited from being told about the portion sizes).  Food was very good.  We were seated in a back area with only one other table taken, so can’t comment really on the ambiance…looked lively in the main area. Read more Most of the staff was amazing, super friendly, and helpful. Out waiter however, tried to cut off happy hour or twenty minutes early. He only let us place one order and warned us that it would be the last call for happy hour. It wasn’t until we asked another staff if it was over that we were able to order one more drink Read more Raphael made the night!!! Just an absolutely fantastic server and person!  Service & food was amazing! No better happy hour deal than at STK!  Amazing experience as always. Yaya the manager was amazing and hilarious!  I was really excited to experience brunch here but was unfortunately very disappointed.
Place was completely empty at noon for Sunday brunch. Everything was grossly overpriced. I’m happy to pay $22 for an espresso martini, but not when it’s in a smaller than normal martini glass , and made with Tito’s. Fries were great. Lobster Benedict was decent, but no where near worth $50. Not much lobster at all, and no potatoes or side.  I will not go back nor recommend it to friends. Read more We went for my bday celebration and from the moment we arrived, the customer service was superb! The food was delicious our waitress was the best! And my girlfriend forget her phone at the restaurant, I called and spoke to Scott he was a manager and confirmed that they had her phone and offered to walk it across the street to our hotel, we were staying at the Pali Hotel, like W H A T!? I’m so thankful for him! Best Birthday Dinner ever!!! Read more Read more Our service was impeccable. Josh not only was knowledgeable but was sincere and kind. I don’t live in the area but if I can get great service like that all day everyday I’d move. The food and dessert was amazing. All in all STK in San Diego is that spot to go to for great food, great service and great ambience Read more Went for Restaurant week- starter, entree and dessert. Lil BRGs the bomb-super juicy sliders, ahi tacos delish, skirt steak cooked to perfection, apple pie hits the spot, Parmesan truffle fries- fried to perfection and portion size was huge.

The staff are superb! Host greeted me with a smile (did not get his name) and he made us feel extremely welcome (probably best host ever!!) and our server was AJ-spectacular job! Was professional, friendly, informative and answered our questions and made sure we were taken care of.  We'll be back for sure! Kudos to the managers at STK! Well done! Read more Disappointed in our experience at STK on a Friday night. Had a reservation, still had to wait to be seated. Seemed like the hosts were scrambling and overwhelmed. We got seated in a back room which felt like a forgotten space. We sat amongst large parties 8 and 10 tops which felt isolating as a party of 2. We were constantly being bumped into by wait staff and guests. Politely asked to be moved to a quieter booth and were accommodated. Food was decent but not for the value. My filet was overcooked. My husbands rib eye was great. Sides and dessert were tasty. Our waiter was lovely and doing the best he could on a hectic night. Overall not impressed especially for the price/value. Expected more attention to detail and wow factor from food. Overwhelmed by the chaos, underwhelmed by food. Read more Hands down the worst dining experience ever. The steak was outrageously overpriced for something that tasted like cardboard. The ambiance? A nightmare—horrible lighting that made the place feel like a dungeon, paired with obnoxious, blaring music that killed any hope of conversation. Service? Nonexistent. We waited forever, and when the food finally arrived, it was gross and cold. Had to send the steak back twice because the first time it was overcooked, the second time it was under cooked. The staff couldn't care less. This place is a complete joke—don’t waste your time or money. I'd rather eat a microwave dinner in the dark than ever step foot here again. The server was nice but we didnt catch his name. Read more I recently dined at STK for a special occasion—my anniversary—and it truly exceeded my expectations. First off, the food was amazing. Every dish was bursting with flavor, perfectly prepared, and well presented. I had initially thought the place might be overrated, but it absolutely isn’t.
What made the night even more special was the exceptional service we received from the The Manager. Not only was he incredibly professional, but he also brought some great vibes to the evening. His friendly and genuine demeanor added a unique touch to the experience, making us feel welcome and appreciated.
All in all, it was an unforgettable evening for me and my wife, and we’ll definitely be back! Highly recommended. Read more Had an excellent dinner and our waiter Dan P. (Frenchie) was fabulous.  All of the staff were great and the food was over the top delicious.  We will return.  We wanted to try this restaurant during restaurant week and it did not disappoint. The food and service were great and we will come back again.  Raphael, our waiter, did an excellent job. Food was excellent, as well. Wine list is definitely overpriced at all price points. $20 retail bottles priced at over $100 dollars. $60 retail bottles priced in excess of $200.  Great vibe and energetic atmosphere. Read more We were seated 90 minutes after our booked reservation. I understand there are delays but that was ridiculous for a reservation booked four months in advance, not a new restaurant, and big work dinner place. Read more Always excellent quality and service.  Good vibes.  Always the best spot.  Read more We went to STK for Restaurant Week, as a party of 6. We have been to the Coronado STK before. This place is way over capacity, with lots of tables and little room in-between. We were put next to a wall where the table was literally touching  the wall on one side.  The noise level was unbearable, I couldn’t hear my wife sitting across from me.  The food was good, the noise level was bad, the service was above average.  Overall, no need to return. Read more I do want to say that there was a convention in town, but there are always conventions and that is no excuse for what we dealt with.  So we had a reservation for 3 at 7:30   We arrived at 7:15 early and didn’t get seated till about 8:10.  40 minutes after our reservation. I don’t mind waiting 90 minutes for a great restaurant when I DONT have a reservation but 40-45 minutes when I do?  That’s not ok.  We had a small issue at the bar.  Not a huge deal. But when we finally got seated we were told that we had to order everything at once because they are trying to move things along.  Now this would also have been ok if that’s what happened, but it did not. We ordered and waited over 75 minutes for our food to come out   And this was after our starters came out.  When it did, 2 of our sides were cold, one of our steaks was cold and my accompaniment was practically frozen.  Then to top it off one of us ordered lobster with our steak and it never came. We told the server and it still never arrived.  So basically we spent a total of $611 for a cold steak that came 75 min after ordering and cold sides , didn’t get everything we ordered. The thing that made it worse was we were there for a birthday. I think restaurants these days have lost the understanding that when someone selects you for their birthday dinner it’s a big deal.  That means they are putting their trust in you to make it a good experience.  Doesn’t even have to be great or spectacular but at least good.  And somehow it has turned into something way different. Overall just a bad experience. And to pay so much.  Really unacceptable Read more The food was fabulous. Best Sea Bass I have ever had. We loved our experience!  5 stars!!  It was a birthday and they were late seating us so they comped $200 worth of things on our check! Loved our server! Would absolutely go back again!!  We had such a fantastic anniversary dinner. Scott, the manager came and talked to us because of an issue and I wasn’t happy however he made everything right and made our experience 10 times better. Tom our waiter was very informative and gave us a great selection of wine. The food was phenomenal. The crabcake I can’t explain how amazing it was with dungeons crab on top 10 out of 10. Will be back. Had a fantastic time. Read more First and it will be the last to STK. Food was nothing special, calamari overcooked and dry, steak overcooked and lacking flavour and an extortionate price compared to other high end steakhouses like Flemings or Morton’s. Booked due to its convenience to where I was staying but with so many other excellent restaurants in the area, we will not be returning. Service was poor as well with our entrees arriving whilst we were still eating our appetisers. On the positive side, the Tuna tartare was enjoyable. Read more Valet was full. It was hard to find parking. Ordered two medium well steaks, and they both came rare. The waiter took a while to bring the shots we ordered. It’s a very cute place. But it’s super expensive and in my opinion not worth the price. ￼the noise level was very loud! Read more We had a fabulous girl’s night at STK! The sparklers and free shots for the entire restaurant was such a delight, my girlfriends were impressed. The DJ was great, and the energy was amazing. Loved our server Jordan, she was really helpful and a delight. We’ll absolutely be back! Read more The food was absolutely amazing.  The service was great.  The high price would have reflected the experience if it weren't for some loud mouth young attention seeking kid acting like a rap fool, talking blatantly loudly at the next table behind us.  The atmosphere got loud and felt like we were in a nightclub. We were also served a shot in which I don't drink.  Again, great food and service, but the ambiance was under par and it wasn't something my wife and I in our 40's would want to experience again.  If your goal is to make a steakhouse, leave the DJ, club and obnoxious kids by the waste side. Read more Great girls night out started at STK! Our meal was delicious! We started with cocktails and oysters and the experience kept getting better. We all each ordered a fillet (and I also had prawns) and we also shared side dishes; masked potatoes and asparagus.  Again, everything was fantastic. Amazing customer service which included complimentary shots for all of the tables in the small dining room that we were in. Our server shared it was only his 5th day on the job which surprised us. He was great!! Looking forward to going back! Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25688086.webp

Welcome to my food reviews! I want to give you a quick breakdown of how I rate each dining experience. To be honest, you’ll rarely see a perfect five-star rating from me because, in my book, a five-star experience means perfection across every single category.

Here’s how my rating system works:

•I rate each restaurant based on Service, Ambiance, Food Quality, Presentation, and Value for Money.
•I always round up if the score is at or above a .5 (e.g., a 3.56 becomes a four-star).
•However, to earn a five-star rating, the place has to hit a perfect score in every single category—no exceptions! So, even a 4.8 would still be a four-star in my reviews.

I hope this helps you understand my approach to rating and why I set the bar so high for that elusive five-star spot. Happy eating! 🍽️

Review: Javier’s, La Jolla

Average Rating: 4.6/5

Here’s my breakdown of my experience at Javier’s in La Jolla:

•Service: 4.7/5
The service at Javier’s was exceptional. From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel welcome and attended to our needs promptly. The servers were knowledgeable about the menu and offered great suggestions, adding to the overall positive experience. Even though the place was busy, the staff was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed without delay.
•Ambiance: 4.6/5
The ambiance at Javier’s is upscale and vibrant, with a classy, modern Mexican decor that elevates the dining experience. Dim lighting and elegant details like hand-carved woodwork and stone accents create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The place feels lively but still maintains a level of sophistication. Whether you’re there for a casual dinner or a special occasion, it’s a fantastic setting to enjoy a meal.
•Food Quality: 4.8/5
The food at Javier’s was top-notch. Every dish we ordered was bursting with authentic Mexican flavors and made with high-quality ingredients. From the perfectly seasoned meats to the fresh seafood, each bite wa Read more Front hostess is rudest lady I have ever encountered. Then service isn’t to usually standards and experience. Food was ok but not worth the new price increases. Don’t believe the price on the menu as they still  up charge you. We won’t return - RUDE Read more Everything was great. Paloma was our waitress, excellent service, she was very attentive all the time. Great job 👏  Read more Wonderful atmosphere! Service is great and location couldn't be better!  First time at this place and we really enjoyed the experience, the food was good, prices are decent.  We went for our anniversary, waited about 15 minutes beyond our reservation time and was seated in the most uncomfortable seating. We were there for dinner, and it was like we were there for happy hour where they sat us. The seats were low, hardly any back support and couldn’t even put your feet in front of you because the table had a solid square base. Would not recommend for a special evening or if you want comfort. Read more Raised prices too high for the value and lowered quality and portion sizes  Chile relleno was not up to par and told server. He did not take it back  The steak picado was pretty tasty and the chile verde was pretty flavorful  Delicious food and fun environment. I highly recommend a trip there if you'll be in La Jolla.  We had a reservation at 7pm on a Saturday and we arrived 20 minutes early and got seated pretty quickly. There were a lot of people waiting so I recommend reservations. Served us tortilla chips and salsa. After we ordered it took about 30 minutes to get our food. Service was great. This Javier’s is on point but the traffic to get out of the mall took 45 minutes to get out the garage around 830pm. But great experience always at this Javier’s expect exiting the parking lot. Read more It was so noisy that we could not hear one another talking. Paid for our drinks and left  Unfortunately it is too loud to even have a conversation.  Read more We had a 9pm reservation but weren't seated until 9:50pm, which was especially frustrating since we had three hungry kids with us. The wait was way too long, making the experience uncomfortable from the start. To add to the frustration, we were informed about a mandatory 20% gratuity, which I prefer to base on the quality of service I receive. The food was okay, but the service was below average. Overall, a disappointing experience. Read more It was my first time at Javier’s and I gotta say this establishment is absolutely breathtaking! The service was on point and the food was surprisingly incredible. I don’t know what I expected honestly for food but the Molé was literally mouthwatering, meat falling off the bone. The crab and shrimp enchiladas were SO GOOD. Their beans and rice are cooked authentically and you are given chips and salsa upon arriving and the salsa is DELICIOUS! I will be coming back here, not too often though because it is veryyyyy pricey. But definitely for special occasions. Read more Amazing waiter amazing experience amazing staff went above and beyond first and its class with first class experience  Place looks great, but too noisy if you’re expecting to have a nice quiet dinner, I get that due to location you should expect higher prices, but the food is not great.  Being mexican, food is way below what I would expect for the prices. Read more Awesome atmosphere. The food isn’t great but the people  The hostess at this place was very disorganized. We had a reservation for 7:30 pm arrived on time and was asked to wait and will receive a text. After about an hour of waiting and seeing people being seated we proceeded to ask about our table. Where they claimed to have called us a previously but no notification was ever received. They then told us to stand by and we will have a seat. Once again we were forgotten and waited another 20 minuets. We then had to catch the eye of the hostess who had forgotten about us once again. Finally after an hour and  a half of waiting for our “reservation” we were seated. The drinks were good but the food was mediocre. The value was not too great for a $60.00 plate I would expect to receive more than just fries and a cup of beans as sides. Read more The food and drinks are usually amazing but this time the margaritas tasted very salty and sour, I asked for a different one it was so gross I didn’t want to drink it. and she said they can’t do it they can just remix it. They did that and I still couldn’t drink it. Why am I paying all that money for something I don’t like? The food was just ok this time too. Read more Joaquín was wonderful. Food was wonderful. We had an absolute BLAST!  My friend and I love this place and it is our “go to” restaurant for an intimate dinner experience!!!  Javier’s is an excellent restaurant with some of the best Mexican food I’ve had. Highly recommended!",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/26013674.webp

We also had a great server.  We sat on the upper deck. Ambience not up to par with main room on 1st level.

Highly recommend  The outdoor view is fantastic, offering a direct look at La Jolla Cove. However, the service was quite slow, and we weren’t checked on enough.

We had come many years ago and thought we would try it again. My husband has Celiac and we knew there were at least a couple of items on the menu that he could have but we were pleasantly surprised when our server mentioned several others that could be made gluten free. The server was very good and knowledgeable about the menu and she checked on us just enough. The food was cooked perfectly and the flavors were all very good. The wines we had were lovely. We also had the GF key lime pie which was made out of house and it was also delicious.

It was my birthday so we decided to splurge for some caviar and champagne and oysters. Our server asked us if we were celebrating anything and I told him it was my birthday and he said “oh I’m gonna write that down”. I was thinking he was going to comp a glass of champagne or something, but he didn’t which is fine, but it just seemed odd that he made a big deal out of it and didn’t do anything for it. When we asked for some extra bilinis, we got charged for it which I thought was pretty ridiculous when we spent that much money already on caviar and they come with them. He was a good server, but it’s the little things like this that make me scratch my hea, especially with prices as high as they already are.

Our waiter was phenomenal and made us feel like we were the only customers he had. Can’t wait to return.  We had lunch here today and like so
many other reviews we were so disappointed. I had the  overpriced lobster roll that cost $32 and it was absolutely tiny (see pictures). The lobster did not taste fresh and had a funky smell. The fries were overcooked and so salty. My husband had the chicken and pesto sandwich which was marginally better compared to my lobster roll! The restaurant has a nice interior but that doesn't make up for the terrible food and extortionate prices! The place was empty on a Sunday afternoon which speaks volumes about the quality of food and had no atmosphere. I don't think we will be dining there again. If you are looking for good food pick another restaurant. Read more Great food, great cocktails, very nice service, waiter was really helpful, gave us real opinions on the food.

Great experience all around
We will be back  The quality of the food was good. We had salads, calamari, filets, and desserts.  But the restaurant really falls short in quality of service with too high of a price point.  They want to be a higher end restaurant, but charge ocean view prices and appear to have servers where this their first job.  The servers lacked attentiveness regarding water refills, plate, and silverware changing/clearing.  Towards the end of our meal, our waitress asked if we wanted to pay our bill (with the credit card machine in hand) while my wife was still eating her dessert. We found this to be very rude. I really wanted to like this place, but there are many other quality options to choose from in San Diego for this price point. Read more Pretty nice place the waitress was very nice thank you  Muy rico todo.  La muchacha que nos atendió súper amable y de muy buen carácter  John our server was great and the food was amazing  Extremely slow service -we had to wait for main course for more than an hour! And when it arrived one order had no side with it so they had to go back to the kitchen to find the side dish  Food was decent, but not amazing.  Service was very good.  Won't be back because quality and cost don't match.  Fun one time experience, but too expensive.  Noise level way too loud. Why do you need a dj while trying to enjoy a nice dinner.
Service was poor, maybe because it was restaurant week?  I ordered a cocktail and waited over 30 min. Never came. I finally told the waiter to cancel it. It finally did come I  said i canceled it. Instead of letting me have it on the house, it was taken away. Server not attentive. Kept looking at his ordering device. Food was good but barely warm. Don’t think I will go back. Ambiance was beautiful Read more Food is quality is excellent, however on this occasion our service was slow. Previous visit service was not slow. The noise level is high and it isn't due to the amount of customers. I believe the acoustics were not considered in the nice interior design.

At 8:18 I received the text that the table was ready. Read more very cool spot . the staff made sure our experience was beyond what we expected . our server was the best ! gave the best recommendations on cockypoos and food ! ceasar i believe his name was . Read more Poor service, mediocre food especially for the price. Salmon was basically raw in the center  First time visiting. Restaurant is in a great location and quite expansive. Really nice bar area as well.

Ambiance: noisier than we were hoping for. Had to yell to be heard across a 2 person table. But it’s not necessarily a downside for everyone. It’s a lively atmosphere and there was a DJ. We were just on a rare date night and hoping to chat a bit.

Service: everyone was nice but service was very slow.

Food: we were hoping to be more wowed overall. Best dishes were the Caesar Salad and truffle pasta. Tuna tartare was underwhelming, fish slightly fishy. Filet was undersalted and not smooth but fine.  Desserts - cheesecake - not great, the cooked dairy gave an off putting taste. Chocolate cake was good.

Drinks: we got a couple of the various Negronis, they were fine, little too sweet.

Would return to give it another try given location. Read more The tuna tartare was a super low quality fish-
The pizza was absolutely awful-
The steaks were great - rib eye was tasty
The staff doesn’t know the winelist and much about wine what so ever
Great service though - and ambiance Read more Amazing food, calamari was great, service was good!  Food was fair at best. The salmon I had was dry and the asparagus was cold. The noise level was high.  Honestly we had to leave. The restaurant was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other or the bartenders. They didn't even have the bourbon my husband picked from the menu.

Service needs work more than anything. Food is tasty but rather pricey, so worth it if you’re looking to splurge on a lovely date night. Otherwise, the happy hour burger is the move (we also noticed the appetizers on the happy hour menu are the exact same price as the regular ones and that the burgers are advertised as 50% off, which is dishonest because they charge you less because it doesn’t come with the $5 fries—clever).

Appetizer portions were very small. Our food took a bit long but drinks were great. I would give it another try.  Read more Excellence- service and food, everything was very much enjoyed  Really nice place and friendly service. Everyone we tried for restaurant week was really good. We spent time on the roof. Great spot!  Great French food at a great value. Likes the bistro setting.  It was, unfortunately, one of the worst restaurants we've been to. It took 45 minutes for a cold appetizer to arrive. Then, my partner and I waited 30 minutes for moules frites (one of two entrees) to arrive (it was cold and soggy), then another 15-20 minutes for my entree to come, but it was a wrong order, so we had to wait for another 20 minutes for my entree. It is not normal to wait two hours for the meals in a semi-small restaurant. I would be understanding, but there was no acknowledgment or apology from anyone. For this experience, we would not come back. Read more We went for restaurant week and had brunch. I enjoyed all the food; whereas my friend was more so-so. The brûléed grapefruit was excellent but $8?! I know prices are outrageous these days but I think that was my only negative. My glass of rosé was $18. Too much! But, that being said, it was a very cute (quaint) spot, wait staff were all nice, and the food was good. I would go back so I guess that’s a positive recommendation! Just expect to spend a at least $40 a piece. Read more Went for the Restaurant Week brunch menu. Food was delicious, but the plates, cups, and silverware were all greasy and dirty. I had to send a latte back because there were still old lipstick marks on the cup. Read more Very cute French diner! Came for SDRW 2 course brunch. For starters, my  party ordered the avocado toast, savory crepe, and maple bourbon beignets. For entrees, we ordered the omelette, sandwich, and eggs Benedict. Everything was very delicious with my favorites being the Beignets and Eggs Benedict, which I understand are new items considered for the regular menu. 
The restaurant is part of the historic St James building, which also houses an adorable boutique hotel with French decor, old fashioned elevators, and a very nice intimate rooftop bar with spectacular views! Reservations required. 
Definitely a place to discover in downtown San Diego! Read more A fine brasserie with a somewhat limited menu. However, everything they serve is top notch.

Food excellent
Great experience
Onion soup was my favorite, hot, steamy, crust, such an experience Read more Read more The place is cute, the food fine. BUT — we sat at the bar and were APPALLED at the amount of water WASTED by the bartender. She would put a vessel on the sink, turn the water on full blast and just let it run while she mixed drinks and chatted and arranged glasses. Gallons of water ran and ran and ran. I can’t support that reckless behavior, so will NEVER return. Read more We had a delicious Sunday Dinner. Our server, Craton, was very attentive and his service was excellent. We ordered an onion soup to share for an appetizer and the chocolate soufflé for dessert: both were amazing I love the cozy setting. I’ve been there twice this week and will definitely go back again. Read more Bery good food burger was amazing .................  We tried the rooftop. Very limited menu but it’s a nice view and quiet when we went up. The elevator situation in the hotel ended up making us a little late for our reservation but we finally made it upstairs and then walked down the 11 floors because it was taking too long to get one. Read more Excellent food. Had the steak frites and honestly probably one of the best steaks I’ve ever had.  I visited Saint James French Diner after a friend highly recommended it based on some great reviews, and I must say, it did not disappoint.

I went during happy hour and had the burger Parisienne. The burger was cooked to perfection, with a juicy patty, caramelized onions, and a soft brioche bun. It was possibly one of the best burgers I’ve ever had my entire life. I recommend getting the sauce/gravy on the side. It made for a great dipping sauce. The fries were also perfectly crisp and seasoned (and not too salty!)

The ambiance of the bistro was warm and inviting, with a charming French flair that added to the experience. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the overall dining experience even more enjoyable. I’ll be returning soon to explore more of their menu. Read more Food was outstanding; servers were friendly. Highly recommend!  Two young girls as waitresses. Not very experienced. It was not crowded, yet they never even thought about coming to refill our water glasses . Very poor service . But great food ￼￼  I admit, maybe we waited too long to enjoy our sandwich. As we sat down and read through the menu, we couldn’t help but notice that other customers seemed to be eating their food without any visible excitement. This observation led us to order just one sandwich, and unfortunately, it didn’t quite live up to our expectations.

To start, the sandwich lacked enough meat, and the bread was disappointingly hard—perhaps it’s better when eaten fresh. The balance of bread, meat, and condiments was off, making the overall experience quite sad. To make matters worse, it didn’t even taste like an authentic French sandwich.

I recommend that this diner visit Costeaux French Bakery for inspiration on making French sandwiches and better breads. Maybe dinner is their speciality. Read more We dined for my wife’s 30th. It was one of the best experiences I have had out to eat in San Diego. Our server (god I wish I could remember her name but she was one of the managers or Bar Leads) was outstanding and honestly why I’m leaving a review. She made us feel so welcome and not rushed at all. Went into detail about the food and was extremely quick with service as she assisted the other server on the floor. Give her a raise!

Their HH menu prices are HOT (and offered 7 days a week)!
We ate and drank a little of everything.  We started grazing with Pretzels (hot and fresh), Dirty Fries, Mezze Platter (great assortment of Greek items), and the Pirogi (be sure to say yes and add the Kielbasa).  The Flower Sour cocktail was a fantastic rum drink.  For dinner there were 3 perfect Wedge salads, 3 personal pizzas (2 margarita, 1 pepperoni) and a few more beverages.
Our waiter was Ken and he was top notch.  The patio was pretty empty when we arrived at 4:30, but it was slammed by 7:30 when we left.  He made sure all our orders were in before HH ended at 6 and was very quick with all our orders even when the place became crowded.

We sat outside and the music was so loud it was hard to order.

We have had good service and good food here in the past, but today was an exception.  The restaurant was less than half full for a 12:30 pm lunch.  We were seated exactly at 12:30 and ordered lunch at 12:40 pm.  AT 1:00 pm we were informed our food would be right out.  At 1:10 pm, we were informed that the kitchen made a mistake with our order, and it would be right out.  At 1:20 pm, they finally brought our food out ... AND ... there was a mistake with the order.  Sigh...  We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for our lunch.  

The server was less than friendly and didn't seem to care our food took 40 minutes to arrive.  The manager was more understanding and comped us one of the meals.

We'll chalk this up to being a one off, but we aren't in a hurry to go back. Read more Great place, it was beautiful and the best views and the food and service were amazing as well! 10/10  My party of 9 were very pleased with the service and especially Andrew  The view is amazing when you sit outside. the coconut margarita was delicious.

Nice venue to see San Diego’s gorgeous skyline  The experience was beautiful. It was a night out with the girls. The waiter was attentive with a great attitude.

Great place for a good night out Read more We waited for our food for more than 45 minutes.. we got it 15 minutes later than we asked to cancel our orders, they said we couldn’t cancel and gave us a box to take out. Other tables that arrived much later than us got their food before ours.
Even the beverages, they came like 15 minutes later than the appetizer which was really good “queso fundido” I recommend it, but service disappointed Us.
I sadly won’t be coming back we loved the view but service wasn’t as good as we were expecting. Read more Food was average considering price point. The tortilla soup broth was weak, watery and lacked depth of flavor. It felt a bit like restaurant chain food. Service was great.  View and ambience are great. Also great for happy hour. However, food could be better.  Our wonderful dining experience started at checkin. We had arrived a bit early so we went to the bar while the staff went to work to make sure we had the special table requested. The view from the table was breathtaking!

It was restaurant week so after some contemplation we decided to go with the RW menu. Both the appetizers, the avocado hummus plate and the tortilla soup were creatively prepared and presented. The soup was unlike any tortilla soup I have ever eaten and delicious!
The main course was halibut with roasted tomatoes, sikil pak, tangerine, sea beans and verdolaga. This was a remarkably well prepared dish, close to perfection! My guest and I both remarked that it was quite possibly the best Halibut (or any fish dish) we had eaten in a long time! I’ve been eating at Cohn Group restaurants since the early 1990s (Kemo Sabe). Tonight, this one dish was so good, it could be a worthy offering coming out of a kitchen with a Michelin star. Can’t praise it enough for the balance of outstanding flavors!
The tres leches cake was good but not remarkable like the fish had been.
For cocktails, El Jefe packed a punch. The decaf coffee at the end was so good, we wondered if it was decaf (it was).
Overall an outstanding meal to proudly take an out of town guest to! Hats off to the chef who came up with the fish preparation. Will be back soon, especially if that fish gets on the regular menu.

The Fishery Restaurant & Market is located just a few blocks from the ocean in North Pacific Beach.
The restaurant menu reflects ‘coastal cuisine’ with a simple yet serious focus on the best our coastal fisheries and local farms have to offer. The passion that drives Chef Mike Reidy is evidenced by flavors that can only be achieved using ingredients at their peak of seasonality and freshness.
The Fishery was awarded the prestigious Award of Excellence for its Wine List from Wine Spectator in 2018- Present. Our wine list is inspired by the great wines of Europe and their American counterparts and we strive to showcase real, natural, food friendly-wines with a sense of place.

The Fishery Market showcases fresh fish, prepared seafood, salads, sauces and marinades.","Read more The dishes we had were a little hit or miss. The salmon dish was quite oily and a special tuna was so breaded you couldn’t taste the fish. The swordfish was the winner. Nice wine and beer selection. The outdoor seating is lovely except for the hard chairs. Cushions would be a good addition. The ambiance is nice and our server was excellent. We probably wouldn’t go back though. Read more Good fish menu and good wine list.
Unfortunately, the fish dishes are not really warm  The food was very good here, and there was a great variety of raw and cooked seafood. However, the service was very slow-- it took almost 15 minutes just to get our water after getting seated. In the restaurant's defense, we did see that there were servers in training, so they are likely actively working to fix this problem. The food was great (but not excellent-- rated 4/5), but the service left a lot to be desired. Read more Great food. Busy Saturday night. Recommend adding a salad or appetizer to augment the main course. Portions are small.  My husband and I have been coming to this restaurant for years.  Love the fresh fish here and the vibe.  On this visit we both ordered the King salmon.  The fish itself was prepared well but it was too much oil on the green beans.  We felt it didn’t need oil when there was also brown butter.  We had a glass of the Y3 Cabernet, it paired well with the fish. Read more Excellent food excellent service definitely will return  Being charged $4.00 for 4 slices of bread.   Waiter charged us $16.00 for a total of 8 slices of bread.   We didn’t even order the second order!!!!!  We actually didn’t know we were being charged for the first order of bread.

Disappointed in my ahi tuna dish.   Not great.   Had it years ago and it was delicious.    This time no taste and rich.   Needed rice or something like before.

Avoid, however, the fishy black cod in a nearly tasteless sauce. The service tonight was poor. Though the restaurant wasn't busy, the hostess acted like she was super busy, placing the menus in a pile on the table and leaving before one of us had even sat down. Our waiter was friendly and enthusiastic but it took 15 minutes for him to take our order. In addition, waiters were petting a neighborhood cat camped out in front of the front door, and at least one of them did not appear wash their hands after. Then they were asking us about dessert before the last of us had even finished their entree. $50 entrees but the service felt more like a coffee shop.

Do not skip the Fishery soup, so incredibly good. This restaurant always delivers.  We loved the food. Amazing flavors. Everything was top notch!  The shrimp cocktail was delicious and fresh. The rest of our food was not. Very minimal menu at lunch. I would suggest having a fish meal rather than a fish sandwich and a shrimp dish rather than just shrimp tacos.

Established in 1973 in the heart of Little Italy you will find Mimmos is 3rd generation family owned and operated .

Enjoy our amazing food all homemade from scratch daily, using quality ingredients and fresh local produce .

Our popular dishes include, campanelle sausage, spicy shrimp linguine, and chicken parmesan. You can enjoy these dishes alongside a nice glass of wine or signature homemade sangria.

Mimmo's Italian Village was started by Vincenzo Mimmo Gaglio, originally from Montelepre, Sicily. Before arriving in San Diego, Gaglio sharpened his cooking skills in Tunisia, New York City, Ontario, California, and finally, San Diego.

Mimmo's seating areas consist of a charming indoor village, alfresco front and back patio seating.","Read more Had dinner with friends there. 7 of us, and it couldn’t have been a better experience.

Our server was Cesar and he greeted us with a warm smile and kept a cheery and welcoming attitude the entire time, which did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated. This is the best Italian restaurant I’ve ever visited in my life and my wife and I are people that constantly seek out the better Italian food spots as it’s probably our favorite type of food. I ordered the Campanelle Sausage entree… look it up; it looks amazing and tastes even better than it looks. My wife had cheese lasagna, and to quote her, she’ll have to measure all other cheese lasagna against it. We ordered a side of focaccia bread with dipping oil, and the bread was light and fluffy, basically another game changer, and we just had to get another order to go. I know I speak in superlatives, but the entire meal, with each bite, we were in awe; Mimmo’s is the real deal and with every trip to San Diego, it’s going to be tough to cross them off our list in favor of trying something new. The only ‘disappointment’ was the cocktail selection, as there is none except for wine and beer, but that didn’t matter as we had some sangria (Rosso E Nero) and Chardonnay - Simi, perfect matches with our dinner. The value was great, as the focaccia bread was only $4. The entrees are perfectly priced for how delicious they were. If you decide to give Mimmo’s a try, it’s my belief that you’ll need to try extra hard to find something to complain about.

Entrees ordered were chicken Parmesan and lobster bisque soup. That took another 30 min and soup arrived cool.

I have been here before and by far the worst experience.  
On that note there was also another customer flipping out on a waiter right next to our table and making a scene.

That was great as the last time we visited in July the wait was 2 hours.  The reviews on Yelp validated that back then others complained about the wait time so the restaurant has since improved.   Our cook was quiet compared to this other cook who was very loud over the three tables in the room.  I personally thought that cook was over doing his presentation and was satisfied with our cook Fausto and his presentation.   He might have been feeling under the weather with him wearing a mask when normally he cooks without one. Regardless,  I was happy with this visit.

Server was over worked, she hustled, but was covering too many tables. The bar was very slow with drinks. Unimpressed.  Always wanted to go here, but ohhhh so afraid of ""Beach Sushi"" at an amusement park...  Saw some good reviews and wanted a start to a unique date night so here we were.  We were greeted with a smile and seated within a few minutes.  Our server was a delight and we told here we were not in a rush at all (which as it turned out was a good thing).  

The cocktails were good, the Cat's Meow is only ok.  The food was 5-star.  I do not eat a lot of shushi and this was amazing.  Truly.     $120 for two so it is not cheap and we did not order a lot.  One appetizer, one roll, one Miso soup, and two other pieces of sushi plus two cocktails.

Dinner took about 75 minutes (and it was really ok for us as we had plans after so the timing was great), but it did take forever and a day to get the food out.  They were very busy and both kitchens were backed up.  

Overall a great time and so worth the effort. Go and enjoy! Read more The sushi was amazing and the place is so much fun.  The whole menu and vibe has changed. Not sure why but bring it back  Great place, awesome ocean view and location, delicious food, good service and live music was excellent!  Will definitely come back and highly recommend this place!  Great food and great service. Chris was a wonderful waiter! Can't go wrong with the view of the ocean!  Cannonball is always good, the food is excellent and the staff is amazing.  Overpriced fish and a lack of selection for nigiri and sashimi.  The service was decent, not great, when he decided to show up at our table.  Views are killer but it’s not worth the price overall.  The restaurant was just okay. Very limited menu. Oddly the best dishes, simple salmon roll, were the cheapest. Sashimi was a bit off but the drinks were great. Service was slow.  Read more My husband and I spent our anniversary here and I indicated that in the notes so the staff was able to accommodate a table closest to the water, which was so nice!☺️

Our waitress was very knowledgeable on the menu, recommendations, and very attentive! The only downside is the sushi took extremely long to come out, probably over 45 minutes and we only had 2 rolls. The hot food did come out very quickly though (under 15 minutes)! We had the calamari and the Steak Tataki dish for appetizers, which came from the hot kitchen. We order our rolls when we got our appetizers and ordered the Yellowtail roll and the Tuna Sensation. The yellowtail was our favorite by far, so fresh and full of flavor! Tip for next time: order your sushi with your appetizers upfront so the wait isn’t so long.

Other than that, it was a great experience and the waitress even brought us a dessert on the house for our anniversary!🥰 Read more Food was ok, service was great, but it is located in a great spot, a little pricey for the quality of food.  We loved it!! The calamari and lobster roll was amazing! Great service and awesome view! We celebrated my husbands birthday and it was great. Can’t wait to go back.  The bao buns appetizer was great! And the spicy tuna and Philadelphia rolls were solid. Nice that it wasn’t crazy busy at lunchtime on a Saturday  The restaurant location is perfect, for a day time date or casual dinner. The night time not so much. The waitress was kind of in a rush and didn’t take the time to get all of our orders. The food was just average with the exception of the bom bins. I would come back during the day and not the evening. Read more Wonderful experience exploring their new menu! Loved the new rolls and we had wonderful and attentive service. Will be back!  We didn’t receive our food for an hour and a half and our server didn’t check on us. Once the food did come out, he let us know they were out of some of the things we ordered so we had to order new things and wait for those too. I also have a sesame allergy and expressed that to them and found a few seeds on my roll. Sushi was good but expensive, ambiance was nice. We had a big group and were at a round table overlooking the ocean. Read more The main attraction is the view and the ambiance is great. Make sure to order the edamame  Great view I put a comment we were celebrating a birthday when I booked a reservation and wanted an oceanfront view if they had one and we got lucky and had the perfect table.

Read more This is one of the best restaurants ive ever been too  You are paying for location and that’s it. Food took forever and it wasn’t that busy. Rolls were dry and small. Service just fine but won’t be back.  The location is superb, right on the beach with a rooftop patio! The food was excellent, and expensive for what you get. The service was just okay, we had to wait quite a long time before anyone even acknowledged we were at our table. But overall, a good experience. Read more New menu leaves much to be desired. Bring back our old favorites please.  The experience was amazing good food good drinks and great service  Rude server and expensive lobster roll didn’t have enough sauce  I was a little disappointed by my recent experience here. I went earlier this year and LOVED it, the sushi was fresh and I didn’t mind paying a slight premium for the view. I recently returned for an anniversary dinner and felt let down. The windows for our seat were covered in bird (you know what), the sushi had hard rice and didn’t seem the freshest, and service took a long time. Hopefully it was an off day for them, the staff was super nice Read more Canonball had the best view of sunset and was chill and nice.  The tables and chairs could be maintained better in a cleaner way. Food was a bit salty.  Worth asking the customer if they want it less salty. Read more Nice venue at the beach.

Read more Came for restaurant week with some friends. Waited 50min just for appitizers. Sever hardly follow up and had to ask for a manager. We finally received our main course 30min after our appetizer. So an hour and 20min which is below restaurant standard and they weren't that busy. Waited another 20mins for dessert. Finally done from beginning to end of dinner service of 2 hours. Read more Just go. Sweet little mid-century vibe and a clean upscale aesthetic. Food was really good.  The restaurant was only about 30 percent full. The menu looked great. However it took over an hour after ordering to get appetizers and the meal took nearly 3 hours.  Perfect place for a business breakfast.  Great food and service and most importantly my client and I were able to conduct the business we needed to.  We had an amazing time, food was good, host were awesome, Music and atmosphere were on point.  The only issue we had was that we ordered the $35 bottomless mimosas which were really good, the only downfall is that they were served on a cart by this one poor server that had to go around the entire restaurant to service everyone.  I would suggest that they have at least two carts if not more going around. I ordered bottomless but at the rate she was moving because of the amount of people in attendance ordering bottomless mimosas, I only received 3 glasses.  We were there for 3 and a half hours. All else was really good!!! So glad we picked this spot, will definitely go back, just hope that they see this message and will look into getting more servers out there with bottomless mimosa carts. Read more I knew there would be a DJ which I was excited about but the music choice made us feel like we were at a cheap night club in Las Vegas. The music was extremely loud for a brunch venue and it wasn’t at all suitable for the ambiance. We dined there twice for dinner a while ago and really enjoyed the food. However, the brunch was blend and nothing to brag about. I wouldn’t recommend this place for brunch unfortunately. We couldn’t enjoy our time and basically ran out of there as soon as we finished our food. I’d like to go back again for dinner only to see if their food quality has changed.

Egged Benedict with runny white and rock hard yolks. And over easy eggs that were over medium heading to over hard.  For $90 it was a disappointment. Read more We arrived 20 minutes early for our 11am reservation, but were seated right away. Nice! Our party of four ordered two bottomless mimosas, the buttered up & bitter bourbon cocktail, and I had the signature Bloody Mary, which was absolutely delicious! While we salivated over our main course decisions, we ordered and shared the house made biscuit, deviled eggs, and the pulpo and papas; all excellent! A couple of mimosas later, we ordered two plates of shrimp and creamy grits, the short rib hash and eggs, and I couldn’t decide so I got the tocino fried rice and a croffle. My friends love, love, loved the shrimp and grits, but my lovely wife wasn’t a fan of her short rib hash and eggs. She said the meat was tender, but dry, and her over medium egg was overcooked. She still ate half of it though. I love waffles, so I was looking forward to the croffle, a croissant-waffle hybrid. It was perfectly fluffy, but crispy and not too sweet despite the candied walnuts, which were delicious. I would’ve traded everything on the table for another order of the tocino fried rice. It is better than the “sweet and sticky” description on the menu. It was also savory and the rice was so perfectly tender and delicious that I chopped up the pork belly and fried egg and ate everything on my plate with a spoon so that I could enjoy every single speck of it! Brigette was our wonderful server and Maile was our very attentive mimosa cart server. We will definitely be back! Read more Awesome vibe! Great drink options. Great DJ on a Sunday!  Great food and wine, nice service and a great place :-)  We dined with Anthony and he was amazing! Very knowledgeable, descriptive, and passionate about the menu! Food was outstanding as always!

I had one with a grey tea infusion that was delish! The chicken boa buns were also fantastic! We had very friendly service and will be back! Read more Had the pork belly Benedict, strawberry mint cold brew and ricotta pancakes. Great concepts but could be more thoughtful. The pork belly on its own was good but flavor gets over powered by the sourness of the muffin when eaten together. Ricotta pancakes could benefit from a stabilizer to hold the cream, otherwise it get runny quickly. Strawberry mint coffee was the best offering but they serve in a long stem cocktail glass. Looks pretty but you’re getting very little coffee for the price. It’s not an espresso shot, it’s cold brew, so not enough to actually do its job and deliver enough caffeine.

One of the owners was also very friendly. It was a little slow, given that there were no other customers, really, but overall, service was good.

Our recent dining experience at Brigantine on Portside Pier was nothing short of fantastic! Set against the beautiful backdrop of San Diego Bay, the restaurant offers breathtaking views that enhance the entire experience. The ambiance is vibrant yet relaxed, making it an ideal spot for any occasion.

We indulged in a variety of dishes, starting with the oysters, which were incredibly fresh and brimming with flavor. The fish and chips were a crispy delight, with perfectly fried fish and light, golden chips. The burger was juicy and well-seasoned, an excellent choice for those seeking something hearty. The shrimp stuffed with crab was a standout dish, rich in flavor and cooked to perfection.
The chicken with goat cheese was tender, with the creamy goat cheese providing a wonderful complement to the dish. Every bite was savory and satisfying. We concluded the meal with a decadent cheesecake, which was the perfect sweet ending—smooth, creamy, and indulgent.

The service was excellent, with attentive and friendly staff ensuring we had everything we needed.

Wondering how I made it to 95? Well, it's simple: I ate everything that's served here and filled my life with amore! So, Benvenuti! Don't hesitate to indulge in ""Scarpetta"" - dip that bread into the sauce, just like my grandchildren used to do at the stove when they thought I wasn't looking.

Here, Belli De Nonna, it’s all about food, family, and creating beautiful memories!","Read more the server and manager and rveryone working was super friendly amd went above and beyond to make our evening amazinggg
thank you all  Very pleasant experience from start to finish. The food was incredibly delicious, the carbonara pasta was amazing. The service was excellent. Ample parking in the surrounding area.  We had an excellent dinner. Food, service is always top notch.
Pizza, pastas and fish are wonderful.  Wonderful food and service. The noise level is a bit much for us older patrons making it hard to hear each other's conversation. We will come back, but we will choose an earlier dining experience when it will hopefully be less noisy. Thanks for a yummy dinner. Read more Excellent service and staff, food was great and very fresh!  Great atmosphere and decor. Food was delicious and service was great!  Wow, how the wheels have fallen off.  Was wanting so much more it and it fell flat on its face from service to to food to management.  The best dishes of Cesarina are here now and they are not the same. Read more The spacial octopus pasta and arancini were amazing. We’re definitely going back.  We really enjoyed the evening.  Food and service were great!  Wonderful food, wine, and service. I think we ordered 1/2 the me you and there wasn’t one disappointing item!  Read more we had the meatballs and bucatini al amatriciana, both were 10/10. i also love how the wine comes in four different sizes so you can order less than a bottle of wine if you want.  I had an incredible experience at Elvira!  We had a bit of a trouble at first when we walked in the hostess said we could wait inside but another server told us to wait outside until the hostess was ready for us. It was confusing because when we went back to the hostess she said we were fine but that server kept sending us not very friendly looks. Maybe she was having a bad evening. Aside from that the ambiance was warm and welcoming, and the food was absolutely amazing. Everything we ordered was fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. But what truly made the night special was our server, Luis. It was my friend’s first time here, and Luis went above and beyond to make it memorable. His friendly attitude, great recommendations, and attention to detail really made us feel taken care of. We couldn’t have asked for a better dining experience. Highly recommend Elvira for anyone looking for great food and even better service! Can’t wait to come back! Read more Excellent pastas. The carbonara was perfect; no cream. The squash blossom appetizer special was fantastic. The Negroni Alpina is one of the best cocktails I’ve ever had. Our favorite Italian restaurant in San Diego. Read more Overall good experience.  4 of us dined for $400 including drinks so felt very pricey.  Lamb was average and expensive.  Pasta is excellent.  Music loud, venue loud.  Salads very good. Service was fabulous. Read more So good!!! Love going and the experience is always amazing.  Stopped in for an early dinner. They had a great ambiance and amazing service and food. A great spot for Italian in San Diego!  Amazing vibes at the restaurant! I had 'outdoor seating' which had a roof and heaters, and amazing ambiance so I would recommend. Started with meatballs which were excellent. I got rigatoni alla norcina and it was excellent. My partner got the carbonara - it was okay, it was very cheesy and heavy. I would definitely return here. Read more Elvira is an intimate, but open, ""homey"", in a good way, restaurant, with a great vibe.

The printed menu (& website) is creative & just full of fun, whoever does their graphics has a huge talent.

Delightfully refreshing take on ""Cucina Romana"". All the plates we ordered were cooked perfectly, well presented, simply delicious & fairly priced. 

Particularly loved the Cozze al Forno a Legna – baked, as in a wood burning oven, mussels topped with pizza dough, such a great & creatively presented dish. The broth was SO good I asked if they could kindly put in in a container so I could sip it (total missed opportunity not to drink this mussel elixir)! Personally, I think Elvira could add this step to elevate the dish thus the more. Similar to when you order birria, & some other Méxican dishes, they give you a cup of consommé to enjoy.

The Bistecca ai Ferri, the butcher’s cut of the day, was a hanger steak, it was perfectly executed.

Wonderful service, friendly but not familiar, made for a great overall experience.

Think I've found my new favorite spot for Italian cuisine, 100% will be back! Read more The service was exceptional. Super accommodating. Our party was feeling cold and they brought us our little hot water bottles to put in our laps and on our backs.
The food was delicious as always. The carbonara super authentic and fresh and the fettuccine puttanesca was perfect
The desert of little pastries that you fill with Cream and dip in chocolate was heavenly. Read more The ambience is so charming, every design detail down to the cutlery is so beautiful. The service was amazing, everyone was so helpful and kind. Put food was delicious and you can tell love went into every menu item and it was all so so good. I appreciate the “smaller” menu, so many restaurants overwhelm with options and I felt like they have something for everyone. Would definitely come back! Read more Read more Our experience was not as great as the sister restaurant Cesarina. The carbonara tasted like Mac and cheese and came cold! The manager did bring a new hotter plate of pasta but the taste just wasn’t there. The pizza was pretty good. And the lamb chops were decent. Most of the food was cold honestly but we only complained about the pasta because we didn’t want to be a nuisance. The best parts of the night was the classic Negroni and our waitress who made sure to take care of us. Ambiance was okay, quiet but odd layout. We will go back to Cesarina but skip Elvira next time. Read more Amazing experience all around. Food was phenomenal, service was amazing and our server was very knowledgable about the menu. Would absolutely recommend!

I will definitely go back. Read more Food was delish, the restaurant itself is adorable.  Service was great, it’s very busy and tables are close. It’s got a great vibe.  Food was very tasty. But I really don’t like the layout of the menu. And the drinks menu is just nonsensical. Prices (like everything these days) are very high. Service was pleasant.  Wonderful staff, beautiful food with accompanying vino, lovely venue.  Wow! We absolutely loved this place. The food was amazing and tasted just like we were back in Rome. We will be back soon!  The food, service ambiance was amazing!!!! We were celebrating a birthday.
The servers were amazing helping us pick out what to order. The food was probably the best Italian I experience in a long time.
We ordered almost everything on the menu to share.
Can not wait to go back. Read more Amazing food and service, cannot wait to go back again!  The food and the ambiance were amazing.

Unique tostadas, oysters, tiradito, clams","My Son and I ate here for a late lunch. I had come once before right after they first opened and was underwhelmed. Since then, I have heard and seen some good things. We came for the oysters and to explore different options in Little Italy. Greeting and seating was quick, then it took awhile to see anyone again. They seemed to be short staffed, so we were patient. Cocktails where $15-$18 but were watered down tasting so we only had one. The menu is really exciting to read through, but it is REALLY expensive for what you get. (one small order of roasted corn bowl was $17) it tasted really good, but it was 1 ear of corn. All of the items we order were very small. The pulpo carpaccio was amazing, but again really pricey for the serving size. Our lunch for 2 people, 2 cocktails, 2 dozen oysters (which were really good!) 1 soft shell crab taco, pulpo appetizer, corn appetizer, tuna appetizer was $230. I think that's robbery no matter how good the small bites were. Thats as much as a decent dinner for 2. I would not go back again based on the expense and ALL of San Diego's other amazing food options. Also, I used the restroom while there and it was dirty, trash on the floor, out of paper towels and mosquitos in the toilet. Read more Amazing food, amazing service (which is a rare thing in California).
Worth several visits to try the entire menu  besides flys are everywhere in the restaurant, rest are decent. price might be on the higher end, a piece of French toast = $20.  Not inexpensive but excellent quality. I really enjoyed the Parrotfish Crudo special and the Softshell Crab taco was amazing  We sat at an outside table so I can't comment on what it would be like sitting inside. The restaurant wasn't very busy when we were there. We had not realized that the restaurant did not have a liquor license so we were initially disappointed about that. The menu had a good variety of crudo to choose from and our server was helpful in answering our questions. Everything we ordered was very good. Read more Overpriced and extremely small plates. Not worth it. Drinks were meh  Had the oysters,pulpo carpaccio and shrimp ceviche. Spritzer and red sangria to drink. Everything was great and will definitely be back whenever we are in San Diego. Service was great.  Our experience was great. The oysters were delicious and our server was great. Recommend it highly if you are an oyster lover.  Service was nice. But way overpriced. Drinks were sweet and watery. Food was fine but not at $30 a plate.  Had a nice lunch experience during the Labor Day.
Service very good, attentive and friendly.
Quality of the seafood was very high, fresh and tasty.
2 notes aside. We got the Crudo platter which basically includes a mix of every raw fish and caviar, including the famous clams Chocolate. 
Our waiter when we ordered told us that is is a mistake and they have never served them and let us know if we want to go ahead with the order. Surely fair in let us know first, but i find not professional to have the TOP dish misleading the choice of customers. Also generate doubts on the value of the platter.
Second one: it was our anniversary. Clearly stated on our Open Table reservation. They didn't pay attention to that and not mentioned.

Overall i would come back because i enjoyed the environment and the quality of the seafood, but i would recommend to pay more attention to some details. Read more  The flavors were incredible. I just wish they had more variety of ceviche. The Agua Chile was excellent. I was actually using the sauce on my oysters and it brought it to the next level the service awesome thank you Leo for an excellent food adventure. Read more We went during happy hour and the $1 oysters were definitely worth it. The dishes were so picturesque and flavorful. Really loved the concept of small plates and very curated dishes.

We enjoyed great conversation with him. The food was spectacular. So fresh and very tasty. Read more Good food but prices are very high for what you get.  What a great foodie experience! Trinity was our outstanding waitress - thank you for explaining the menu and how it is served!
We started with the Scallops Au Gratin (wow) and the Red Snapper Ceviche. We then shared the Soap de Marlin and Clams & Chorizo, then circled back for another order of the Scallops Au Gratin.  Unique, fresh and delicious.  Loved it! Read more Fresh food,  good service,  100% recommended. Family ambient  1 st time amazing! 2nd time very mediocre 3 rd terrible salty, missing main ingredients!! They DONT KEEP UP WITH THEIR Food items QUALITY!  while not quite ""sushi"" much of the menu is very close to it as ceviche and crudo.  it's very good. inventive combinations.  the guac was very bland, even with their ""special salsa"" added.  While it took some time to be greeted, get waters and a menu, once we got started we had a great time. Oysters were amazing, octopus carpaccio was phenomenal, and the seafood soup tasted as great as it smelled.
The highlight though, were the cocktails. Presentation was on point, and the Paloma I had was the best Paloma I have ever had. Read more Love this spot! Friendly staff, knowledgeable and always fresh ingredients. Excellent wine list with unique finds and great parings.   The food was good but for the price, we expected a little different situation. Everything tasted well; however, not incredible. They don’t have a full liquor license, which we didn’t know. We had to ask to be moved to a table that wasn’t unstable. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. The snow crab claws were great! The staff didn’t seem too familiar with the ingredients in things. Overall, we had a good experience but we wouldn’t repeat it. Read more Muy mala atención. Tengo una patología que no me permite comer grasas y por eso elegí este lugar porque el ceviche no debe tener aceite. Pero todo lo contrario, Estaba lleno de aceite y el ceviche de mariscos tenía una salsa que no estaba descripta en el menú. Nunca más Read more Service could have been quicker and more attentive considering there was only 1 other table dining when we got there. Food was ok. Soft shell crab taco was beautiful and colorful in presentation but definitely lacking in flavor. Blue crab tostada tasted like a cold crab cake. Also found a couple of shrimps in the ceviche that were not completely deveined. Loved the texture of the tostadas tho, almost like a “pop”instead of fried. Definitely expected more given price point. Read more Great Happy Hours oysters. Great location to people watch. Service waste pleasant and professional. We will definitely return  Delicious, artfully prepared food with hip, warm ambience served by helpful and charming waitstaff.  Food was delicious, we had chips and guacamole for appetizer, campechana aguachile, aguachile verde and two orders of Marlin sopes. The appetizer came after we received our aguachiles, and when I placed the order of the sopes I said “two orders of the marlin sopes” and only one order came out.. I had to let the waitress know it was “two orders” once again. We had also requested to be inside and they said for us to sit outside and once a table opened up they would bring us inside, that never happened. The waitress spoke so quietly that I had to lean in and read her lips to understand what she was saying or asking. Overall, service was not as great as expected but food was delicious.

I will say their service was outstanding. They noted a gluten allergy from our OpenTable reservation and alerted the server and the cook. They made a special chicken and vegetable dish custom made that was still delicious. That was very much appreciated. Thank you! Read more Although we had a reservation they did not ask or check us in.

I would definitely go back and recommend the platanos and the yuca fries.  The food was amazing!! It held very well as leftovers too. All the meat selections and sauces were so flavorful.  Food was excellent. However very hard to talk as very noisy.  I found the food to be very lacking. It’s a really pretty restaurant but out of 4 dishes no one in my group was satisfied. Everyone expressed that the food wasn’t good. We ordered the lomo saltado, chili wontons, ropa vieja and garlic noodles. Read more The food was yummy. We tried nearly everything too!

Read more Food is nicely prepared and arrived promptly. Simple, family-style operation in warehouse-type location. Outside dining was not available. Super-friendly service.  Cute place on Convoy, service was fine, food was fine too.  The menu is very thin though - if you aren't in the mood for a sandwich or a bowl, I'd say find another place.  It doesn't help that you can throw a rock and find amazing Asian food anywhere in the neighborhood so as you drive out you think ""Damn, I could have eaten at any of these other places."" Read more The food was well prepared and had lots of flavor.  I liked the fusion aspect of the noodles and the fried chicken breast.  The fries and sauces were very scrumptious.  The calamari was also delicious and so was the fried plantains.  All in all a good dining experience. Read more Read more The food was really good. However, the restaurant is very short staffed. There were two waiters for the entire restaurant which was full. The same waiters were also making drinks, helping with to go orders, and seating people. In essence, it seemed like they were doing everything besides kitchen duties. It was Saturday in the evening. They need to actively look into hiring additional staff. At least 2 more waiters per shift  and a hostess.  I saw one of the waiters hit his leg on a bench because he was seriously trying to work as fast as humanly possible.  I would go back because the food was bomb, but perhaps at opening time or early afternoon on a weekday when perhaps they are not as busy! Read more Good friendly service. Good food.  The food was delicious but there is no ambiance, it almost feels like a place where you would order at the counter - plastic cups, metal trays. The service also felt pretty informal and they brought us our check even though we said we were still eating and they hadn't asked us if we wanted dessert or anything. I'd go again for the food maybe but definitely not for a date. Read more Super cute spot. Parking is always an issue in that area.  Food and drinks were great, but they can work on their service.  Menu has a good variety and food was delicious.    Just be aware to be proactive with server.    They “forgot” one of our 4 entrees until we asked about it.   They did take it off our bill though!   Never brought a second drink requested.   Would try again!! Read more Excellent food. Entrees were brought out at 5-10 minute intervals. Would have been better to just serve everybody at the same time. ￼  Seemed a bit understaffed, other than that it was a good experience and the food was amazing.  Great food, nice staff very accommodating.  Ambience looks like it used to be a burger king but they have done some nice tweaks.  This place looks good but has horrible food. The food came out cold as ice and overly salty. 
The only had one person work the entire front of the house maybe even only one cook. 
I will definitely not be coming back here again. Read more Visited this restaurant for the first time for a Friday lunch with a friend.  So happy reservations are available. The ambiance is open, airy, and just right to hear each other in conversation. We ordered the chopped salad, chili wontons, and the ropa vieja. Yum!!! We both want to return and introduce this place to more friends! Read more Read more Food was good.   Their choice for cut of beef was not very tender but flavors were good.  Very limited drink menu.  I chose this restaurant for lunch because it had a high rating on Yelp. I was very disappointed. Menu choices were limited for lunch. The young man that waited on us was very nice and attentive. Actually we were only one of two tables occupied.  We chose the chicken with spinach pesto spaghetti. The piece of chicken was so overly deep fried that there was minimal chicken left after cutting through the bread coating. The noodles were over coated with thick pesto sauce and not very hot. I took most of the meal home but ended up throwing it away as it left me nauseated.
The cost of $15 was overpriced for this lunch.

Its menu is thoughtfully varied and delicious, including the beverage list. Truly, we’ve enjoyed almost everything on it, but the chicken fried steak, matcha, and tiramisu espresso martini are standouts. What’s more, the service is what makes this restaurant singular. Everyone from host to server to busser is an all-star, and it’s clear that management and ownership are passionate about food and hospitality. Madi is special—worth the drive any day of the week and worth the wait on Sunday morning. Read more Our server Madi was very attentive. Timing of service for drinks and appetizers was spotty.  Excellent experience with Maddy at Madi! Good food and friendly service. They were super busy so timing was a bit uneven BUT not major and the food was exquisite!  I had family visiting from out of town (my sisters name is Madi, so this place felt appropriate.) Originally had 5 guests, but the aftrnoon before, was informed we’d have #6. Tried several times to update 1+ person but they don’t seem to check the app often- or answer calls. I thought well at worst we just add another chair and squeeze in. My dad is deaf so it was important to get an outside table so he could hear. We were also on somewhat limited time due to a friend having a makeup trial for her wedding, she’d have to leave before the rest of us. Our reservation was at 11am, she needed to leave by 12:15.

Unfortunately, we were told by the hostess they could not accommodate 1+ person and would have to wait another hr; the table they had for us could not accommodate 1+ chair outside. This would not do. So we agreed for first available inside. We were told they have other reservations and a waiting list; which sounded like we got bumped as a walk in. I did not find this a valid or appropriate response considering we have a reservation as well, I tried to communicate the day before. They should check the platform or answer the phone.

Eventually the manager stepped in and made it happen. She put together a couple tables inside and, voila, we had seating for 6ppl.

Pros- I appreciated very much the adjustment to get us seated and honor our reservation. The food was phenomenal. I’m not a martini drinker, but the espresso martini was delicious! Our waitress name was also Madi and she was awesome.

Cons- the reservation squabble wasn’t a fun start. EXCEPTIONALLY loud. My poor dad couldn’t engage at all, he was overwhelmed. The food took 40min+. My friend had to scarf it down in 10. I shouldn’t have had to tell them how long we’ve been waiting. Lastly, my sisters birthday was never acknowledged. I put in a special note on the reservation, but it was ignored. They should check their app more frequently.

Overall, would recommend for no more than 3 ppl and a reservation. Read more Fun brunch spot.   Service was a little slow but we were enjoying being with friends so no big deal.    Food was good.   Patio was enjoyable but packed in with almost too many tables.  Went during brunch hour and the food was tasty but it was so loud. There was too many people to be able to hold a conversation. The food itself is good, but it’s very packed. Our server was very good and was doing the best he could! I would recommend but go earlier before the lunch rush. Read more Overall great! A little busy but great experience.  I came here for my birthday with my entire family. Not only was there no fuss about a 13 top, we were welcomed and made comfortable.

Him and Madi (sp?) are appropriately attentive and so kind. 10/10. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/2/49197324.webp

This place is a gem, and the service is always outstanding!  The food is good but easily the most expensive tacos I ever had. You pay per taco and they are mini.

Great waiter, remembered everything we ordered. Everything came out perfect, very shareable portions. LOVED the oysters!!!  Never Coming Back

This is the first negative review I’ve written on OpenTable in years. This restaurant used to be a favorite, but its quality has significantly declined. The second floor, where we usually sat, is no longer open for dinner. Our visit on October 5th was highly disappointing. While the ""Honey Moon"" dish was passable, the rest of the meal was a letdown.

The ""Trojan Roll"" was awful. Despite the appealing photo, the actual rolls had barely any tuna on top, and the waiter’s explanation about lighting affecting the photo was ridiculous—it felt like a scam. The ""Whole Campachito Ceviche"" was also terrible, with an oily sauce and poorly cut fish, as if done in a rush with a dull knife. I also ordered a second round of hot tea that never arrived.

We arrived at 5:45 PM and left around 7 PM, having ordered just four appetizers. The service was slow despite the empty restaurant, and the food was a significant disappointment. We frequently dine out in San Diego, and this restaurant used to be one we visited often. After this visit, it will be our last, and I can’t recommend it to anyone. Read more Read more The poke was good. The scallops were tough.
I would order something else.  We stop by for appetizers and drinks before Home Padre games. Easy, good and nice place to start the evening.

Almost canceled the reservation because of our previous experience. Read more Food was great, service was terrible. Brought this up to management, they apologized and corrected the situation. Seemed like a unique situation.  Food selections were all excellent in taste and flavor.  The oyster sampler was excellent and really fresh.

People were supposed to get a text when their table was ready but ended up checking back in because it took so long.  Once seated, the service was good, though they did mix up our order with the table next to us twice.

The food is SO good!  The outdoor patio is a lovely setting. The biggest problem is the noise from the airplanes taking off and the dance club next door.

The food here is the closest you’ll get to food in Italy. Absolutely delicious.  Excellent service and food with reasonable prices  This was a big disappointment. We were hoping for a better experience but everything from the service to the food was subpar. Especially the food - the presentation was sloppy as if the plates had been rushed or the food almost slid off of them, several dishes were served cold, the calamari sauce lacked any flavor at all, the focaccia was not even true focaccia and more like a flat doughy bread, the short rib was decent but looked like a seagull took a dump on top of the plate...overall it was just a mess. Add to that waiters and runners who don't know who ordered what and who auction the food off at the table by yelling out dish names, so so tacky. We would not return. Read more I want to love this place, but I’ve had so many poor experiences here - food quality and ambiance.  This location is just not as the same level of “awesomeness” as their South Park. :/  It was a great experience, staff is so nice, food is amazing, we just felt a bit rushed out at the end and it wasn’t late at all on a Sunday  Our party of four asked for separate checks prior to ordering, and our server said they don’t do separate checks. She later reconsidered and said she would do it this once. We had to ask twice for extra ice before anyone would bring it, the pizzas were soggy in the center, and the server took a long time to come back to settle our checks after having dropped them off.

I love that you can start eating as soon as you sit down and it’s all you can eat!:)  Some of the worst sushi available in san diego. The fish was anemic and the rice was both underseasoned and way too much in order to fill you when youre doing the AYCE. But even then it's $4 per plate with smaller fish and bigger rice than Kura sushi. Im not surprised how many empty tables were here given the quality. Read more This place was very mediocre, there isn’t any love put in to this place at all. 

There’s about 12-14 rotating different kind of plates that are served and a very limited hot menu. Some of the fish that was put out was extremely dry(tuna) that day and was on the conveyer belt for an hour before being replaced. I came in for the opening slot too so it was noticeable that the fish had stayed out in the open air for a while. 

The soda machine has ZERO gas, which was very impressive. The hostess/server was good though, she tried. 

I don’t think I can recommend this place at all, the variety is very minimal even though the price is decent for AYCE. Read more There wasn’t enough food on the tram. There were 4 gorillas eating all the good sushi before anyone else in the restaurant could get Anything. The waitress never refilled our water until we chased her down. After I sat for 20 minutes with no food to eat at the all you can eat place, the waitress said we could order from the menu, but she never came back, so 1 hr in we asked again and she showed us how to order off the menu and still be all you can eat. Read more Sushi was good, not great.  We have had better experiences at Milano before  1st visit, went mid-week, and opted for the AYCE sushi conveyor belt.   Sushi was good, but not great.  Took a while for sushi to replenish and roll out.  (For $35/adult, not worth it, would have gone to a regular sushi restaurant and order what I want, and spend less). Read more The sushi was very good. We enjoyed having other selections that weren't just sushi included in AYCE. My only complaint is to have sushi's for people with shellfish allergies. Unfortunately more than half the rolls had shrimp in them which was Unfortunate. So for us it was either raw fish or the 2 or 3 rolls that didn't have shrimp. But overall it was a very nice experience. The waiters were wonderful and attentive. Our table was always cleared quickly. Everyone was very nice. Read more The food was good. It did take a while for food to come out and they forgot our rice so a server had to bring it out. Overall good service.  Read more I do not usually leave reviews, but my friends and I were treated very poorly here. First, we were told that it was reservation only so we went online and made one, and then when we came back to check in, we overheard another person telling a group of people that they could wait 45 minutes if they wanted the exact same thing we had to make a reservation for. Then when we were sat down, the Ipad is supposed to be restarted from the party before but we did not know that and sat't going through. We had to flag someone down for help. The guy who was working last night, don't know his name, ignored us the entire time, but gladly helped other tables. We weren't explained how the process went for All you can eat, but when a group came in after us, they immediately got the run down of how the process worked. It was just a poor experience all around and I always give servers and restaurant workers grace, but I felt really ignored last night. Read more The sushi was delicious service was very good. The selection was enough not too many, but enough.  Fish was from frozen source  - not fresh catch.  Not tasty  I will I could do a full review but unfortunately I can't. We decided to exit because of the new price layout. I enjoy the conveyor line for sushi my wife doesn't enjoy sushi but the bowls and Udon. My 7 year son only eats Udon because is allergies to eggs and peanut. We've been going there since 2018 before the new bar and redesign of the restaurant. This time we were told we all have to pay for the all you can eat in order to eat in the dining area by the conveyor belts if not we will be seated away and have to order al le carte. That just tore us apart we understand with how the restaurant has change but having this new policy distributed the family experience. Read more The rules for this restaurant has changed again since our last visit. Now the conveyor belt sushi access is limited to AYCE patrons only. A la carte patrons must be seated at tables and order from the iPad. While the AYCE option is not super expensive (given the average cost of eating out nowadays), the quality of the sushi is just OK. Sushi lovers with a smaller appetite will get better value from going to a proper sushi restaurant and ordering fewer items of better quality for the same price. This is a good deal, however, for starving students/teenagers who can eat in quantities that will justify the price of admission. Overall, still a good place for unlimited food if you don't mind eating less than top notch sushi. Read more There is an a la carte and a buffet side. The selection for the buffet seemed very limited so I chose the a la carte. The selection was just poor and the quality of the food was dismal. The sushi rice was dry and old. The appetiser came last before all the sushi. I just had the impression of the restaurant had no idea of what they were doing. Read more Dissatisfied and disappointed.

Not enough variety.

Some very difficult to chew.

Most of the staff are helpful  and courteous. We got ran out of there for what I assumed was for taking too long and not eating enough?...

Save your money and spend it somewhere else where you can eat and enjoy it better. Read more First time trying the ayce, though I've been before a couple of times. This time it seemed like the chefs were having a hard time producing rolls. My girlfriend and I spent most of our time waiting for rolls to appear on the conveyor belt. The variety was  lacking. The same 3 rolls kept coming by. We ended up eating a bunch of things we didn't really like because that's what was available. Weirdly when we tried to check out it took like 10-15 mins to get our check. Servers were either too busy or nobody really seemed to care. Read more Lots of kids, good value. Staff was kind and helpful. Sushi was decent considering the price.

Came here for the omakase, but apparently, they're not doing it. The sushi was good.  First time to Harmony and everything was amazing! We were near the back left corner but they were extremely attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I have to specifically point out the salmon nigiri. Both my girlfriend and I were dreaming about that bites after the meal. Large cuts of fish as well. Real snow crab in the rolls at a good price. You’ll never want to eat surimi crab again.

Thank you!  Superior food, excellent service. Always full of people loving their food.  Server messed up taking our order and he asked if we wanted our fried rice and noodles with our main entree or before and we told him it would be fine to serve it with our sushi rolls. Upon serving our rolls he asked if there was anything else we needed. I said yes, our 2 fried rice and our noodles. We were almost done with our rolls 10 minutes later and the sides of fried rice and noodles showed up.
And we had ordered noodles and served us ramen instead.  My daughter wanted her roll without jalapeño and it showed up with jalapeño and she picked them out of her roll. It was really a bad experience and no discounts were offered for the mistakes. Read more Food is mediocre at best, service is painfully slow, environment is poor & prices are high when considering those factors.  Best sushi my date ever had was the Calamari Tower.  Everything is good here!  Good food, but the really long wait time for food made for a bad experience overall  Best sushi and best service ever!  Whether you eat inside or outside the ambiance is great.  Service needs to improve. We request multiple time a birthday acknowledgment and they ignored it.  I had a terrible experience ""the worst night ever"".  I made a reservation for my friend for her birthday and so excited since they ask me what is the occasion and they might do a little surprise. We arrive at the place and sitted. We ordered some drink for started and the disappointment started my friend drink was wrong even if the server repeated the order two times. The next thing would be our order which we usually get some sushi and nigiri's nothing that would take long to be served. But we waited an hour for our food to arrive and the server Jade trying to tell us that is the usually wait for the order as if we don't know and trying to keep us waiting by keep on telling us 5mins more it felt like a never ending 5mins. We were sitted outside and we saw two tables were served and finished dine before our food even arrived even if we were got there before those guest. The two of us were totally let out and our orders was forgotten. Servers passing by not even asking anything even though they saw us sitting without any food for a long time. Long story short the food was mediocre considering the price we paid , service was horrible, not so pleasant attitude with the server. And the surprise they keep on mentioning was not even served. I felt they totally are not organized and prepared. It was just an ordinary night. Considering this was a WEDNESDAY NIGHT. Not busy. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone especially if you are celebrating any occasion!!! They are ripped off!!  Bad service! Read more The food was good so was the service a bit pricey for all the dishes .  Read more Took a long time to get our sushi over 40 minutes after ordering due to a big party they had there.  We had such a great time at Banbu. The service was amazing and the food was delicious. We were sat in an area that was more private and that was so nice! Loved it!! Thank you to the staff.  We sat at the sushi bar. Our server was attentive but perhaps too attentive as we were constantly interrupted while talking. When we were ready we would have flagged her down. The bar was mostly empty.
The sushi chef handed our orders to us rather than setting them on the ledge in front of us. This too was an interruption as we had to stop talking, put our drinks down to take the plates from him. Not traditional Japanese sushi service. The food could have been fresher. Some things seemed as though they had been sitting out too long. Rolls and nigiri were ok but a bit bland. Not bad overall but we probably won’t go back. Read more We ordered sushi, sashimi, drinks, and dessert. Everything was pretty amazing.  We love Banbu Sushi, we go there all the time.

We had appetizers, sashimi, nigiri and rolls. The rolls were large with interesting combinations, but all delicious.

We shared the halibut roll and crunchy roll as well as the crispy spring rolls. They did not disappoint. I loved that the individual pieces were cut smaller, but the rolls still had at least nine pieces each. The Sunset cocktail was delightful. This time I felt like I got my “cocktail” moneys worth, if you know what I mean! One of our favorite places, for sure! Read more We have eaten here many times and this is the first time we have ever walked out because of the service. Our reservation was at 7:00 pm we got seated right away and placed our drink orders within 5 minutes. Got the drinks in a timely manner and that is where the good part ended. Then we placed our order which was an appetizer and three rolls which is nothing to crazy. 30 minutes go by and no appetizer or rolls so i asked the waitress who did not do a very good job checking in what was taking so long and she said she would check and she said it would all come out at once and i said that is not what we asked. I said cancel the appetizer and she said okay and i hear her clearly tell the sushi chef to cancel. So we continue to wait and at 45 minutes the appetizer comes and we said we canceled that order and to take it back the woman looked surprised. So our waitress comes back and says I misunderstood which was a lie. I think she was trying to cover for the chef either forgetting our order or messing up the orders period. At that point we had enough so i tell the waitress cancel the orders and pay for the drinks so we could leave. She apologizes but after she tells the sushi chefs to cancel the order they all had a staring problem with me which i did not appreciate i almost wanted to tell them what is your problem. If they were running that far behind they should have communicated to the waitress to tell us. And this waitress had the nerve to  say come on a week day it is way better and i told her i have been here many weekends without this problem and you can check my open table reservations to prove it. I actually left her a $10.00 tip which i probably should not have. So we made another reservation at azuki sushi downtown area and the service was 100 percent better. I will never comeback to banbu and I am going to let as many people as possible not to come here. Read more Second time visiting and I had the hibachi this time. Great choose and so was the tropical martini  Rolls ate nothing special for the price you pay.  Food was super super slow  coming out and they weren’t even busy.  Banbu is my favorite local Sushi/Japanese restaurant but we only go there for special occasions because it’s very expensive and portions are relatively small compared with other sushi restaurants.  I know quality comes at a price but I think they could do better with value.  We would definitely go more often if it was an affordable option for us.

We were left unattended after food was brought to the table. We asked for refills halfway through dinner and we were forgotten again. The server remembered once she made eye contact with us… about 20 minutes later.
One we asked for the check, she came back and said “I added 20%, since you guys are a party of 7, that’s your total.” I told her that I wanted to change it and she replied with “you can’t”.

Service was prompt and courteous.  The menu was not very enticing. The pizza was pretty good & so were the drinks. But we won't return unless it's just for drinks.  Came for a dinner with a friends mom who was visiting SD from the east coast. I’ve been a bunch before, but this was my first time sitting outside on the front patio. The ambience was nice with the plants and decor, however be mindful that being in the flight path of planes arriving at the airport often causes it to get pretty loud with them flying overhead. The inside of the restaurant is SUPER loud and energetic as well, so, out of the two, if you want something “quieter”, I’d honestly still choose outside.

Our server wasn’t great at all. Kind of seemed like she had a bit of a chip on her shoulder. I don’t need someone to be a bubbly betty every second they come over to talk to us, but I also don’t really need an attitude or feelings of being a nuisance either. She didn’t ruin our dinner, so it’s really neither here nor there, but something that definitely stuck with me.

Food was great. Pizza is always a must here. I love it. Also got some delicious bottles of wine as well.

At one point, I was alone on the outside part of the restaurant, and the server had me move to the bar so I’d be a bit less lonely.

This was a special tasting menu and all of the creations by the chef were delicious and creative!  All of the five courses were absolutely delicious.

Appreciate these special monthly theme dinners and the chef’s presence and engagement with the diners.  All items were beautifully presented, tasty and upscale. Soup of the day was delicious and Ahi Tuna salad was superb, fresh lettuce, tasty sauce and nice Tuna. Delightful !  Service was slow.
The pictures on instagram are very fancy. The restaurant doesnt look like it. :(  The food is very delicious, the corn fritters are amazing, the burrata looked beautiful was ok, but the burrata tasted more like ricotta. The chicken amazingly good also the filet those potatoes are very crispy and flavorful.
The reason I did not give it a 5 is because if they notice that people are asking for blankets or putting on jackets they should consider closing the glass doors or putting up more heaters. I understand that for the sunset but they are glass doors, which you can see through them.
They food was cold minutes after it was set on the table because we had a cold breeze. Read more Interesting menu and lovely presentations.  I will go again!!  First time at The Kitchen to celebrate 2 birthdays.  We loved this restaurant...could not be a more beautiful setting and the food was all delicious.  One had shaksuka and the other the grilled veggie sandwich.  Both were excellent in every way--layers of flavor and generous portions.    Other than being really fresh, no idea what they do to French fries to make them SO tasty!  Our complimentary birthday desserts were the chocolate budino--oh mama, now that's a beautiful set of creamy chocolate flavors!!

After 2 weeks dining around La Jolla this was, IMO, the restaurant winner … and we had multiple “winner meals” at several great restaurants. But The Kitchen at MCASD was just good food done well (and right). In fact, the menu doesn’t do justice to the amazing flavors & preparation of the food you’re presented with.

Everyone at the table loved the location and ambiance. The wait staff was pleasant & helpful. It was just everything you wanted in restaurant.

I can’t wait to return next year. And while I hope they don’t change anything on the Lebanese 7-Spice chicken dish -one of the best chicken dishes I’ve ever eaten- I might have to try the lamb burger. It’s the kind of dish you might think is “simple.” But I can tell you - I’ll remember it for years to come. Read more Did not like that an additional “service fee” was added to the bill.  We had the manager remove this.  We were celebrating my friend’s birthday.  The ocean view from our table was magnificent!  Today was our server’s FIRST DAY, so I should be understanding of her lack of knowledge about menu, etc.  The service was VERY SLOW.  We had to ask for salt and pepper, fresh ground pepper, extra lemon for water and fish, bread and butter.  We had salads nicoise, which were OK, but nothing special.   The chocolate dessert was amazing!   The best part of the meal.   The other diners were quiet, and a small adorable dog in a crate was at the next table.   The background recorded “music” was annoying.  I’m willing to give this place another try.

Beautiful setting, delicious farm to table food and excellent service  We tried the restaurant at MCASD on one of their tasting night dinners. It was a lovely venue (the ""outside"" is the patio, while the ""inside"" is wide open too but with a  solid roof) Weather was terrific and we watched the sunset at the end of our meal. We were served a fairly mild cocktail as our starter using the night's theme of melon. Then came a shot of melon based soup. Our first course was a salad of compressed melon and tomato. Second was a  poached lobster with lots of herbal accompaniments. Main course was a wagyu steak with Indian overtones, a few too many chiles for my taste but very flavorful. Dessert was a bagna cauda with melon relish. We also ordered wine pairings and could get small or large tastes. For our smaller appetites, it was a perfect sampling.  We'd definitely go back again.. Read more Service was excellent. Food was very good. We tried a few items on the menu. It was all delish. Ambiance- beautiful view, clean.  Food was amazing. The breakfast potatoes they serve were wild. Honestly the best I've had. The only critique I have is the photos listed on OpenTable were limited; the only ocean-facing photo was in a more limited-seating interior with floor to ceiling windows in the way. They have an outdoor seating section that's within view of the ocean, but is covered by a chest-high cement wall.

I wish more photos of the eating space were taken so we could assess if the restaurant had a better view or not.

I cannot stress enough though; the food was awesome. I got the chilaquiles and my wife got the simple eggs / bacon / potatoes breakfast. 10/10. Read more Wonderful food in a beautiful location.

For the main course, my wife was looking forward to the kalua pork bowl. The food arrived cold and the macaroni salad was too spicy. My wife sent the kalua back to be warmed up and asked for fruit which was provided because the macaroni salad was too spicy. I had the the grilled market fish dish which was ono. The ono was cooked perfectly but the serving of the ginger-coconut basmati rise was a very small scoop. What could have been a very nice lunch experience ended up being average.

Went up to the hostess and let her know that we hadn't had our orders taken, she went and spoke to 2 waitresses, and told us that they would be with us soon. Another 15 minutes went by and the hostess ended up taking our order. She apologized and offered us a free dessert. Tried to order the ribeye (which is on the menu twice) and it was unavailable. By the time our food arrived we were no longer in the mood and had a couple bites and left. 

Bartender was the only good thing about this place, he was attentive and I even saw him notice a table being ignored and took their order. Don't go here if you have any plans after and definitely don't expect good service. Read more Nice, inviting atmosphere. My server was so upbeat and I loved the music. This was my first visit. I visited on a Sunday. It took a while to find parking.

I was the first to arrive (just before noon), first to be seated, and to order. I share this because it made me question some things.

I ordered the lemon pepper catfish with oxtail dirty rice and collards. I also ordered the Alligator Andouille Cheesecake (it's not a dessert), because I've seen raving reviews.  Chef came out and said it would be about 30 minutes because the dish is frozen. Humm ... thaw a couple before opening to reduce the exit time. I wasn't in a rush.

Lemon pepper catfish was 🔥 and piping hot out of the Fryer! It was amazing, just a bit salty. 

The greens had lots of Andouille sausage and sautèd onions, but very few greens. The sausage had been boiled so much that it lost flavor.

The oxtail dirty rice was different and tasty. I was the only one to have it, because they ran out. I heard several people order it. This leads me to believe that it was leftover. However, it was ptetty good.

Surprisingly, nothing tasted good when taken and reheated. Wow!🤔

They were out of a lot of things and didn't have any desserts for the day! I asked why? Waiter nicely said, ""hey it's a restaurant and we get shipments on Mondays"" ... Humm, order on Thursday's for the weekend crowds or perhaps order more and increase order days.

The only detail worth mentioning is the timing in which the food came out. Half of our party got their meals and finished before the other half got there’s. Still not a reason for us not to come back tho! We look forward to trying more delicious items from their menu!! ❤️ Read more Food was a bit salty. Lemon pepper catfish was amazing.

I have ordered takeout from here before and it was amazing and full of flavor. However, this visit unfortunately will be my last. The drinks (Coco Margarita and Long Island) were delicious . The biscuits : although they had great flavor were undercooked and very doughy. Two things I will never give grace to - undercooked chicken and blatantly poor service. We received both. My wife’s wings were cold and in the middle. Our server , Abraham , was more concerned about serving and catering to all other tables except ours . But paid extra care and attention to the table of an employee who brought his friends in for a discounted meal - he loudly boast about bartending and how much money he acquired.

Always love introducing people to this spot!  Me and my fiancé love Louisiana Purchase!! We came this time to celebrate his birthday 🥳 we started with some drinks, I got the Coco (coconut margarita with lime and tequila blanco). It was absolutely delicious. He got a margarita as well, not sure what his was called but he liked his as well. We got the gator bites first which comes with Cajun fries and a honey mustard ish sauce, but the sauce had a tang like maybe there was some vinegar so it wasn’t real sweet, but it was very delicious and went well with the gator bites. Then we got the Rasta pasta to share, and we basically inhaled it, everything was deliciously seasoned, and it was so full of flavor. Then we got the oxtail skillet with mac & cheese and this sweet honey cornbread, again everything was so delicious and cooked so perfectly.

My mother thought the shrimp and grits were delicious. My sister and niece thought the oxtails were flavorful and tender. I had a side of red red beans  and rice and it was good.  

A simple suggestion for the cook cut the collard greens in strips; the large leaves are not appealing. 

 The wait staff was outstanding. 

We could taste that food was inspired by Louisiana’s cuisine.

My plate literally was left as is and when we asked for the check they didn’t even bother to ask why my plate was still full. They didn’t even ask if we wanted dessert. The most embarrassing and frustrating part was that I had invited a friend out for their birthday and I had brought my own cake. They didn’t even do the birthday. Not with our cake or with their own dessert.

Beautiful restaurant.  Service was great.  Way, way too loud.
People yelling and screaming snd the wait staff did nothing about it.  Everything was perfect the food the service and the ambiance 5 stars.  Beautiful restaurant. Food was amazing, must try.  My boyfriend and I decided to come here for the first time. I ordered a cucumber refresher which is really good. The queso fundido, guacamole and twco ducks were good. The shrimp ceviche was okay, it had no lime or salt so it was DRY with no taste. For dessert with had the chocolate lava cake, tres leches cake and flan. The flans was amazing!
Service was not so good. Our waiter never came to ask how we were doing. We had to keep asking other people for a refill on our drink and when we asked for the check it took him 15min and thats because we asked the hostess to tell him. Read more This upscaled Mexican food restaurant is delightful.  An eclectic interior.  The drinks were correctly proportioned and the food we had was very tasty.  The only problem we had was that we ordered three items to share and only two were delivered, which in the end was plenty for us.  The problem was the waiter did not return after the food was delivered to check on us, so that we could notify him that we were still missing an item.  Once he did return, he was very apologetic and took the item off our bill, but it was a little disappointing. 

Would definitely give it another try. Read more The food was delish, great happy hour. Avoid the tortilla soup, didn't care for the recipe/fishy flavor.

Jose was an amazing driver who was attentive and friendly :)  We had a fantastic server, food was fast yet perfect/perfectly cooked, and the $10 valet is unbeatable.  Our waiter Sergio, and Chris the bus boy, were Wonderful and took good care of us. Sergio spent a lot of time explaining all the tequilas to our party of 4 so that we could select for the flights- he was so patient. Both these young men were super friendly and made us feel welcome and appreciated! All the staff was super - except the manager who stopped by our table (thanks for stopping by, guy) to ask how our dinner was going seemed like he was in a hurry and doing it out of habit or like he didn’t really want to listen to what we had to say. (All compliments). He didn’t smile at all, but at least he stopped by, and he asked us if we would leave a Yelp review bc the employees get bonuses if you do!We will. All 4 of us. The only negative was that the booth we were seated had a dirty bench and the upholstery was worn. I was really surprised by that. My white jeans got nasty stains on the seat! Mildly Disappointing. Our dinner was over $400 and with the economy being what it is and the high prices, this was a rare treat for us. La Jolla is just beautiful! Stunning landscaped grounds surrounding this restaurant- it was pretty amazing. Would love to return someday. Read more Good food, good service and not too crowded on the weekend.

This is a place for ""high-end"" Mexican food that transcends tacos, enchiladas and burritos. We had the lamb in mole sauce, and loved it.  I've never had fajitas served to me without guacamole and sour cream.   The empanadas poppers were delicious but the fajitas not so much.  The Chicken was tender and charred as expected but lacks real flavor.   3 of us had 1 drink and an appetizer for $200.    The service was just ok.

Red-O is one of our favorite places.  food was great and our waiter of the night Dylan was attentive and and offered great costumer service !  Food was exceptional. Service was impeccable but the constant BUMP BUMP BUMP of the bass music was beyond annoying and wasn't appreciated during brunch.

It's not a night club nor an atmosphere where heavy bass music is acceptable or appreciated. Read more We have been to this restaurant numerous times and have always enjoyed the ambiance, the food and the service. This was not the case last night. Our evening was basically spoiled by a dismissive waiter (Omar), rushed service and mediocre food. The waiter started off with a negative attitude for no reason and just wanted to push us through drinks (possibly irked by the fact that we had brought drinks over that we had just purchased in the bar yet no excuse for the attitude) and then proceeding to rapidly push us through ordering and then the meal. What made it so uncomfortable was that we were introducing the restaurant to a couple of friends for their first visit and we kept having to make excuses for this not being our typical experience. Then the food. My husband ordered the salmon on risotto with tasty risotto yet a way too small portion of salmon that was overcooked and was extremely thin, almost jerky lot. One friend had a chicken burrito that was just ok. Another friend had duck taquitos (a few small taquitos in a bowl for $22 and a salsa which was too spicy unfortunately) along with a side of beans that arrived barely room temperature and was the only dish sent back. My plate ironically was the hit of the evening which is not saying much but was good - the crispy vegan tacos. The other irritating part was the rushed taking away of dishes while one diner was still eating and the loud noise of this process. This restaurant at these prices should have higher standards for its staff and for the quality of its food. Trust when I say that this is not easy to write when we have enjoyed this restaurant thoroughly in the past. But I am struggling to justify a reason to return. Read more Overall birthday dinner was great! Food was delicious but my surf n turf was a bit burnt :(  Hosted a birthday dinner for my husband with eight of our family and friends at the LaJolla location. We were eager to try this restaurant as we love Mexican food and have really enjoyed Rick Bayless’ restaurants in Chicago. Plus there are plans to open one of these restaurants near where we live, so we felt like this would be a great opportunity to preview what’s to come.

We loved the decor/ambiance and tasty, house made food - we enjoyed the short rib enchiladas and fajitas the most, and the agua fresca as well as the cocktails (margaritas, Paloma, cocorita) were refreshing and well-presented. As it was a birthday we got the dessert sampler - the churros and butter cake were excellent. The lava cake was also good, but my son found a long hair in his bite which put us off that one - we were enjoying up to that point :(

Menu items I would skip: the guacamole (small portion, not very flavorful), tequila flight ($45 for the Casamigos one which is three tastes of approximately 1 1/2 shots along with a ‘palette cleanser - Bloody Mary mix?)

The biggest impact to my rating was the beyond slow service.  While we appreciated not being rushed, 3+ hours for dinner was excessive. Had to ask other servers and staff to locate our waiter  - multiple times - he didn’t ask about second rounds on drinks until we were essentially done with our entrees, brought the birthday dessert after the other desserts were served, forgot creamer for coffee, lengthy delay to get/pick up bill and payment - just highly inattentive in general, which was disappointing and aggravating. And while we enjoyed the dishes we chose, the temperature of food was on the lukewarm/cold side which right/wrong I put on the server given all the other delays we experienced.

That said we did enjoy the food and ambiance, so look forward to trying the new location when it opens and will hopefully have a better service experience. Read more Very good experience. The food was delicious, with very good service. We also appreciated the easy parking. Will be back!  The dinners arrived way too fast.  Not a pleasant experience.

The highlight was the goat cheese, garlic, and bruschetta appetizer with toasted bread (2 whole cloves with soft, roasted garlic to put on the bread) - just the best.  I had the 8oz filet mignon and my husband had the 12oz prime ribeye - both tender and flavorful, along with a shared mashed potato side.  We shared the key lime pie (big enough for two small slices) - also a hit.  Their cocktails and regular drinks are also good, and we like the old school ambience.

We had a great meal although felt rushed by the waiter. He was nice but very scripted so not any genuine interaction only interested in taking our order. After paying our $600 bill we sat there with our to go bags of dessert and a man, I’m assuming the manager, bent down to say there are people waiting for our table and if we were done we should leave. And quickly walked away. Wow!!! We were there for 2 hours, a normal amount for apps, dinner and dessert. We’ve never experienced this even in the fanciest of restaurants. Needless to say it put a damper on our evening.
 The other 3 visits we sat at the bar. Each time we noticed all the staff looked stressed. Everyone looked like they hated their job. Not one staff talked to us or acted friendly in any way. I understand if the experience we had of the management is the norm.
All this may seem trivial to some people but part of our dining enjoyment is friendly interaction with the staff.

Thank you for making my night!  So good!! Ali was our server and she was kind and helpful with recommendations. The tacos are unique and such a different flair than what you will find anywhere else. They recommend 2-3 per person. There were 2 of us, so we ordered 5 and then split them so we could taste a variety. Surprisingly, the filet mignon taco was our favorite, followed by the shrimp and pork. The salsa flight/tour was fun but it is definitely spicy. I’d still order it anyway. :) Read more The food was excellent. We enjoyed appetizers, including the special guacamole and the potato taquitos. We follow that up with delicious tacos and dessert.

Read more We have been to Puesto many times and have never been disappointed! The food and service are always top rated! I need to mention the special treatment I received from Jayden, the host, on this visit. I came by earlier in the day as my nephew was joining us, who is confined to a wheelchair. Jayden spent time with me making sure I found the right table that would make access easy for him. When we arrived for our reservation, she seated us and was as gracious as before, making us all feel like VIPs!
Many thanks!
Kari from Park Place Read more Out door seating, nice saturday evening at 6:30. Party of 6. Good selection of tacos, all very good. Thought the chicharones would be traditional style with pork belly meat, but are the ""out of the bag"" store style, little disappointed at this. Street corn was delicious. Guacamole fresh, salsa blended and mild, not pico style. Drinks overpriced. Server came by 4 times total: order, refills, food check, check drop, average service.(food runners deliver and busser remove plates) Overall, nice experience, great atmosphere, but the cost was a bit much, for 1 drink and 2 tacos, over 35.00 per person. With the appetizers above, we were over 50.00 each. Good food, just be aware of cost. Read more Highly unique gourmet menu.

Carefully sourced ingredients beautifully prepared.  Great menu choices; food, service, and beverages were very good.  Food was very good - unbelievable filet minion tacos. Location on restaurant was  not ideal.  The food is decent, but this place is just way too expensive. I’ve been going to the original headquarters location since it opened 10+ years ago and they just keep jacking up the prices, reducing the portions and the quality. It’s too bad because they had success now they feel like they can take advantage of that this place is way too expensive for what you get.

This is a great choice if you have either a full vegan/vegetarian party or a mixed group.

Beautiful presentation and helpful waitstaff.  It was the first time that I have been to a vegan restaurant. I was amazed at how the textures and flavors could resemble real meat and how yummy the food was. ￼  Food was absolutely delicious! Multiple menus, including Vegan/ vegetarian and choices for meat lovers. Ambiance is nice too and not a long wait for the food.

Food was great and love the ambiance.  I love this restaurant! Obsessed with the ambiance and the food is delicious. The server we had was so sweet and attentive. She knew the menu and recommended some good dishes. The skinny margaritas are amazing. This was our first experience at the restaurant and we will definitely be coming back. Read more My husband and I typically do not go to Mexico restaurants but decided to go to El sueño based on the review. With that said it was one of the BEST restaurants we have ever been to of any cuisine. I had the enchilada del mar which was nothing short of phenomenal.  The menu describes it as being a cheese enchilada topped with a crab, shrimp and seafood sauce, so I was very surprised and delighted when I got the dish and saw that there were generous pieces of seafood in the sauce on top of the  enchilada. My husband really liked his burrito. The food was excellent, the service was very good snd the value was great. I wish we lived in San Diego so we could go back there more frequently. Read more The salsa is not good. Looked like ketchup. The server had no idea when we asked for pico de gallo, she offered us tapatio - or enchilada sauce. We sat at bar and the chips were not good either. We decided to go somewhere else Read more Great food! So filling should have just gone with the appetizers! But left overs were just as good!  Not authentic and poorly executed. Starters are ok .. the rarest not so good   Wonderful experience, delicious food and drinks. Fair price. Ambiance was IG-worthy.  Bartender was wonderful. Food was good.
Learn about new speak easy opening within next couple of weks.  Delicious lunch! Great service! Our server makenzie was so helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back!  Seated quickly and hostess and server were very friendly. My server recommended the rolled tacos and they were incredible. We also ordered a few drinks which were all very beautiful and delicious. For dessert the ice cream and churros are fantastic. Read more Stopped by for dinner and wow! Food was amazing we shared a couple appetizers before going for main course and the portions are generous and taste amazing. The cocktails are so good. The service was great, server was attentive and helped with recommendations. Will definitely be coming back. Read more Great atmosphere at the restaurant. Wonderful food and very friendly staff as well. Would definitely recommend and will be coming back!  This place exceeded my expectations! I have truly never had a better taco in my entire life. Everything is homemade and you can TELL it's made with extra love and care. I sat in the bar area and had liv as my bartender. What do they put in the training here because the hospitality I received was beyond incredible and outstanding, no where else even compares. The drinks taste just as good as they are gorgeous. Liv was super knowledgeable about the menu and answered my many questions I had with patience and kindness. Best bartender in old towne! the other staff members were so kind too, shout out to the management for treating their employees so well because the care and service i received definitely correlates to how well the management is and how good they must treat their staff. I love supporting a family owned business and can't wait for this to be my new spot! you have GOT to try the roasted half chicken in mole sauce, and the elote! i finished my meal with a fun shot called ""the pop star"" which they make themselves, sour patch kids tequila and a pop rock rim?? SIGN ME UP!!!! Liv, thank you again for making my experience so special and memorable, you rock! this restaurant is THE place to be. Read more El Sueno treated my guests and I right!! We had an amazing experience from start to finish with delicious appetizers, entrees, and drinks. Robinson provided excellent service and management came to check in frequently. They told us about their new restaurant upstairs, Tako, and we are SO excited to see what they create!! Thank you to the staff for treating us like family. Read more We came here based on what a local food influencer posted, even after we read all the 1 star reviews on here. Well, we should have trusted the REAL reviews! Definitely not worth it. Our server was rude (the place was understaffed and he was frazzled)  $28 Fundido was small and way too greasy, gristle in all the carne asada bites, tortillas were definitely not fresh (like advertised) drinks came late, and one main never came. If you want a California burrito,  don’t bother, literally any SD taco place does them way better. Don’t let the pretty pics on social media bamboozle you. This place is trash! Read more The amazing bright spot was server Miley. Although she wasn't waiting on our table, she went above and beyond and every single way to help us out. She truly really was the only bright spot. I felt bad for the staff because they didn't have enough workers. So it took a long time for everything. The mixologist did make very unique and tasty drinks. Overall the food was good. The place could be spruced up cleanliness wise though. The outdoor patio looked a bit messy. Read more  Restaurant didn’t have our reservation that we booked through open table, they were also out of several meal and drink options  Out of many food items, poor service and way over priced. Do not recommend this establishment.  I am not sure how this place got it's rating. We were completely forgotten about. Never received out drinks. I had to personally get up to find salt/pepper and to request out drinks. There were out of almost everything on the menu. Which would had been find had we just received good service. Place is pricey for what you get! Will definitly not be returning nor will we be recommending. Read more The food is taking too long to arrive, and overall, the service is not good. For example, even though there are many available tables, customers are being made to wait for a long time.  We originally went here because I was craving sushi, and my boyfriend was craving tacos, so this place seemed perfect. When we sat down they told us the sushi isn’t on the menu right now, but should be coming back in a few weeks/months. Super cute restaurant, but the kitchen was extremelyyy slow. They were also out of 4-5 different menu items that we wanted to order. The poor servers had to keep apologizing for the shortcomings of the kitchen & lack of menu items. The octopus appetizer was great; however, it was our 3rd choice because they were out of the rolled tacos & beef tartare. Ended up ordering the Al pastor tacos, because they were out of enchiladas. The tacos were ok, a little dry and needed salt & lime (which we had to ask for). My boyfriend ended up ordering the California burrito, because they were out of their birria tacos. You can definitely get a better California burrito at any regular taco shop. The waiter did offer to comp us on a dessert, but we had already been there for 2 hours & we were ready to go home.
Overall, I probably wouldn’t go back. Maybe if they have the sushi fusion & fixed the issues we experienced. Read more There was so much hype building for this place, and yet we left so, so disappointed. For starters, servers didn’t know where food was supposed to be delivered, and some tables sat with their dirty dishes on them for nearly a half hour.

When it came to waiting, it took over 20 minutes for our appetizer and then 51 minutes for our entrees — two orders of tacos — to come out of the kitchen.

The only bright spot of the evening was our bartender Olivia, who was the only one behind the bar because the other bartender no-showed unannounced. She was calm, treated customers with respect and handled drinks for all without succumbing to the pressure any solo bartender would have faced. Read more The service was horrible. The food was over priced. The drinks were good.  Bad food overpriced  The service was excellent. So was the ambiance. The food I would have to say was average. The appetizers were really good and My Al pastor tacos were good but the chicken tacos were bland the chicken was rubbery and had no seasoning. Maybe it was just an off day. I’ll give them the benefit of doubt and be back to try it again Read more Possibly the single-worst dining experience I’ve ever had. We ordered one entree and one appetizer + a drink. There was nothing remarkable about our order - no special requests whatsoever. We were never offered chips & salsa, but we noticed every other table enjoying them.  Our food didn’t arrive for over an hour and when it did most of it was ice-cold, but portions were scorching hot - obviously microwaved. Our waiter was completely ambivalent to our presence, but at least three others stopped by with food or drink that we hadn’t ordered - each seemed annoyed with us when we told them so.
It took another hour before we located our waiter with the check (no manager to be found).
I know food service is a difficult job and I respect people that do it (or at least try).
Old Town is fun and it was a gorgeous night in San Diego, so we made the most of it. But this place is beyond bad! 
El Sueño played house music way too loud (you can hear it from the street), the food is lackluster at best and the majority of the staff was annoyed by our presence.
The only bright spots were the hostess (very cordial) and one food runner/busboy named Mehdi. Neither of which could do enough to salvage all we experienced. 
If you’re considering eating here, I recommend you steer clear. It is bad bad bad Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/4/67203305.webp

Located inside a replica of a World War I French farmhouse decorated with fascinating military memorabilia, antiques, and aviation relics, the restaurant overlooks Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, and has a cozy and romantic ambiance, with large stone fireplaces, intimate booths, and beautiful views. The extensive menu features mid-western aged beef and the freshest seafood. Here you will find USDA Choice Prime Beef steaks, slow-roasted Angus prime rib, fresh fish, salad entrées, seafood, chicken, pasta dishes, and fabulous desserts.

Love to bring visitors here because of the artifacts and of course the food is delicious!  My two grandsons really enjoyed themselves; we will visit again.  The 94th is one of the best restaurants in All of San Diego. A great location to celebrate my wife's  60 birthday with family and friends.  Great experience. My family really enjoyed it. Food was amazing. Lots of variery.  Great and fast service! We liked the food and the service. The food had nice portions. We are definitely going back.  Incredible ambiance and so rich in history. We went to the 94th Aero Squadron after attending the Miramar airshow and it was the perfect and to a great day. Our kids loved it and learned so much. The restaurant is rich in aviation history, and the service was wonderful. This is an amazing hidden gem in San Diego and I wish we had known about it sooner. This will be our go to after the airshow for years to come. ￼ Read more Always a good time there excellent food and atmosphere.  I’m always weary about a buffet since it’s usually quanity over quality, but wow! This place was fantastic! Everything was fresh, the array was very well thought out, and the options were impressive! Pancakes fresh to order! Custom built burritos! Fresh and delicious ceviche! Courteous and attention staff! Need I say more? Make that reservation! Read more Omg loved this restaurant! Everything was amazing !!!!  Read more My extended family come here yearly and decided to make a special trip for my mother in law’s birthday celebration. After being regulars, we were taken aback by the changes that were made (starting last March from what the host told me).

For the price, I was disappointed at the quality of the food. The scrambled eggs were very dry like they were made from powdered eggs. The crab legs were over boiled. Meatloaf other food was just okay. The foods that were good were the waffles, bacon (perfectly crispy), and omelette station. Our server was GREAT! Very attentive. It is now “pay as you enter” which was surprising since you are asked beforehand to tip before any service was rendered. Maybe because of the number of dine-and-dash incidents? I’m only guessing.

Anyway, for the price vs quality aspect, we probably won’t be returning. Read more There was a lot of food, some great tasting, majority meh! Price is pretty high for the food served. I enjoyed the bottomless mimosas. Service was great and so was the ambiance.  This is the 2nd time I’ve been here. It’s a great value. The food is always delicious. The made to order service is a bonus. Omelettes are delicious. The carving station had prime rib and various types of sausage to choose from. I love the crab legs, they were great. The dessert options are endless. Of course the bottomless mimosas are not a disappointment. Never an empty glass. The staff are friendly and attentive. They have both indoor and outdoor dining options. I’ve always chosen outdoor as the weather is always nice and it has a garden like feel. Although the indoor is very spacious it’s always full somewhat loud and lots of foot traffic going back and forth to the Buffett. Overall great experience! Read more It was a fun experience! so beautiful and delicious! I can't stop recommending it  94th Aero Squadron was such a disappointment.  We had such great memories of many, many brunches here.  We hadn't been in about 6 months and it Is doubtful we will be back.  First of all, although I can understand the rationale in some ways, it is very off putting to be greeted with a sign stating that after passing a certain point, you can not re enter.   Here are my comments on the food and presentation.  The juice and water were served in plastic solo cups; the soup served in a cheap plastic bowl.   They were very slow to replenish the food - I had to track down an employee finally to get more blintzes.   For the eggs benedict, the English muffins were not toasted as they should be.   The crème brulee was awful!   I have ordered that many times off the menu and it is delicious but at this brunch, it was hideous.  It tasted as if it had been made with margarine. If you are not a champagne drinker, the price is rather exorbitant.   While the champagne was refilled frequently at other tables, our water and coffee were ignored.   We had to regularly track down  The cappuccino maker was broken as well.   On positive note, the blintzes were delicious, as was the shrimp.   The sliced meat was okay but nothing special.   It's too bad that after 25 years of dining here, it has lost its sparkle. Read more First time visiting and I really enjoyed the experience, bison sausage was delicious too.  All the food (potatoes, rice , rolls and prim rib ) were all cold.  94th has always been a favorite of ours...in fact, we were married there under the gazebo!
Their brunch is incredible, with its selection and quality! I highly recommend it for a special gathering with friends and family. You'll love it! The Mimosas hit the spot too!! Read more The owner, Sarah, of this establishment does not do great business. It is apparent that her employees also feel the same after I voiced the unfairness of how they charge patrons for brunch. Since March, they have implemented a new process by which they charge customers beforehand for their party. I, unfortunately, had a couple people cancel due to illness last minute and was charged before we found out that was the case. When I approached the owner, she stated multiple reasons for why we should be charged for those people who didn’t show… none of which made sense.

I ended the conversation by letting her know that her arguing w/ me at the entrance of her business was not great for optics. I reiterated that I didn’t want to argue since we were there celebrating my husband’s birthday. I assured her I would be disputing the charge on my card to which she was not phased. Apparently, this happens a lot according to her Yelp reviews.

Needless to say, I will not be returning. Read more Great brunch and had a lot of fun too. Would definitely recommend it  Read more Food was great, and outstanding service. An experience my wife and I would definitely do again.  For a Friday night, the restaurant appeared to be understaffed. The staff that were there were fine, but there weren't enough. Prices are quite high for food and drink and although the atmosphere is nice, this isn't a beach front property where you pay a premium for atmosphere. No longer a fan of this spot and likely won't return. Read more Here for my fathers 80th bday, staff was very attentive and helpful. Food was quick to come out. Overall unique and cozy atmosphere.  Lovely experience at 94th Aero Squadron. First time there. Two for dinner. We went for my husband’s birthday - he loves the ambiance of an old time-like steak-house and/or restaurant (hard to find in San Diego, believe it or not). It delivered. The entrance is so lovely we stopped to take a picture. The restaurant is placed near an airport or air field, so it has a very cool view out the windows or from the lovely large patio (perfect for a large party outdoors!)

Service was great - the hostess answered me back on OpenTable regarding an inquiry I had…I didn’t get it in time before our reservation but that was my fault. I was so impressed that they follow up with the customer tho!! It seemed like a quiet evening (Wednesday), but the server was polite and thorough and service was timely without feeling rushed in the slightest.

Our food was DELICIOUS!! My husband got the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and he was soooo content with his birthday dinner (and he is a steak snob). I got the Yellowtail with riced caluliflower and it was so delicious I could have licked the plate. The presentation of my dish was stunning as well!

All in all, it was a lovely dinner. Seems like a great place for events, but also a family dinner or couples date. Note:  it is not cheap, but does leave you with a nostalgic romantic feeling. Very cool place. Read more Excellent food!! Great experience!  Highly recommend!  We have been back several times and it’s our favorite buffet in CA. The food is always delicious and they are consistently offering more options. The scenery is beautiful and the service was very good. Read more We have celebrated special occasions at 94th for years. I'm not sure what has happened, but it is absolutely terrible front of the house service and  the food was disgusting. Now they require you to pay upfront.  Brunch prices were inflated from the website.  They also want you to tip upfront. The food was disgusting. The best thing I had there was a hostess doughnut, chocolate doughnut if I wanted to have box cereal I would've stayed home. ￼Our birthday celebration was a very expensive bust.  Very disappointed family of 5! Read more Not the experience it used to be. Too over priced for the quality of the food. I guess if you go drink champagne all day there it’s ok, but if you don’t drink alcohol I would definitely stay away. Cups are all plastic too. It used to be a more elegant restaurant with good food. Read more The building it’s self is adorable and the atmosphere is like walking back in time. We went to the brunch, $65 per person. The verity of food offered was great. Unfortunately, most of the food seemed like it had been sitting in the warmer for a long period of time. Nothing seemed fresh or just made. This may have been because it was not crowded so the food was not getting rotated. Overall, Im happy we gave this place a try. I would like to go back for dinner sometime.

Great place to bring an old friend for time together. Service was excellent,  food was good.  A pleasant enough experience. Nothing too special re the food. Staff were polite and friendly.  The raviolis were so so good. The sauce on them amazing. The cocktail was not bad but nothing special. One of us ordered Spicy Mardi Gras pasta and gave the dish 5 stars. The other person in our party ordered the Harpoon Combination. This dish was a huge disappointment. The meat was all extremely overcooked. For the price we would have expected to have more than 2 shrimp and 2 tiny scallops. The lobster bisque was decent but again nothing special. Our server was attentive and offered to have the plate remade. This would have left one of the two people at our table getting their dinner after the other was already done eating. Next to our table were two large drunk groups who were very loud and obnoxious. Overall a tense dining experience.

We were excited to bring our kids when we went to San Diego on vacation last week. The food was great, but the service was really disappointing. They sat us at a table with the sun directly in our eyes and when we asked to switch they said no. Then they brought our food out so quickly; I hadn't taken a bite of my salad when they brought the entrees. We felt very rushed, but when we wanted to get another drink and dessert for the kids, our waitress was nowhere to be found.

They recommended the right wine. They appear passionate about the food and service. I can't explain it but they exude positively which creates the ambiance. Enjoyed the patio dining. Can't say I like that you have to get a key to use the bathroom. I skipped that while my dining mates endured. The food was good. Hubby had the Italian Job.... sausage, pepperoni; a little salty for my taste but somewhat to be expected from the meat.

We've got something cute for you to cheers to so come pop some bubbly with us! See you soon, XOXO","Do not eat here. The syrup container was FULL of ants. The ants came out when poured on our food. The server didn’t even apologize, she just took the container and brought out another… likely from the same place where the tainted bottle had come from. The restaurant didn’t do any damage control, didn’t offer to comp any of the food that had been ruined, and added 18% auto gratuity to the bill.  I’ll never go back or recommend. Read more Unfortunately, the visit was not good. There was no vodka or rum, so many of the drinks that we were looking forward to, that were advertised and looked delicious, were unavailable. The delivered order was incorrect so one of us ate after the others had finished their meals. The chilaquile sauce was very sour and not enjoyable, and the bacon looked as if they found it on someone else's plate, cold, like the eggs on the benedict. Additionally, the women's bathroom was dirty and disgusting. We had planned this brunch for months and were extremely disappointed in our experience. We will not return. It is a bummer because the pictures looked amazing and our expectations were high. I hope they figure it out. Read more We were hardly checked on by our server. She took forever to bring out drinks. Water pitcher was dirty and warm. Food was not at all what I expected  Cute Atmosphere, but Disappointing Service

The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were adorable and inviting. However, our service was unfortunately quite poor. We waited an unreasonably long time for our drinks, and when my omelette finally arrived, it was cold. Despite trying to make the best of the situation, it was not a great experience for our first visit. Read more This place is not what it used to be.  The only positive was the decor but even upon closer look it was like lipstick on a pig from the ikea like chairs that felt unsteady.  The service was non existent.  We had reservations that and were quickly sat drink orders take by one staff that we didn’t see for another hour.  A different took our food orders that came fairly quickly.  The sweet French toast dish was good but my steak and eggs was overcooked and even if I wanted to send it back no one was around.  We didn’t even get water.  A party was seated next to us and 45 mins later they decided to leave because there was literally no service and we had to take the water carafe from their table.  We asked where our cocktail drink orders were and we had already finished our meals.  They finally brought them out as we were asking to pay the bill and didn’t even offer to comp them and assumed we would pay for them.  We had to ask for her to take them off the check even after she agreed to comp them.  Would not recommend.

Food was ok. We had a party of 8 and half of us enjoyed what they ordered and the other half didn’t. I ordered steak and eggs , my steak was slightly over cooked. My husband ordered the chilaquiles and he enjoyed them.

Restrooms were horrible.  Not clean at all.
Would not go back due to poor cleanliness. Read more I use to come here when it was breakfast and bubbles and honestly even though they kept some of the theme I really liked the first design much better. It just looks like something is missing and I hate the patio chairs/ tables. Other than that the food was good just as expected. Read more We loved the bathroom! Fun food and nice staff! Went for my bday very cute!   I am sad to say that currently, as of 8/25/24 our view of this place is: Inattentive, with no attention to detail regarding ""special occasions"", expensive, and overrated. We came in with a group of 3 right at our 10 AM booking time, with the idea we were getting bottomless mimosas. I wrote in the booking that it was a special occasion, as one of our good friends was moving to Germany the following day. ce** 

This place is for anyone who visually wants to see pink everywhere. This is also for anyone willing to pay $12- $15 for a single mimosa (without tip) and for anyone who does bottomless mimosas on weekDAYS and not weekends. This was a big reason we chose this place and once we got here, the FINE print says during the weekdays... 1/3 mimosa options are filled to the top with cotton candy. Duck Dive seems to do just fine on their bottomless mimosa weekends...

I will say our breakfast shots were very tasty (but also each was $13.) The cheapest bottle of anything (the most economical way to purchase any of the alcoholic drinks) was prosecco and it was $55. While tasty, wildly pricy. 

We made the wrong choice picking XOXO and not our usual Duck Dive in Pacific Beach. Our waiter forgot about us after 30 minutes, likely because of the three large bachelorette parties that came and were catered to non-stop. We never ordered food because of how inattentive they were, it was honestly insulting. Forgetting about smaller parties that arguably have just as much reason and special occasion to celebrate speaks volumes and it was irritating to watch as we weren't even fed... 

We ended up going to TRUST which I HIGHLY recommend. I'd also recommend SunnyBoy Biscuit Co which is incredible with their service and has incredible food. This was not the vibe. It is over-glorified. *Sigh* I really wanted to like it here. Read more Waited over 30 mins for drinks and over an hour for food. Highly disappointed with the service, understandably knowing it was busy but other parties who showed up after us were helped and left before us. Not worth the price, luckily I set up a reservation, I can only imagine how long I would’ve waited if I didn’t. Read more Instagram definitely made it look better than it was. Ambience was basic, food was below average, mimosas were not good & it was a baby glass for the $. The flies were terrible, service was soooo slow. Read more Food is marvelous.  Atmos is superb.  Service was nice but waaaay too slow.  10 minutes before greeting. Now service wear at table.  15 minutes for a mojito (which was fantastic). Or just took way to long and we were in a quiet “just rest” mood and it was still amazingly long wait times for everything. Read more The aesthetic of the restaurant was absolutely pristine, everything was super cute! That being said, the food was hit or miss. The white chocolate waffles were good but the chicken for the chicken and waffle sandwich looked like it was a frozen patty for a McChicken. The portions were rather small for the price, especially when the quality isn’t quite there. Read more We had high hopes for the menu but food was disappointing. We typically do not send food back but we had to send our plate back twice because they served us avocado that was not even remotely close to being ripe. We ordered the grilled avocado. It was inedible and sad. The pancakes were okay. The mimosas were good. Read more We booked a reservation for 12:30pm last Saturday on OpenTable app. We got confirmation of our party attendance. We can tell it was very busy from the outside, hostess mentioned there was only one table open or seating at the bar area. We opted for the bar area but found the live DJ was very loud and decided to move to the table.

The restaurant is beautiful, nice modern decor and seating. They had no AC on just ceiling fans, we were hot!!! Flys were flying everywhere and we have to constantly shooo it away. Several red flags by the time we sat down.

Our waiter “Essa” was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered the summer fruit salad, lobster roll, truffle fries (it was suppose to be a replacement for my lobster roll regular fries but instead they gave me a full tray of it), dury fries, multilayered hazlenut chocolate crepe cake, Bao off their secret menu. We had ordered drinks as well; my friend got the strawberry mojito, I ordered the double shot lemon margarita and a shot of Don Julio blanco. The drinks were weak, watered down.

It took a very long time for our drinks and food to come out; it was really busy and packed inside. We looked over at the table next to us, they had ordered Bao and it wasn’t on their regular menu so we asked for the secret menu by the time we ordered the Bao, we overheard them complained of how rock hard the Baos were so we canceled that order.

We got our food, we were digging in and once the multilayered hazelnut chocolate crepe cake came around, we noticed some fuzzy mold on both sides, we immediately told our waitress. She apologized and took it to the back to talk to the staff, they came over with complementary glasses of champagne for the mold issue. We don’t drink champagne but it was a nice gesture.

Food was just A Okay; nothing special. Was not worth the price I paid. We will not be returning in the future. Read more Such a cute restaurant with great music and great food! They did a great job accommodating us with baby and baby stroller. Food was better than expected!￼  We got the meat board and it literally was one type of curried meat and one type of cheese with slices of bread and a little plastic cup of jam. That's all we ordered because after that came out we were sort of turned off by the presentation, options and delivery of what was on the board so decided to just have a few drinks and eat somewhere else. The drinks were good and fun, the decor is cute and our server was amazing. Read more While I loved the vibe and service was great, the food and drinks were subpar, especially for the price.  For two breakfast cocktails and chicken chilaquiles, my bill was $75.   We arrived to our reservation at 9:02 am and our reservation was at 9 am.
The restaurant was open there was no one to greet us the bar was open without any bartenders there was no waitress no host it was empty.
We stayed inside for about 5 minutes and no one came out it was just my friend and I in the restaurant without anyone.
We left very upset this was supposed to be a special day to celebrate my best friend 40th birthday.
Do not go here save your time ! Read more Probably the WORST service I have ever experienced; was later told that someone called out. If we were told this from the beginning, we would have worked with that, but we sat (party of 15), with no water for 15 mins. Was acknowledged and left just sitting there. The food was BLAND @ its best definition of bland; do NOT GO HERE FOR FOOD. The bartender was great and drinks were fun, but only go to drink (if u decide to go). There was someone who was off and she helped out, which made it somewhat ok, but poor girl. So sorry..we were warned about this place, and it disappointed us; but life is good. Read more The only saving grace to our brunch experience was our server Nicole. She was both courteous & professional. Thank goodness we were fortunate to have the luck of having Nicole as our server. 
Can’t say I’ll return to XOXO, but for those considering a reservation requesting to be place in Nicole’s section would my recommendation. Read more I hosted a baby shower for 10 people here. The decor cannot be beat- super cute, pink, retro. I had a good experience with Serena setting up the event- she answered all my questions and helped me design a custom menu. Unfortunately, she failed to mention that there would be a DJ playing at the same time as our brunch and we would be seated right near the DJ table making it too loud to play games or have a conversation with anyone. I spoke to the manager, Andrea, when I got there and his response was ""No one told me you were doing a baby shower otherwise I would have set up your table away from the DJ."" He said Serena no longer works for the restaurant. I asked him if the volume could be lowered and he said he would see what he could do but the volume was not lowered. He told me he couldn't accommodate us because it would affect the whole restaurant. I asked 3 times for the volume to be lowered and it was finally lowered a little bit, only to be raised back to full volume 15 minutes later. Our server was lovely and she did everything she could to help. Food service was extremely slow and some people had to leave before they even got their food. 
The food was okay. I can't speak for the others but the grilled avocado breakfast was not good. Needed salt and was very bland. 
They also forgot about the custom menus- the server started passing out regular menus to everyone and I had to tell her we had custom pre fixed menus created. They were supposed to be on the table already. She went back and brought them out - luckily Serena had printed them ahead of time. 
Overall, it wasn't a great experience mainly due to the fact none of us could hear each other, we had to yell to place our orders and yell to have a conversation even with the person being right in front of us. The music was lyric-less EDM so it was a nightclub vibe much more than a fun baby shower brunch. Read more Drinks are not that great. Food is ok. Presentation of drink and food is really subpar.
Street noise is AWFUL. I don’t recommend for those looking for an “experience” Read more Service was super slow. Drinks were mediocre and the way over priced. Bottomless mimosas were $5 brand champs for 4x the amount. Ambience was cute. Meh otherwise.  They have cute decor, but lousy food and slow service.  OMG! This place is absolutely FABULOUS!! The ambience, upbeat colors and great staff makes it a GREAT PLACE to eat. The food & drinks were delicious. I tested several drinks, including the Pink Expresso Martini Tower (DELICIOUS), the 🍓🍓French 75 on dry ice (DELICIOUS) and had a couple of flutes 🥂 of great champagne!!! Now the food! When I say I couldn’t stop eating, then nibbling…I mean it! I had the pleasure of having the egg whites only omelette and deviled eggs. I know it sounds like too much egg, but NOPE! I ate almost EVERYTHING before I realized I didn’t need any condiments!!! I will definitely return and will bring/tell many friends!! Thanks XOXO for the Special Invite!!💋 Read more Very cute place, super nice people and the food was quite delish.

Read more My entree of seared scallops was absolutely delicious.   However, the front reception desk needs to raise the level of professionalism.   First, the very young immature lady who called our name was totally inappropriate in how she announced your table was ready.  She thinks she's at a baseball game, loud and obnoxious.  Secondly,  while waiting for our table, we watched the same person acting very childish at the reception desk.  Thirdly, as a frequent  customer,  we requested on Open Table, a table near a window and/or the patio because we don't like to be seated in the very loud and noisy  middle of the restaurant.  Yet, the immature hostess placed us  in the middle of the restaurant.

What a beautiful place to celebrate a birthday with loved ones! The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding!! A definite return!  Great food and waitress. I was just disappointed that I had mentioned it was a birthday celebration in the reservation to surprise my husband but nothing was done. I would not be this upset if I had not watched the table in front of us get something special from the restaurant for the mom of the group. I should not have to tell the waitress about his birthday, in front of my husband, when I made the note in the reservation. What is the point of using open table if they are not going to read the notes we take time to write? We live all the way in GA so very disappointed on this miss in attention to detail.

Receptionists ignored us until her paperwork was concluded. No one else was waiting. After 4 minutes we were just leaving when she looked up and showed us to our seats.

Read more The ambiance is very nice. Our server was very also very nice, but it did take a long time from when we were seated until when we were first attended to by the server. Drinks also took a bit to come from the bar. The coconut shrimp was very good, along with the cocktails, but the steak I had was just OK. Also nothing special about the salad or desert.

Very good.  Advertised on San Diego Restaurant Week as lunch or dinner.  When we arrived, we were told lunch was a typo and the fixed menu was only available for dinner.

Will be back tomorrow!  We were denied a window seat for no apparent reason. We eat early, reservation at 5. We were given a booth in a wind tunnel, but moved to a booth behind. Our server was very nice. The food was delicious. I expected medallions, but got a whole steak instead. Not complaining. I was happy about all of the veggies that came with it. I was also expecting chocolate mousse for dessert, not chocolate mousse cake. A little disappointing. My only issue with the bill was the $8 bottle of water when we asked for still, which has always been tap water no matter where we go. Will request tap from now on. Little things, but I expect more from a pricier restaurant. Read more Extremely rude hostess stand. Multiple employees really enjoy talking to each other, right in front of patrons.

The menu changes between lunch and dinner.
Dinner menu starts at 5:00pm and there is not a lot of things to order compared to the lunch one..
I suggest the restaurant to keep both menu as options so people have more choices in ordering, if not they should update the online system to let people know what they are getting and don’t get confused when they reserve.
In addition to that there was only ONE person to take order in the whole restaurant which makes it hard for us and him to ask on time for anything we need as extra..and when we tried to ask other workers/runners to help us, an answer came from the main waiter: “ I am your server please ask only me next time”.
So let me get this right, I should wait for him to finish whatever he is doing with all the restaurant guests tables and waits in line so my time comes and ask him about what I need? Then wait for him again the same interval time so he can get back to me with what I need ? yea sure, why not.

The bolognese was cold and tasted like canned food. Everything tasted pre-made and frozen. When we told them about it they gave us another plate with hair on it. Then they gave us attitude when we told them about it. And they didn’t even give us a discount or the plate for free. They gave us our dessert to go and smiled and we’re all afraid they spit in it. Save your money. Don’t go here. Read more Food options and quality were good. We just had a hiccup with the meal and I feel like management concern was lacking.  It’s too bad because otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  Beautiful decor. Nice, bright and clean ambiance. Great view (especially outside if it's not too cold/windy.. bring a sweater!) Food takes a while so hungry children (and adults!) might get antsy, and servers could be a little more present and on it. Presentation of food = very pleasant.. however, everyone's food tasted underseasoned and too ____-ey (sweet, over-cooked, garlicky, etc.).. just not perfectly executed. 5-star food wows you. This was ""okay to good"" :) Still, overall, a nice dining experience if you're not too critical. If you expect 4-star food, you won't be let down. Read more Mike our server from Philly was great!!!!

go.  Went to give this place a try but wish I would have been able as other reviews first as many were spot on. We started with cocktails that were terrible. Decided not to say anything and just let it go. On to appetizers, the scotch egg was decent and the hamachi was flavorful but cut very thick which I thought was a bit much. Entrees, I ordered the fish and chips which was completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever. My dish was served with an array of sauces that were over the top and added nothing. I honestly would have just rather had tartar sauce (sometimes less is more) and maybe some salt. I would have asked for these but by the time anyone came back to check it had been a solid 15 minutes and I was past the point of wanting to dress up my now cold fish.

After taking out plates away our server came back to the table and asked me if i didn’t like my almost untouched plate, I gave him a short description of why and he offered to talk to a manager, we were not looking for a replacement meal or to even have it removed from our bill just realized this place is not for us. Read more Overall, a decent experience for “High Tea” time. The food and tea were great, along with the presentation. The only thing I was disappointed about was the check at the end of the meal. We received a check that already included a 20% tip (for a party of 4). The server dropped the check at the table and walked away, without mentioning about the tip already being added or if we had the option to modify it. Read more We went for tea and it was disappointing. The tea water wasn’t hot enough and the food was a bit too much of a “California twist” on normal British tea food.  Great lunch. Great discussion with manager and assistant regarding a private event. Hopefully it will be worked out!  This is a real find. It's cute, quiet and the food is really creative.  Ordered the Scotch Egg and Fish & Chips. Found them to be lacking which is sad.

The Scotch Egg was a rough facsimile of the English favourite, being delivered in a hot sauce with a whipped honey. If you can’t get the basics right then slapping a lot of other things on it won’t help. All in for a pork sausage wrapped egg it was good, but not a true scotch egg.

The Fish  and Chips was at best mid. The fish was over battered and while crisp fell to the American doughy stodge that happens when the fish is prepared incorrectly. Also whoever runs the fryer it’s golden brown not mahogany brown on the fish. The twice fried fries were not good. Then a dizzying array of sides just again smacked of not nailing the source material and making up for it with too much pizzazz.

For those thinking I’m a negative Nelly the place is a solid 3/5. Not worth the massive cost for the Fish and Chips but at least a one off check in. Read more Really disappointed. Fish and chips specialty wasn't all that. $55 per person plus a cocktail brought the tab to over $175. Wow! Service was good, but what is the trend of people to utter ""of course"" as answer to pretty much everything? A simple ""thank you"" or ""you're welcome"" would suffice. Read more Read more Lovely experience. Best fish and chips so far in San Diego  Great Restaurant  . Excellent food . Great service .  Nice fun open atmosphere . Look forward to going back !  Beautifully decorated room open to the outdoors with plenty of light.  Service and food were very good.  There are some inventive twists on Southern California favorites and other items nod to the UK.  We were very pleased with our brunch and will return.  Parking is easy. Read more We went for high tea experience. Service was just ok- nothing great but they include the gratuity so maybe they feel like they don’t have to exceed any expectations. The food itself was good, sandwiches a little dry. The actual tea part was lacking- the water in the little tea pots would get cold super quick so would be nice if they could invest in proper tea pots for a “tea experience” We had to ask for water refill several times for the tea and tbh it was never that hot. I would not call this proper English tea - several other places in SD that do a better job. But if you want to have a relaxed tea & tower experience it’s ok . Read more I was excited to finally go to California English restaurant with all the hype on instagram posts, unfortunately overall it was as ok,the service was very slow even  though it wasn’t crowded.
The atmosphere has a very instagram aesthetic  and has a large outside area to enjoy with friends or family with games and a fireplace in the entrance. I ordered the fish and chips maybe not the best choice very overcooked and didn’t enjoy the pea puree … we also ordered the sticky toffee cake dessert was not as good as I was hoping, very soggy … overall for a San Diego restaurant it was just mediocre at best. Read more A must try.  Great drinks, well made and balanced. The meals were excellent.  My favorite cooking show is Next Level Chef. All other cooking shows are now boring for me and I was excited to try Richard Blais’s food for restaurant week. Considering I’ve watched him critique so many meals, scrutinizing every detail, I figured I’d extend him the same courtesy. The restaurant, while pretty, is located in and surrounded by shiny new office buildings which made me feel like I was eating in a mall. It lacks character, looks like all new restaurants with nothing that makes it stand out to me…besides the fake ferns. I had decided what I was eating already after seeing the restaurant week menu online, except they had upped the price when we got there. I had never eaten a Scotch egg and that was another reason I picked the restaurant. It was a delicious starter. Just enough spice, crispy on the outside, runny on the inside. It was all I imagined it to be but unfortunately it was mostly downhill from there. My friends soup, although creamy, was so bland I don’t even remember what type of soup it was. I had the short rib which had decent flavor, but was fatty (mouthfuls of fat) and cold when I got it. I regret not sending it back but even warm, I’m not sure it would have made much difference. The cornbread was cute, shaped like a corn on the cob, but also, cold. My friends ordered the fish and chips which looked good, a very generous portion of fish, but tasted like nothing. No flavor in the batter. Doughy and bland. We thought maybe it was intentional because they got a bunch of little dipping sauces to try with the fish…but regardless of the sauces, Richard would certainly criticize anything on his show that had no flavor. The fries were fries. The sticky pudding dessert was delicious, way too rich for my friends, so I brought it all home for me to eat. Overall, if this meal had been cooked for me on Next Level Chef, I would send Richard down to the middle kitchen. Not quite the basement, but certainly not next level either. Mediocre. Not going back. Read more Went for restaurant week. Place was empty and we waited a long time for anyone to come to table. There was lots of items unavailable on main menu. We ordered off restaurant week menu 3 of 4 appetiser’s arrived 4th never turned up u til asking 3 times. The salad was supposed to have shaved asparagus. When asked the 1 st person said they were running low so only a little added after a 3rf person came over finally admitted no asparagus in salad!!!
Desert sticky toffee pudding was served cold.
Overall an all round appalling experience Read more Four of us just ate at this restaurant and it was all fantastic. Nothing bad to say, food was the best,  atmosphere was comfortable, and our bartender/waiter, Bruce, was right on top of the service, along with the pretty hostess. Will defineately return ! Read more First time here. Ambiance was great, cocktails and tea were delicious. I was hoping there would be more savory items in the tea tower. Service can be improved, servers was not around when we needed them, check ins wasn’t there. The menu was not explained how it works Read more Read more First time eating here and will definitely be back!  We went for tea and it was an overall disappointment. It is a beautiful place. Our server was doing a job and was going through the steps, but it came across rude and disconnected. We were shown a box of tea and said to pick. It appeared to be an inconvenience to the server when we asked for more information about the tea. The tea was weak and lacked flavor. The food was just okay. We had to stop staff to get things refilled or request more. Nothing done special or extra for a birthday, which is fine but don’t say it likes it’s a big deal when you’re seeking a tip. Read more Ate here for the first time last week, and it was such a perfect experience, that I took my husband back this week to celebrate his birthday. The inside is very large and open, and not as noisy as most restaurants this large- a nice surprise. Staff and service are excellent and seem committed to pleasing the customers. The food is excellent! We've had the Fish and Chips and Poke Ahi-both excellent. I am a small eater and the Ahi was perfect size for me. The fish and chips are the best we have had anywhere-fresh and tasty. Prices are higher than most places we've gone for lunch, but  the food and service are so good, we will go back again.  The fish and chips are actually large enough to share if you are a small eater. The berries and cream dessert is phenomenal! The cream is like a custard, but very light. It is also large enough to share. Read more I’ve been to many afternoon tea spots in San Diego and in the UK and although this place is very aesthetic- the food is very mid and the service sucked.

First off they don’t have a real afternoon tea menu, don’t tell you what you get and what’s included. I have allergies and they didn’t ask or mention there were allergens in the treats and of course I was busy in conversation and forgot to ask. Secondly, their tea is in a tea bag, the water isn’t hot and you have to basically assemble the whole thing yourself. The British would be scoffing at us Americans trying to have afternoon tea. Lastly, the waiter we had was terrible. He didn’t explain what anything was, the jams or the food until we asked. He also automatically added 20% tip post taxes. Tip is supposed to be a percentage of the subtotal. We only had 3 people, it was ridiculous and technically illegal as California has outlawed adding pre tip to any meals. I’m not going to lie, I had high hopes for this place as I’ve seen it on IG a lot but I’ll definitely never be back. Read more Had a great time with my family - brought my mother, mother-in-law and aunts for tea time. We got the tower of sandwiches and pastries and ordered a few extra dishes on the side. I loved that we could all choose our own individual teas (I opted for the boozy tea) and the extra dishes added to the experience as well. The honey chicken biscuit and the crispy rice were my favorites. I love the ambiance of this place and the art deco vibes. It's a perfect place for a girls night! Def plan to come by again. Read more Disappointing, slow service, bacon was good the rest was… meh.  Excelente atención y alimentos! Super recomendable  I've been waiting a long time to come to California English and I didn't disappoint. I went on a Friday afternoon and the restaurant was fairly empty, however it took a while to get service. I ordered a Paloma and it was definitely one of the better Palomas ive had in a while!!! The crab toast-adas were a nice bite to have with drinks and the tartar sauce with the crab was a nice pairings, while the artichokes felt a little out of place and were a strong flavor the overtook the crab. The scotch egg was a nice bite with the whipped honey, SOOOO amazing. Personally I love runny yolks so I wish it was more soft boiled rather than medium but it was still amazing nonetheless!! The thick cut chips with curry ketchup was good as well as I ended up ordering another!! The hamachi aguachile was kind of a letdown because I love hamachi but it really lacked salt and the Broth was hotter then expected. I like heat but I was taken aback as I was not expecting it. Overall, I enjoyed my time there and will definitely come back for my Paloma and to try the chicken Tikka enchiladas!! Definitely recommend coming in for a nice time and good bite Read more 4 of us went for lunch.  Everyone liked the place, service and food.  Definitely have french fries!

DO NOT SIT ON PATIO - THE FLIES ARE HORRIBLE!  They land in your food, on the rim of your drink and on your face.

Quiet surroundings  The food and the service are always great.  I like the restaurant for brunch and dinner.  The back patio is well set up and is dog friendly.  The menu is varied enough that someone can always find something good to eat whatever their eating needs are.  I like the gnocchi with duck confit but I have had the fish, flat breads, huevos, salads and pastas.  The service is attentive but not constantly hovering or rushing you.

Appetizers were not as great - the calamari was a bit chewy, but the main course more than made up for it. The salad was delicious and very fresh.

Food and drinks were great. Came to celebrate a birthday and we had a wonderful experience. Would definitely come again! Read more My waiter was amazing, the food was very delicious. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends. It was the first time my family and I had been there. Would definitely go again. But I was very disappointed that we went to celebrate my daughter’s birthday and I called ahead to see if happy birthday could had be sang to her and I was told Yes!!!! To my surprise our came with a slice of cake with the candle out and no one came to sing happy birthday with us. Very disappointed Read more Great dinner with friends from out of town. Well paced for a couple appetizers before entrees. We have dined here multiple times and always pleased. 👍👍  Good service. Food was okay, not quite right with regards to overall flavor  The food was Michelin quality and the service was better.  The atmosphere, service, and food were amazing. We celebrated my daughter's 15th birthday and our server Miley made the entire experience wonderful and so memorable.  Service was fantastic. We sat outside and enjoyed the people watching. Great location to walk Old Town after dinner.
We enjoyed the Lobester Raviloi, the fish special was Halibit. Meat balls with Bolognese sauce and the Mushroom Gnocchi. The garlic bread was a great addition to the meal.
Food was fresh, and all tasted amazing. The Meat Ball dish serving was smaller than expected so I would recommend adding a salad. Read more Loved the vibe! Dark ambience, lots of candles everywhere, good music & food was really good  We went here for a late dinner since a) this restaurant is open late unlike many others located closer to our hotel and b) the reviews were really encouraging.

The hostess and server were really nice and attentive. The food, though, was pretty salty, with both of the pasta dishes we ordered being at the upper limit of edible, while the pizza was well beyond edible; my wife had taken a single bite and that was all she could take. Our kid commented on this making the customer thirstier, which may be an astute observation for a teenager;-)

The server checked with the kitchen to see if they could tone down the salt level, but this was apparently not possible; kudos for not letting my wife order the same thing again. He suggested ordering something else, which we did; a salad with prosciutto, which was quite good and not salty;-)

When the bill came, it had the original pizza listed but also an equivalent credit, so no problem. Interestingly, the section at the end of the bill showing suggested tip amounts had some serious math problems. Ours was a sub $100 bill, even with the tax, which should never be factored into these calculations but often is (pet peeve), yet, for example, the 15% tip was listed as being equal to $18. Some funny math going on here and I hope this is an honest mistake. I'd encourage the restaurant to check their software.

I don't think we'd go back there anytime soon. Read more Read more The food quality is perfect. The staffs are so friendly and nice. We had amazing experience there. Recommended!  I absolutely love this place. From the decor to the service, the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was def a great experience. The food was VERY good.

Great spot for a nice dinner with friends we had not seen in a couple years. We were a party of 6 and we all LOVED our food! I would go back tonight if I could. The bruschetta was the BEST I have ever had! YUM! Read more I usually love this place but my last visit was pretty bad. We ordered The Fried Burrata, The Gnocchi, The Penne, a bottle of water and the free dessert. The fried Burrata only came with a small slice of bread and the sauce and the fried Burrata was extremely cold. Like felt like it came out of the fridge. The flavor was there but very cold. Either way not worth the price. The Gnocchi had too much oil. No matter how hard I mixed there was still pockets of oil. It left me feeling gross and sick. The Penne was ok. Was not spicy. The salmon was good if you love Salmon then you might like it but I would recommend getting something else. We checked in on Yelp to get the free dessert. They used to let you pick one of the desserts off the menu but we were told it was only a cheesecake which is not on the menu. It tasted store bought and old. Had a strong sour taste. We hardly saw our server and it took about 15 minutes to get our check after eating. Usually love coming here but now I feel like after our last experience we can’t recommend it anymore. The total came out to almost $76 and which did not feel worth it based off what we were given. We were very sad and disappointed. Read more Loved our waiter Michael. Amazing food and perfect location to walk Old Town.  We had dinner for our son's 19th Birthday, and it was fantastic. The appetizers of calamari, fried burrata, and garlic bread were delicious.

Five stars for the food, atmosphere, and service! Read more The truffle gnocchi was excellent and so was the garlic bread and caprese.  Mila was our server and did a fantastic job. Thank you.

Our waitress was very friendly.  The garlic bread and pasta dishes were delicious.  I liked the music and the setting was filled with flowers. I definitely will come back and share this restaurant with others. I had pennewith salmon and my niece had gnocchi. Read more I booked this place for Father’s Day. We didn’t have a good experience at all. It started from the beginning by the host telling us we can’t seat in the patio because we have dog and they have a large party. We checked the patio about 2 hours later and there was no one seating. I understand you don’t accept dog in your patio but please don’t lie. Instead they sat us near the busy street which was not what I had planned to celebrate my husband’s Father’s Day 😔. I ordered a salad for $21 which was beyond disappointing from the size to the taste. Luckily my husband food was good. While we are eating the waitresses wanted to take our plate which usually gives a signal that we have to leave. This shouldn’t happen when the restaurant was 90 percent empty. Anyway, we won’t come back for sure. Read more Always a pleasure going to Trattoria Don Pietro. Service is great and the food is delicious. Easily one of my favorite spots in Old Town/San Diego. 

Plus they also have valet parking, much needed since it can be hard to find parking there. Read more excellent place for great food and drink. Try Brussel sprouts and Calamari for apps, and the Pizza we had was incredible.  Food was small to medium portion size, seasoned ok. Service was awful from server Jennie. Other server was also rushing the plates out. By the time we got our wine, we're halfway with our entre and finished appetizer. No complimentary bread nor did they offer cheese or pepper for our food. Overall, the service and lackluster quality of food is what made this two stars.

Located in Mission Valley on Camino De La Reina, King’s Fish House features a large selection of fresh oysters, seasonal catches, sushi and live shellfish, including lobster and crab, on a menu that changes daily.

We’ve been in restaurants a little while – three generations, to be precise. A long time ago, we embarked on a road trip in search of the ultimate seafood experience. We traveled down highways and byways, pulled up a seat, put on bibs and soaked up the seafood experience: the no-name dishes with unforgettable flavor, the fresh-caught oysters and clams piled high, the hand-lettered specials on ancient chalkboards and the savory simmer of every combination of spices imaginable.

Welcome to the House that Seafood Built.

Come gather with us, celebrate, relax and enjoy a seafood dining experience of high quality, comfort, service and value.","Read more We have been going to Kings in Mission Valley for years. It has remained consistently good. The service is always friendly and the servers are competent. They pay special attention to children and when the kids ordered a shirley temple drink they got to take the cute drink cups.

It is quiet enough for business lunches and great for family dinners. I love the entrees that come with a choice of sides. The fish is always fresh and well prepared. It's one of our favorite restaurants in San Diego. Read more Celebrating my return from overseas, we went out for a lobster dinner.  California spiny lobster season had just opened, so that's what we wanted.  The price was pretty steep, so we decided to share a larger lobster and a shrimp Louie salad.  Worked out well.

We were able to bring out corgi along and enjoy a ""family"" dinner on their patio. Read more Great food wonderful

We love your restaurant  Overall very good especially the accommodation for our guest for gluten and dairy free meals.  Great fish and seafood options.  Beginning wedge came out not as ordered.
Wife’s salmon was raw inside then listened to waiter telling us they cook to medium rare. It wasn’t medium rare. It was raw inside. They ended comping her dinner. Doesn’t really help make a dinner out better.

Wife got the lemon nut crusted wild Mexican white sea bass very substantial serving, enough to take home for another meal. Also very tasty, perfectly done, moist.  We've been going here for years, one of the few real fish restaurants with choice of more than just farmed salmon as in most restaurants, and i prefer not eating shellfish  or bottom feeders at all.

I would definitely order this again!  Soft tasty potato bun, cabbage slaw, cilantro, pickled onion, remoulade and fries! Read more Absolutely wonderful food and atmosphere … highly recommend this place  Great seafood, and great service.  Overall a great experience.  Service was so bad that we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks which were clearly visible on the bar and eventually had to get a new server and my mom still waited an extra 30 minutes for her wine after the rest of us got drinks. Food was also incredibly slow but at least the second server was nice and did her best to make up for a bad start but still about 1.5 hours before we got our dinners. After all that, they only comped the deserts! All in all, bad service, decent food and bad management so probably a roll of the dice if you end up dining at this King’s.

Food came on time  I thought you got to see the pasta toss on the cheese wheel, but I guess that doesn’t happen. One of the pastas was really good. The other was only so so. The music was so loud that you couldn’t even hear your partner across the table or the waiter.

Drinks were really good. Read more Service was great, loved the portions on the food, and everything was seasoned well.  Read more We had a fun and delicious late lunch experience, particularly thanks to our server Bebe.  I found this place to be incredibly overrated. The service was terrible. Our waiter, Armando, was hardly ever around, despite it being 4 PM and not busy. We came specifically to see the cheese wheel while our food was being prepared, and after asking him three times to let us know, he completely forgot.

We had to repeatedly ask for drink refills, for our table to be cleared, and even for bread—what kind of Italian restaurant makes you ask for bread? We waited over an hour for our food, and when it finally arrived, two Fettuccini Alfredo dishes were cold. The chicken was chewy and tasted like airline food, and the noodles were cold too! We sent it back, only to receive a microwaved version drenched in sauce to cover up the poor quality. We ended up bringing it home for the dogs.

To make matters worse, the manager, Rumaldo, never came over to address our concerns. Only the woman who took over for Armando apologized, offered a discount, and gave us two desserts, which were both tasteless. The tiramisu resembled cinnamon cake, and we had no idea what the other dessert was supposed to be.

I chose your restaurant to celebrate my 50th birthday, and it was disappointing that they didn’t acknowledge it at all—instead, they ruined it. I would have preferred to stay home for an authentic Italian meal cooked by my mom.

A note to the owner: consider holding a customer service training session for your staff. Armando’s stained apron and slurred speech gave a poor impression. When something is clearly wrong, a manager should step in.

We weren’t the only dissatisfied customers; the table behind us missed happy hour prices because they waited so long without recognition. Please do better—and for the love of food, improve your bread; it’s tasteless! Read more Tourist trap.  Food was awful, feel like we got fleeced.   Really disappointed.

Great food and beautiful atmosphere! ! We were sad that the don’t anything for celebrations or birthdays! It’s strange because they ask you if you are celebrating anything when you make your reservation online but don’t do anything for celebrations! Read more I recently dined at Vincenzo with a group of eight, and overall, it was a pleasant experience marked by standout service and some delicious food, though there were a few bumps along the way.

First, let’s talk about the service. Our server was attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed throughout the evening. It’s clear that the staff at Vincenzo genuinely care about their guests, which added a welcoming touch to our meal.

As for the food, while there were definitely highlights, not all dishes lived up to expectations. The pistachio burrata pizza, for example, sounded promising but fell short. It didn’t come with a full serving of burrata, and the pistachio flavor was subtle to the point of being almost undetectable. On the other hand, several other dishes we tried were quite good, showcasing the restaurant's potential.

The drink menu also had its strengths, with a solid selection of cocktails. However, I found the mocktails to be a bit pricey relative to their presentation and flavor. If you’re looking to indulge in a non-alcoholic option, you might want to manage your expectations.

One logistical hiccup worth mentioning was the splitting of the bill. With eight of us dining, it was surprising to learn that the restaurant could only accommodate splitting the bill into three separate checks. This created a bit of confusion and frustration, and I’m unsure whether it’s a common issue in San Diego or a specific policy at Vincenzo.

In summary, Vincenzo has a lot to offer in terms of atmosphere and service, and while some dishes shine, others may leave you wanting. If you’re in the area, it’s worth a visit, but maybe keep an eye on the menu before diving in!

The prices are on the high end, and for this level of cost and location, the level of service is greatly lacking.

We were seated in a largely empty secondary dining room on a busy Sunday. The outside tables were full, as were the inside section as you walk in the restaurant.

We were seated in a booth. The floor of the booth was filthy. Napkins from prior guests, empty packages from sweeteners and such. The floor was sticky.

Our waitress was charming and helpful. There were no visible bus boys, and it was up to the waitress to clear tables. A table in front of us was left with used plates from what appeared to be disgruntled patrons who left in a hurry without eating or even touching a fresh cocktail. That food remained during our entire meal. It became the location for waiters to dump dirty plates. Not exactly the view one would expect from a high end restaurant.

The waitress, and not the support staff (as there was none) refilled our water glasses.

An appetizer arrived without plates to share. We asked a waiter for plates, and he acknowledged us and disappeared. The waitress finally brought some plates albeit the appetizer was now cooled.

The main dishes arrived in 3 deliveries for our party of six.

When we finished the plates were left on the table until we left.

Since we weren't leaving right away, we stacked them in a corner, but there was no one to bus the table.

Since we had a birthday, a complimentary slice of cake was brought over by the waitress.

When we got up to leave several bus boys arrived to clean the table, but no effort was made to look UNDER the table. (We watched.)

For the price point I certainly expected better. The management would be wise to visit Romesco's in Bonita to see what high level service is like. This was not it.

Food:

Food was good. We all ordered from the cheese wheel selection. The portions were smaller than expected, however it was very rich and therefore more would have likely been excessive. Read more I was super excited to go to this restaurant as I read nothing but decent reviews on their dining experiences. The host sat us in the back near a ramp area there was a lot of trash on the floor that looked like they just brushed off the tables and didn’t sweep. Before we got our food there was a mop bucket and mop and just behind us the entire time that smelt great but extremely overwhelming and not wanting to smell cleaning chemicals the entire time during our dining experience. The experience was more of a “hurry up eat and get out”. Read more I was so disappointed with this resto. The place was so noisy, the server was overworked. The food was overrated. This was an instagram recommendation and from now on i will be hesitant to believe social media.one of the worst experiences of my gastronomic life. Read more The food was delicious but the service was absolutely terrible. There were empty tables all around us but we NEVER got checked on by our waiter. We had to flag him down and ask other people working there to tell him we wanted to order and then again that we wanted a second drink. We sat at the table with empty drinks for over 10 minutes. When he did come over he acted like we were bothering him and was not pleasant at all. Would not go back there's so many good restaurant's in Littel Italy with way better service! Read more What an awesome experience, food was delicious and our server was amazing. Inside the restaurant is very nice and a good take on modern dining. Definitely coming back!  Fun ambiance, amazing service, food doesn’t take too long, awesome drink menu with good deals for large groups, and delicious food! The pizzas are outstanding  Venue music was so loud you had to shout across the table. Food arrived like warm.  I came to celebrate my birthday with my friends we all have a nice time.
The food was wonderful and the service since we came was excellent no complaints.

Definitely be back soon.  Great food and great service. The location is also amazing right in old town San Diego  The food was fantastic! The setting was fun and available parking was a bonus!  We came to enjoy the last day of restaurant week, but when we asked for the menu, the server related that they were completely out of the menu, but we can log into our phone to check out the menu. This was not incorrect information as I observed others that were seated after us receive a physical copy of the San Diego restaurant week menu.. ￼ Overall, $68 with tax and tip for lunch was not worth the food quality received. The lobster chowder appeared to be microwaved, although the shrimp was very good as we ordered different items for each of the three courses. ￼ We’ve had better Baja fish bowls and tacos as well as fried ice cream and churros so nothing to ring home about.

The Baja buckets were delicious and the SD Restaurant week menu was great!  The Old Town location  is dialed in for great service and consistently serving tasty food , yummy, yummy, yummy and great cocktails …we had reservations, had to wait 20 minutes today to be seated as people were here scarfing up the delicious food….once seated, Luis G. Came by rather quickly with a full basket of yummy tortilla chips, took our drink order and we were off to their large salsa bar that has 12-15 self serve varieties of salsa, super yummy…Donna had a Pina Colada & I tried their Spicy Watermelon & Cucumber Rita, both were great tasting 😊, Donna loved her favorite  dish, the tasty Lobster Roll,  and I tried their Seafood Lovers Combo, which has  a Baja style lobster tail, 8 Baja Style Shrimp, Cilantro Lime Rice and Ranchero Beans, and it comes with Awesome tasting Lobster Corn Chowder, all of it was scrumptious…I managed to finish up with some Fried Ice Cream which was delicious ..another plus is they have their own parking lot at this location….it was a bit noisy inside, however everyone is having a good time, 3 piece band started singing at 5, mix of oldies, country, etc., I was lovin the music, however we had to get home to watch the Padres beat the Diamondbacks today 5-0, can’t wait to come back here, great service, great food ❤️ Read more Food was great.  The salsa bar was great. My wife and went there for our anniversary and enjoyed ourselves.  Food was good, San Diego restaurant menu was worth it!! Variety of food offerings, the protein options were best part lobster/shrimp/skirt steak were great. Sides not so much but all you eat chip and salsa was great too!! Read more I have eaten here at least 3 times now and this was by far the worst experience. I know it’s noisy because it’s right by the 5 freeway and normally I wouldn’t mind but our server was terrible. She was not attentive, not focused, not nice and kept forgetting everything. We had to ask for everything and she would still forget. Plus she would say loudly, you know that’s not free right? I’m a paying customer and would NEVER ask for anything for free. So rude. Maybe she had too many tables or larger parties but it was not busy yet as we went early to beat the dinner rush. The food was good but it got cold as we waited for other items. They brought out our appetizers with dinner. Just terrible. I would consider going back but if she’s our server I would leave immediately. Read more Read more Nice family birthday party excellent location excellent food  The food was very good it was restaurant week the prices were great during this promotions! I don’t like feeling rushed we got our soup so quickly after the entree which ended up being cold. It was a choice should the soup get cold or the 3 tacos. Good service would be for the waiter to be aware of when you’re done with the appetizer to bring out the main dish. This was not the case or I would give more stars. Read more Worst Margarita ever!! Had it before no alcohol. Had to keep asking waiter for things and repeating myself.  Photographer was annoying cant and won't take no for an answer .  We had a wonderful time ‼️
So we made another reservation on 10/18/24
We driving all way from Costa Mesa,Ca  one of the lobsters was overcooked where it deteriorated easily  Experience was fun! There’s a kind lady that walks around the restaurant to take group photos & asks if you would like one. My group and I did politely decline as it was a hot and sweaty day. Overall enjoyed the food and ambience! Our only small complaint was waiting for our make server to check up on us. It wasn’t that busy when we came in, so we were slightly concerned why he kept talking so long to take care of us. He took maybe 20-30 minutes each time to check up on us. Read more Amazing!!

We really enjoyed the food. Having a band play the oldies was an added bonus. We’d definitely go back again.  Service was amazing. Food was very delicious but room for improvement. Ambience and vibe was positive.  Wow. This is must stop when visiting Old Town, especially on Mondays, when the original Lobster Bucket is discounted by $10. The food is so good and there is so much of it, you will definitely ask for a box to take home your leftovers. Lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, corn, salad, rice, beans, tortillas with butter, chips with a variety of salsas. All delicious! Read more We always pick this restaurant when we pick up a guest at the airport because it's close, has good food and takes reservations.  Having dined on one of their ""bucket"" meals many times, we were a bit disappointed in the flavors.  The lobster, shrimp, beef and chicken simply did not have the great tastes as in the past.  Do they have a new head chef who changed the seasoning?  The crispy calamari was excellent.  Service was a bit uneven.  Not a place for quiet conversation - ever.  The Friday night band was quite enjoyable. Read more Baja style lobster is the best.  Need a better wine selection but the Margaritas are very good. We will be back.  We had a fantastic time at mother’s 87th Birthday! Sabrina was just the best ever! She was fun, attentive & professional…. Thank you for making our event special!  We had a good time. Food and ambiance we great. Only parking is the valet service at $7. But much better than hunting around for parking so didn't mind paying for the charge. Had reservation so the wait was not long at all. Read more Nice experience overall.  Food was perfectly prepared, but nothing fancy.  Solid place to grub out.  Lobster was impressively cooked to perfection.  Salsa bar was nice touch, but at least one batch was showing a bit of fermentation bite.  Everyone in our party loved their dinner.  Tacos got a solid thumbs up from the kids.  Music covered a range of genres, but grounded in 70's classic rock.  Good place for families, but not really date night spot.  Recommended. Read more Visited Rockin Baja with a friend for her birthday around 7 on a Saturday. We were seated right away despite reservations being 30 min from then, which I thought was really sweet of the hostess. We were seated outside where there was a live band which was awesome. The ambiance was great. We were given chips but the salsa was buffet style. Not sure how I feel about the Buffett style salsa and touching all those spoons touched by alll the other guests. The salsa was really good. The seafood enchilada was not good. At all. Super greasy and the tortillas were really tough. Our waiter was great.

Read more Beautiful restaurant with amazing view of the marina. Staff were courteous and welcoming. Our selections were amazing. Would return if ever back in San Diego.  Outstanding experience. The food was delicious and presented beautifully. Our server was by far the best server I have had at an upscale restaurant in a very long time. He was personable, made great suggestions, was prompt in following up with us and very friendly. He gets 10 stars all on his own.   Our chef that evening clearly is talented.

It was perfectly cooked and delicious. It was served with potatoes, spinach, asparagus,tomatoes and a delicious sauce. I highly recommend it.  Ordered the Canoe appetizer for 3 which was delicious and served promptly. After that we waited over 2 hours for the entrees to arrive. Our sever, Brooke, did her very best to accommodate us and was constantly apologizing for the situation which wasn’t her fault. Once served, all meals (short rib, filet mignon and tuna) were delicious. We feel that the kitchen back up should have resulted in a manager visiting our table. This is not an inexpensive restaurant. Read more Wonderful food and staff experience. The canoe appetizer plate was excellent.  The food was great when we finally got it.  There was definitely an issue in the kitchen as several tables around us experienced the same delays.  Everything was fine except the food took forever to come out! Maybe the longest I’ve ever waited for food. We also had to wait at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes to get greeted. Then she showed up and didn’t really greet us anyways. Just stood there and stared at us awkwardly. Read more Read more Great dining experience. Our waiter was engaging and friendly and good was excellent  Customer service was absolutely top-tier. I can give them more stars. I could thank you so much for the great experience.  The ambiance is nice unfortunately the rest of our experience was poor, the starter was nice. Our server was very good or apologetic about the mistake we received no apologies for the poor service and over-priced food. We have been to other Roy's and the service has fallen the menu hasn't changed with the times. We noticed other people sending back food who had been apologized to but, no us. I don't like writing poor reviews but, I do believe sometimes things need to be said. Please fix this over we will not be returning.

Concerned lifetime customer. Read more Our server was wonderful and made our anniversary celebration wonderful  Our service timeliness was below average which is not normal for higher priced restaurants.  In deference to Roy's, they may have been short a couple servers the night we were there.  We allowed an hour and forty five minutes to eat before a concert at The Shell.  We had to cancel our dessert order to get to the concert on time.  We ordered one salad, two entrees and as mentioned dessert, which we had to forego.

The wahoo special was wonderful, and drinks were well balanced. Will be back!  We had a wonderful time at Roy’s San Diego Waterfront. Everything was delicious and our server was fantastic. The only issue we had was a group that was getting ready to leave when we got there, they were complaining and making a big fuss over nothing to the manager. They were obnoxious and we felt awful for the servers, manager and hostess. After they left, we spoke to some of the other tables and they said that behavior had been going on for hours and it was appalling. Luckily, we had a great experience after the group left. We had absolutely amazing service and the food was delicious. Read more Food was fantastic, location very picturesque, great experience  Love the food, service and view, but the indoor seating was way too warm; made eating uncomfortable.

My fish was overcooked, but we had a concert and did not have time to send it back. We asked for a window seat, which was open, and she said it was for a reservation, which I also had one. No one ever showed while we were there. It took quite some time for our drinks to arrive, the food came 1st.  I don't normally post, because I believe you contact the restaurant directly.

Would love to go back someday.  We walked in excited for our anniversary dinner and realized we didn't need reservations at all. That should have been our first clue. Only two other tables were occupied at the time. Our hostess and server were exceptionally pleasant and welcoming. Everything went downhill from there. Our table was unstable, the menu items were limited, and our choice of braised short ribs was very disappointing. My wife's portion was 50% fat, and it all tasted like pot roast, which I would never choose in a restaurant. The strawberry lemonade tasted like a store-bought powder mix and the mashed potatoes had the consistency of instant potatoes. The ""best"" part was the little mini mixed vegetables, if you could overlook the bits of stem still attached. Maybe that's a posh thing, but unappetizing to us.
At least our server, Heather, apologized profusely and offered to speak to her manager. She came back and asked if we'd like another serving and we just asked for our check. Graciously they comp'd my wife's meal and offered a dessert to go. Once again, we just wanted to leave. We tipped Heather in cash and left. The best part of the meal was discovering an ice cream shop down the street and an Italian restaurant that was abuzz with patrons.

Won’t be going back. Read more Please don’t tell anyone else about this gem of a restaurant  My wife and I booked a table for Sunday brunch to celebrate our anniversary. We started with cocktails: I enjoyed The Shores margarita, which was made with some interesting adds such as prickly pear. My wife enjoyed her Mai Tai. The food was excellent: She had steak and eggs, and I had the Bananas Foster French toast:.4 large triangles of challah were topped with a mound of fresh fruit including raspberries, blueberries, and of course, bananas. Some syrup was already on the French toast, but it was augmented by a ramekin of a caramel-maple syrup. That proved perfect for dipping the 3 sausages that I ordered on the side. Later, my wife ordered a side of wheat toast; potatoes came with the steak and eggs, but no bread, which I found odd. It took a long time to get the toast, the only service issue we had at this lovely venue.

The view here is fabulous, with the ocean waves in the background and the boardwalk and Adirondack chair sitters in the foreground. My wife is disabled and uses a walker, so we were grateful to find a ramp at the front of the hotel, although we had to ask directions to the restaurant upon approaching the lobby.

Thank you the Shores!  What an amazing view from the restaurant and bar! I sat at the bar and David and Jessie (?) took great care of me. David immediately gave me water and welcomed me. I ordered the avocado toast with salmon and it was delicious and beautifully presented. I tried a new drink on the menu (something with vodka, yuzu and cinnamon). David told me it's a new one he suggested and he asked what I thought. It was crisp and refreshing and the flavors were perfectly put together.

David was busy and yet he kept smiling and seemed to be enjoying his time with the customers.

I will definitely be back.

The appetizer we ordered was too spicy and wasn’t supposed to be so had a couple bites and they took it off the bill. The Kung Po chicken was also way too spicy , not mildly either. Service was okay we had to ask 2x to credit for the app we didn’t eat, though Read more They were very accommodating for a group.  Food was great, and the portions were plentiful.

Our server was really good. Save the experience food was OK if something was left out in the spicy eggplant, it tasted very bland and a little bitter. We were not too fond of the new dipping sauce for the lettuce wraps with everybody around Us had the same complaint. The girl running expo did bring us the trio sauce.￼ Read more Exelente food and service  drinks were good , food was faste  Excellent service and fantastic food. We celebrated my birthday and the sparkle ring candle is impressive!  Joined a friend for lunch at P. F. Chang's at Fashion Valley. Devin was our super attentive server, he did his best to keep up with us, we're so crazy. We stuck to waters and I had a glass of freshly brewed Mango Iced Tea as we started our orders. 

For a lunch menu add-on, my friend picked the Hand-Folded Crab Wontons, wonton wrappers filled with creamy crab, bell pepper, green onion and fried, served with a spicy plum sauce. I went for a full on appetizer, the Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps minced chicken seasoned with garlic, scallion, sesame oil, with leaves of lettuce for wrapping/stuffing and their signature dipping sauce made of soy sauce, rice vinegar, chile carlic sauce, hot mustard paste chili oil and green onions, so good. .

From the “Lunch Favorites” a special midday menu of individually portioned lunch entrées, she chose the Mongolian Beef Bowl with sweet soy glaze, garlic, and green onion over brown rice and I chose the Orange Chicken Bowl, lightly battered chicken with sweet citrus chili sauce and garnished with fresh orange slices over fried rice.

All so delicious and nice to sit down for a meal instead of take out though it's all outstanding. Read more Read more We learned they have changed recipes & taken many vegetarian items off menu. My favorite dish was much spicier. Also my Open Table reservation was not received by restaurant.  Overall the experience and food was average. Nothing phenomenal or exceptional. I will say, the portions were quite large which is good to know in advance as we ordered way too much food and have left overs we will most likely not eat. I think this restaurant could improve by adding more flavor to the food - it was a bit bland. We ordered Edemame (can’t go wrong with that), shrimp dumplings (the best item we ate), Cesar salad, sushi roll with tempura, pad Thai (not good), and the Buddhas feast (least favorite). The manager stopped by spontaneously towards the end of our meal and gave us a free appetizer for next time which was very kind. I appreciate the efforts.

Service was good too, second time coming here! Only difference is last time we came for my nieces birthday they gave her a birthday dessert.

Very quiet for mid day lunch - I’d recommend for a great spot to eat downtown.  Excellent, set in well restored boutique hotel with large fun dining space - worthwhile just to enjoy the setting. Food was well prepared and good, but for me it needed more spice  My recent anniversary dinner at Provisional Kitchen at the Pendry was truly memorable. We were delighted with a cozy booth, thoughtfully positioned away from exits, and appreciated the spacious layout between tables, which provided a sense of privacy. The high ceiling and exquisite decor further enhanced the elegant atmosphere.

We opted for the five-course meal, and each dish was a delight, with standout favorites being the corn sauce pasta and the beef. Our waitress was attentive and personable, checking in after each course to ensure we were satisfied and to address any needs. The chef personally visited our table, which was a lovely touch, and presented us with special chocolates to celebrate our anniversary. The manager also stopped by to greet us, adding a personal touch to our experience.

Our experience for brunch was PHENOMENAL!
We both saw the five-course tasting option at the top of the menu and didn't look any further. We told our server, Christian, that we wanted to be completely surprised so didn't ask what any of the courses were.

Best breakfast in San Diego  Read more The best garlic bread starter, and pappardelle bolognaise ever! Plus Sai was a greater server.  Beautiful restaurant. Very attentive and friendly staff. Food could use very execution in general, so for that reason I think it’s overpriced. Huge potential.  We’ve eaten meals here 4-5 times over several years, we tend to go to brunch. Wednesday night we decided to go for pre-concert meal.
The place was nearly empty when we arrived but it took 30 minutes to get a drink served.
Waiter was unattentive throughout service, both meals were heavily over salted (and we like salt)!
We told the waiter and he took it upon himself to speak with the manager who comped one of the meals which was appreciated.
Overall Provisional is cool restaurant but through multiple experiences the wait staff and service is unusually slow, food is sometimes good but overall this place is very inconsistent. Such a bummer! Read more The staff and food was delicious!  In town for a business conference and we got our food in a very timely manner.

Excellent special occasion venue when you’re looking for a step above.

This is not a restaurant for those who mine noise, but we had set up in the bar area and that certainly was better. The beef Wellington, which had been suggested by the chef himself was superb Beth my other three companions.
The chef had introduced himself and indicated that he was taking the evening off, and I hesitate to mention anything other than compliments for such a wonderful place. However, I decided to try the chicken dish - like a chicken marsala - and unfortunately, my chicken was overcooked.
Because it was my husband’s birthday I did not say anything and only suggest that perhaps it’s better to come on a night when the chef is cooking 🍳

Once our order went in, everything, appetizers and entrees all came out at once super quick.  The food was not bad.  Kids loved the wings.  The hangar steak was quality meat but lacked seasoning.  The jalapeno butter sauce didn't cut it and the sautéed kale salad was super bland.  Overall, they used quality products but the cuisine was uninspired.  For the price tag, the food should be amazing.  Not planning on returning. Read more Could there be a more beautiful venue than the Coastal Golf Course at Torrey Pines? Food,Service,value exceptional!  Very good hamburger and onion rings.  Lovely setting.  Friendly service.  Great service. Food was good. Smaller menu. I remember having more food options on the menu. But a first class place.  Great service and food. I have had blonde server Lisa? on several occasions and she is so thoughtful and informative. I have food allergies and she goes the extra mile to make sure my food is made correctly.
I have been here for great dinners/lunches many times but this time when I went into the restrooms on the lower level by The Grill - it overwhelming smells like sewage. I don't know what was going on but it was awful. Hopefully this issue is getting resolved.
Otherwise great experience! Read more Great place with excellent service and the food was delicious!  The quantity of food is unreal but I’ll take quality over quantity every time & this is where The Grill didn’t live up to par.
The calamari was very good and enough for four, and there were only two in our party.
My entree was decent but lack flavor & my wife hanger steak was in bland and not worth the price.

Fantastic dinner with wonderful service.  Mario is a gem!  Thank you for an amazing night.  Quaint place, nice service, good menu.  Food was generally good but the portions are way too small for the price.  My only complaint. 😞  One of the best Italian restaurants in San Diego. And located in the very walkable and friendly neighborhood of barrio Logan. We were there the week they opened and the quality and creativity of their meals have only increased. Everyone that works there is so friendly and genuinely excited to share their food with you. And quick with an amazing recommendation. I cannot wait to see where they go from here. Read more There were four of us.  We ordered an antipasto board for the table. I suppose we didn’t read the description well enough. It was simply a plate full of Italian cured meats. There were four olives, and four small pieces of cheese, and way more than we could possibly eat as an appetizer. We also ordered the stuffed fried squash blossoms, which were the best culinary experience of the evening. It took a long time to get the attention of the waiter to order our entrées. Three of four thought entre was just ok. The person who ordered the pasta with Bolognese was happy. I had the special which was spicy red sauce on a pasta with shrimp and a head on Langostino. The waiter or the kitchen confused my order and they brought me the wrong dish. They offered to correct it “quickly,” but my dish came out just as my table mates were finishing theirs. They sat and waited while I ate my entrée. The shrimp was hard to find, the Langostino was very overcooked and poorly cleaned. The spicy sauce was lackluster. The restaurant had been highly recommended by a friend who typically makes excellent recommendations, so perhaps it was a bad night. But all in all I was pretty disappointed.

My daughter had the lasagna and the entire top was inedible and burnt. The dishes were very small in portion size. The service was non existent and we felt like the server was annoyed. The food runner slammed our plates on the table when he delivered them. I won't be back. Read more Recently heard good comments so we tried it this evening as part of our 25th anniversary.

Outside wasn’t much better as they have a very indoor outdoor environment. The food was OK, service was average  but we will not go back. Whoever decided that blaring music is the way to go in a very small restaurant, should probably look for another career. Read more I like this place! Food and service are exceptional!  Only complaint is lack of gluten free options or guidance on menu to accommodate.  Amazing food and amazing ambience. Great service as well  Made a reservation for a meal, showed up on time, not crowded... The waiter finally arrived 10 minutes after being seated and his only words were, ""Want drinks?""  We ordered, nothing came... Another server came over and we told her drinks had been ordered, another 10-15 minutes and drink arrived.  We did take note of the waiter on his phone in the kitchen nook... No waiter, no order, we finally all got up and I asked for a manger... He offered a gift card but I'd never eat there again so I declined it.  

Poorly managed, the waiter should have been fired on the spot.  What a fall from glory.  Don't waste your time. Read more Our server seemed to disappear once she took our order, never to be seen again. Luckily, plenty of support staff could take care of us. While the salmon was delicious, the plating seemed sparse—salmon, some sliced cucumbers, and avocado—that's it. The restaurant was loud and very drafty, so be sure to bring a sweater or layers. Read more Overall, decent. Some food was very good while some was fair to poor. Noise level was high...the sound system was set where the bass was so high it was deafening and made conversation difficult. Read more We just love this place.

The Hensleys Read more Always a lovely time, but we had a server who was training and a few things were overlooked.

Read more Read more 10/10 I loved it and am just filling out the text requirements  The atmosphere and service was unmatched! The food was super tasty but portions are smaller and it wasn’t the strongest of the other restaurant attributes. However, I would definitely go again and try more from the menu! Read more A gem of a place! Food, drinks, vibe, were all excellent. A terrific date nite spot as well.  Been here several times and the food is outstanding…. love the ambience, too.  Overall, excellent!  Great service. Didn’t rush us. Waitress made great suggestions.  Hadn’t been there in a while, so the Caesar salad was as good as ever but we were shocked at the $18 charge to add salmon to the salad.  We were there to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends. We had a wonderful evening. Food was amazing and so were the cocktails.  The food was excellent. We had the Brussels Sprouts and the Scallops and both were excellent. And, the butterscotch Pudding is a MUST try - so yummy!
Our service was not good.  Our waiter was snooty and not very attentive. The bussing was terrible.  We had to actually ask twice for our dinner dishes to be removed from the table.  For me, a big part of the dining experience is the service so it was disappointing. It's also a very noisy restaurant inside so we sat outside which wasn't great since we had a view of the parking lot and bright lights from cars in our eyes. Read more Not your location for catching up with friends , very loud and open , but beautiful and you “ want “ to be there , be seen… not inexpensive for food nor drinks , service was fair. Just saying …  This was pretty the worst service we had in years. 20 minutes waiting to take beverage order, non interested waiter, the food was nothing special. We were 3 had a special occasion, he asked for order of two and had to remind to ask for the third person. Beverages (coffee, etc) came after breakfast, not before and we have to remind them when the food was brought.
Didn’t asked if we wanted something else, he just brought the check. The place was not full to be in a rush, seems the restaurant is more interested in larger groups than small which we saw they received better attention.
There are much better places in SD don’t waste your time or money Read more Read more We always love The Waverly!
We especially loved our waitress! Wish we could remember her name.  First time going and having cold Barratta donuts. Won't hold it against them but we were bummed.  This is one of the nicest places in the area to sit and have a happy hour drink, which is all we’ve done until now. But we heard the food was good (the happy hour fries are outstanding) so we went for dinner. The food was really tasty, all of us very much enjoyed what we ordered. The scallops were very pricey at $46 for 3 scallops, but they were cooked to perfection. We’ll definitely be back (and I’ll probably have the pork chop). Read more Waverly is pleasant, airy, and tropical. Our guest hadn’t been there before and thought it felt a little like Hawaii, with the open doors on all sides, and ferns inside and palm trees outside. It’s in a popular. funky neighborhood center, with lots of action outside in the courtyard and walkway, with families, kids, dogs, and people parading by, often with pizzas to go from a nearby shop. 

We shared the Gioia Burrata Donuts, $19, five somewhat bland round balls of bread (donut holes?) topped with prosciutto and in a basil and tomato fondue. 

The duck meatball, $20, is tasty and can work as a main dish for those with lighter appetites. Our guest enjoyed the large cut of moist and tasty salmon, $36, although she said it had a little bit of a hard crust. She liked the side of cucumbers, avocado, and tomato. 

I don’t recommend the scallops, $46 — three lonely scallops prepared beurre blanc, topped with trout roe and in a bowl, with leeks, potato, and spinach. Service was sketchy. Good at first, with water service, opening our bottle of wine (Corkage fee, $25), and bringing the wine glasses. After that, we had to ask for water several times and pour our own wine. We’ve had better dinners here and will probably return when the menu changes. Read more We were there for brunch and the music was very loud and had a heavy club music beat. It was difficult to relax and have a conversation.  Food and service terrific.  Wine very good but we thought the list was a bit overpriced.
Noise level high so tough to have a conversation but it didn't seem to bother most people. Read more Wow. Just wow. First time here - fantastic. Sat outside on a gorgeous summer night. Started off with a Kona Old Fashioned - tremendous and perfectly blended: Pickled potatoes with crème fraiche - to die for. The waiter tried to clear if before we got all the crème and I threatened to stick a fork in his hand (jk!). Salmon was lovely, pork chop spicy and perfectly seasoned. Wine list short-ish but good variety - the Gruner Veltliner was excellent. Finally the butterscotch dessert - holy cow. So good. Our server Miles did a great job. We will be back!  Don’t hesitate to check this place out. Read more It was a great experience for us. We had a great meal in a friendly atmosphere.  The food was not as good as we had on prior visits. A little bland. The Arnold Palmer was diluted. 
Not sure if it’s shrinkflatiin. We ordered the Baja style bowl, this needs some salsa Fresca and lemon or lime. The Caesar salad was typical. Read more Amazing food! We had a nice variety and shared plates. Loved the Matcha  drink. Service was outstanding everyone really  worked together.

Service was a bit slow as they were really busy, but it our server was pleasant.  The ""Bloody Bull"" was really good as were the crab stuffed mushrooms and zucchini.  We were there for probably 1.5 hours and the only real comment was that we were surprised at the really loud and foul language at the bar (we sat at a high top near the bar).  The group of guys there were doing lots of shots and were pretty hammered - which is none of our business.  It was when the incessant ""f-bombs"" were getting dropped constantly with other crude language that it made us pause a bit for when we would next visit or if we would take guests with us.  The establishment is obviously doing well and don't necessarily need our business, but just wanted to share some feedback. Read more I have been enjoying Bully’s since 1969! Although the prices have certainly changed over the years, I still consider it a good value for what you get!

Our waitress was nice.. the prime rib had good flavor, but was chewy for the $50 price tag. The creamy horseradish was very thin and runny and the baked potato was ok but overcooked and our dessert Creme brûlée was underwhelming and it was overpriced as well.

Unfortunately, our waitress came back a few minutes later to let me know the kitchen was out of the short rib entree and recommended the short rib pasta instead. I said okay. It was so unexpectedly bland. For a dish that features horseradish and arugula, there was no bite and no peppery flavor. I laughed that my 5 year old would have loved it. The three of us who got the short rib pasta all thought it could have been better. The people who got pizzas said they were great. Moving on. We then got a variety of desserts, including the butter cake, the olive oil cake, and the tiramisu. The waitress highly recommended the butter cake. It was another miss. The tiramisu was average. The olive oil cake was outstanding. I also had the house made raspberry limoncello, which was great. Overall, everything was so so.

Overall the experience was very good and the ambiance was magnificent.  We were really disappointed. We had heard so many good things about Oceana Coastal Kitchen, and were looking forward to our dinner. 

Service was slow, and not very informative or welcoming. We ordered an appetizer that, when it came out, was nothing at all as it was described on the menu. We were told that it was indeed what we ordered but when we pointed out it was missing a key ingredient that was clearly stated on the menu, we were told it was there. When we sent it back, it came with the ingredient but again - not as described. We sent it back and asked it be taken off our bill.

We were sat on time by the manager and greeted by our server. Our server took our drink order and our choices from the menu. My drink was brought in about five minutes. And then we sat for 25 minutes without anyone in the restaurant speaking to us. The table next to us sat after I had received my drinks received their starters by a different waiter. When they received their second course, I tapped their waiter on the shoulder and asked if there had been some emergency with our server since we had not yet received our starters. He went and got the manager who came and introduced himself and asked if there was any problems. I told him that we had been sat for 30 minutes and had not yet received our soup.  I received a sassy answer from him where he told me this was the first he had heard about it. I asked how long a starter should take, and instead of answering, he gave me a retort about how I have to understand that he didn’t know that there was any problem , when I continued to ask who he was, if he was actually the manager, and where our soup was, his response was that he could either stand here talking with me or get my soup, which did I want?
Instead of our server, bringing the soup, the Manager returned about seven minutes later with our soup, which should have been premade in a large vat in the back. As he sat down the soup I looked at him and said I just want to understand that I’m not getting an apology from you. at that point he said “I would’ve given you an apology but you didn’t let me speak.” And that I “had to understand and give him an opportunity.” When I’m paying $150 for dinner I don’t feel that I have to give a restaurant the opportunity to explain such poor service.

Will be back again for brunch  our server was incredibly forgetful, we had to wait 10 minutes for a hostess to seat us, once we were seated our server told us to our faces she forgot about us. Once we ordered it took over an hour to get our food and our waters were not refilled ONCE. we also had to leave our table to go search for our server so we could leave. And there was cocaine left in the bathroom on top of the toilet paper holder Read more They had kitchen issues so bar food was almost 45 minutes coming out.  When we got it the chicken fingers consisted of two normal sized one and one teeny tiny one.  Fries were cold. Not good. Service was good. Read more Waiter was awesome! Nice spot to hang out. The food was okay... The ambiance & people make up for it  Great food and great service! I had the fish and chips which was perfectly cooked. My husband had the bacon onion jam burger and his response was ""this is the best burger I've ever had"". We also had the bacon wrapped jalapeños ...yummy! Read more Read more Went on a Friday and it was empty. A salad wrapped took over an hour to get. All the other food came out. I hate to leave this.  The staff is great at Gossip Grill.  I took my granddaughter and my daughter last week.  The food we had (burgers and wings) were fine.  A wonderful place filled with wonderful people! If you’re looking for a pickup to your mood come out here.  My server, Aubrey, was so kind and I felt so taken care of! If you get a chance to have her, she’s amazing! Very welcoming and takes great care of you!  The ambiance was good. We were there for an hour and the didn’t put our food in. We had somewhere to be, so we never ate. Getting a drink  took forever too. Wouldn’t recommend.  Not what I expected. Didn't match the pictures. More of a club vibe vs dining/cocktails.  Went for Saturday brunch … music was great and there was a Trivia Game going. Food was delicious and drinks were strong lol. Great time.. can’t wait to go again.  Last time I visited, everything was good. The food especially. This past experience was disappointing. The food took too long. We made reservations and we were still seated inside in a dark space. The food arrived cold. The service seemed distant. I don’t know why it was so bad, I can only attribute it to it being Easter. Definitely disappointed. I will try this place again on a quieter day. I wouldn’t recommend it on a holiday. It was like night and day in difference of quality and service. Read more Honestly this place is only good if you’re intoxicated. The inside looks like a dark cave. So not inviting and the food was bland. I had to use Salt. I would’ve rather had eaten at Denny’s. That’s what the food is compared to. However my server was AWESOME! He just works at the wrong place. NEVER again. Read more My fiancé and I decided to go to San Diego to celebrate our anniversary. Came across this place on YELP and decided to check it out. We made reservations and we headed there to enjoy a nice dinner. To our surprise, this was nothing but a run-down bar. The place was a bit dirty and definitely not a place to celebrate an anniversary. We order some bar food, which is what they offered. Honestly when it comes to the food, it felt as if the food it's coming from the freezer straight to the microwave. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Park in Grand Hyatt's garage for 3 hours of complimentary self-parking with validation.","Read more Booked a table indoors, expected to sit at the area with windows and a harbor view. Got a table behind in a ""dining room"". Dark, no windows and loud. As we sat down another party came and was very noisy at the neighbor table. We could hardly talk to each other at our table . There were lots of other tables in the area, but they were given the table beside us.
Food tasted good, but small portion and a high price for what it was. Food came fast and was well cooked and balanced taste.
Recommendation of wine was not good, and that we told  the waiter, who asked if we wanted another wine. But waiter was not really interested in why we didn't like the wine. Not a lot of customers, but still it felt like the staff was running around which gave me a feeling of rush.

It felt more like a fish and chip shop than a proper restaurant as it was noisy and staff running around shuffling out food, even as it was not many guests Read more Our server, Javier, was delightful and helpful when choosing our dinners.  The fish and chips was the best we had ever tasted, as was the seafood chowder.  The lava cake, though highly recommended was a bit disappointing as it was not sufficiently warm to allow the “lava” to actually flow.  The gelato on top was delicious.  The views are amazing. Read more The food was terrible.  The seafood towel's lobsters were not fresh, and the paella's lobsters were over cooked.  The lobsters were so not fresh, that there's a yellow color on the end of tails, and it was very hard.  I also found a hair inside the paella. Never go back there again. Read more Gorgeous Location right on the harbor. The food was amazing!  The food was good but entrees were extremely expensive!  Service was wonderful, food was just ok for the price.  Fantastic food moderately priced and a brilliant and friendly staff.  Great place to eat and overlook the water. We all enjoyed are time spent  Our server Alex was excellent. Very attentive.Wonderful view of bay. Very noisy with many convention people. Didn’t matter, food was great!
And they brought water to our pug.
Highly recommend. Read more Juan was excellent server and has a great singing voice-sang Happy Birthday to my husband. Food was outstanding!  Read more Server was great! Ambience was lovely.

Crab cakes, lobster roll, fish and chips.
Will return to try the scallops and other dishes.
And tasty drinks 😋
Serviced by Rey Read more Food was amazing! King crab was out of this world and we ordered it warm as a main side. Even their butter was top tier. Their tomato and burrata salad was perfection and I loved the balsamic pearls- brilliant! The seafood bisque was so good. Everything we ordered was delicious and we devoured it! Excellent quality food with more than fair pricing, beautiful scenery and our server was wonderful. We are definitely coming back! Its a must if you stay at the Hyatt! Read more Food good, but overly expensive.  Service good. 
 Ambiance nice. Wouldn't go back due to pricing.  We had a lovely outdoor table overlooking the harbor. Very nice temperature outside and an outdoor umbrella to protect us from the sun. Excellent, tasty food and very polite and attentive server. On the expensive side, but we really enjoyed the experience. Read more We made a reservation and we were seated on time.

Will return!  Read more Nice restaurant on the marina, food and service good  Sally’s was a disappointment. We ordered the paella with no chorizo, they left the chorizo and removed the scallops. We informed our waiter and 30 minutes later he gave us a bowl of rice with chopped scallops. This was unacceptable, we should’ve be offered a remake instead of waiting that long for a few scallops. Read more We frequent here at lunch when walking on the harbor. The food and service is consistent and they allow dogs on the patio. They even have a full on pup menu.  We love Sally’s but last night was a bit disappointing. None of the food was the least bit hot. The server was apologetic and said we should have let them know but we didn’t have time to have everything remade (concert tix) and that seemed like such a waste of food. We’ll still go back and hope for the better experiences we’re used to. Read more Beautiful location but shrimp tacos were incredibly salty and overcooked. Buratta salad was good but tomatoes weren’t ripe so they were dry and not very flavorful. Sadly, not the quality we hoped for. Our server Jose was very kind and attentive. Read more The best thing about Sally's is the view.  That's about it.  The food was mediocre, and very expensive. A glass of wine was $20, and not special. We ordered two tiny crab cakes, small salads, and brussel sprouts.  And two glasses of wine.  The tab was close to $100.  Disappointing. Read more A reliable choice for dining along San Diego Bay!  Great atmosphere to be able to sit outside by the harbor. The food is really good and the place is dog friendly. It was nice they had food options for your pet.  The fish items we had weren’t very fresh. A lot of citrus used to mask old  fish.  We had a very nice experience eating outdoors. The food and service were excellent.

And its authentic style drew a loyal following of those in search of Sonoran grilled swordfish tacos, sizzling sirloin fajitas, and spicy rich chicken mole.

Over three decades, our signature friendly service and festive decor have made Miguel’s a San Diego tradition for locals and visitors alike. Our commitment to artisan cuisine has only grown stronger. That means handmade tortillas, fresh salsas, and colorful crispy chips made daily right in our kitchen. Of course, there’s our decadent, must-have jalapeño white sauce, occasionally referred to as white gold by regulars, and craved up and down the coast.

We had an incredible time at Miguel’s! The shrimp quesadilla was outstanding, and we also loved the salsa, queso, and guacamole—everything was fresh and flavorful. The tequila shots of Lalo were perfect and added to the great vibe. Our waiter, Emiliano, was super attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. His service really elevated the experience. Overall, we had an amazing evening and can’t wait to come back! Read more Excellent service. Ambience was nice. Food was ok to good. Had swordfish tacos. Fish was lukewarm but tasty. Beans and rice were a tad too salty for me. My wife had chopped salad with chicken. The salad was fresh but the chicken excessively dry.  Although this review is not 5 stars, I will be back to try other dishes. I’ve been here numerous times and it has always been very good Read more 100% AWESOME. Drinks were great, food was delicious and hand-made tortillas.. yummy.  It took a while for the waiter to great us. We were served chips really quick upon being sat by the chip guy. We were parched and really needed drinks. Finally much later the waiter came. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. The food came out incorrect. The waiter said something about his computer thing not adding my husbands meal. Had to wait even longer since the order was messed up. Overall not a great experience today Read more Beautiful evening for dinner on the water & this did not disappoint. Greeted immediately, seated a little early for our reservation & from the lemon lime margarita to the salsa & queso to dinner itself, all was great. Will surely be back on our next visit. Read more Able sit outside. Our female waistress was attentive, helpful selections  One of my favorite restaurants to take visitors to! Always great service and great food!!!  We had some friends visiting from out of town and we enjoyed a lovely dinner on the hottest day looking out over the bay - all of the service was fantastic  Unfortunately today was a very hot day and although the restaurant is by the water it seemed they didn’t have their AC on so it was hot and not a good breeze flowing through to help. Food was just ok but lacked flavor and our waiter didn’t check on us enough even though he was nice he was not attentive as much as he should have been. Read more Read more Great food and location. I was unlucky and received a slow server.  Never had A bad meal here at Miguel‘s. We eat there frequently as we live in the neighborhood. The food is fresh, authentic and tasty. It was also quite plentiful. My husband and I frequently share a fajitas platter. Highly recommend making a reservation on OpenTable as it’s quite busy all the time.
Natalie is an excellent server. Read more I decided to check out Miguel’s to celebrate a birthday. I had reserved a table in advance and changed my reservations 1 hour before my previously booked time. Once we got there they said I was 20 minutes late, but I informed them I had rebooked through the app. We didn’t get the seats we wanted and the host ended up giving our seats to the couple in front of us in line. Our server took forever to come to our table and only checked in on us once throughout the night. The foos was fair but not worth the price. A small incident happened while we were there and nobody came to assist us with urgency. Unfortunately I will not be coming back nor use open table to book. Read more My husband and I were visiting my GF and her BF. We went to celebrate my 70th birthday and it was a beyond FABULOUS experience. Not only did we get an excellent table with a sunset view but Mercedes was exceptional giving me a tiny saucer of mole, just like my mom used to make. The margaritas were fabulous and she was very attentive, waiting on us regularly but feeling like a friend or family at the same time.
Will definitely rave about the ambience, service, PLENTIFUL food, seating etc. The noise can be turned down a bit but we made it.
Oh and the baked ice cream was fabulous. Thank you. Read more The restaurant accommodated our seating requests, and once it got a bit chilly closed the breezeway doors. Very authentic food, great space to hold a conversation. Would recommend for celebrations, date night, or a family hangout. Read more This has been one of our favorite places. Although this experience was disappointing, we will return. Staff seemed confused and disorganized. Checked in on time for our reservation and was told it would be a 5 minute wait for an outside table, requested as it is too loud inside for my mother to hear. After about a 30 minute wait with my 81 year old mother and watching other similar parties that arrived later get seated, I checked back in. Apparently, they completely forgot about us. After being seated in an outside booth, the farthest from the bay front, our server was friendly and food was good. However, they forgot to provide napkins/utensils. When asked, we got napkins. Had to ask again to get utensils after our food arrived. Read more Great view, awesome food and incredible white sauce.  Delicious food and great service. Ambience very nice. Love being by the water.  We arrived about 20 minutes ahead of our reservation time and were asked to wait. I get it but I had to return to the desk to ask about being seated. There were no other waiting parties but a number of walk-ins asking to be put on the wait list. When we were seated, there were several empty tables and booths. It was very busy on the pier so I’m glad I made a reservation!
Everyone in our party enjoyed their food and beverages. However, those of us that ordered the Ultimate Margarita thought it was too sweet and tasted more orange juice flavored and needed more tequila! Chips, salsa, and cheese dip came right away but the drinks took some time. Our waiter, Eddie was personable and attentive! Overall, the group enjoyed our dining experience! Read more Excellent service and probably Miguel’s most beautiful restaurant. I would have given 5 stars all around if it were not for the fact that the 7 Mares soup did not include all of the seafood mentioned under the description on the menu, which was disappointing. Everything else was perfect, however, so we will definitely be returning. This place is beautiful and the location is absolutely perfect, especially if you have out of town guests! Read more Read more Food is great, and the margaritas are amazing.  The servers are attentive  We had the fajitas. Food standard was good. Restaurant is in a good location.  The food was good. The serving size was more than enough (we both brought food home). And the wait staff was prompt and courteous.
The view from the dining room was o.k. A seat in the middle of the room or on the deck would have been preferred, and even though we had a reservation, we would have had to wait 30 minutes for a table to open.
Parking along the embarcadero is non-existent, however Valet parking is available.
The noise (music and ambiance) was a little loud, over-bearing on our conversations.
It's a decent restaurant for ""tourists"" not necessarily ""locals."" Read more We really enjoy going to Miguel’s. This location is always a treat when down in San Diego. The view is one of the nicest. The service was good. I would have scored service higher had my son’s burrito been what he wanted. The server acted like he knew what he wanted but instead it was the complete opposite. We asked what was inside and he said lettuce, cheese, and meat. We were like great we want that and dry. We didn’t want any of the sauces since he doesn’t like them. Instead what we got was a dry burrito with all the sauces put inside instead.  Overall, it was a great experience. Read more Love their crunchy chips and cheesy dip!
My favorite part.  We took my adult son and his girlfriend to dinner here. Everyone loved their special margaritas [Mango with Chamoy, and Passion Fruit], as well as the raspberry mojito. Our server was Mariano and he was awesome. Very happy and helpful. The view and ambiance were great and the food was not crazy overpriced for what we received. 
I recommend this to both locals and tourists. Read more the food, service, and scenery was absolutely amazing. I’m definitely recommending this place to friends and family!  My family went there for a birthday party. Service was wonderful. I believe it was a little over priced. But I would go again.  I like this Miguel's location, the ambiance is beautiful. Right in the heart of the Harbor in downtown San Diego. We've enjoyed the view of the Harbor and how some of the maritime sail boats gets pretty close and gives you a fun glimpse of the boaters passing by. There's a lot to see, but most importantly are the food taste, the quality of the service and the attentiveness of the wait staff. Our reservation was after the lunch rush, so we were able to just take our time indulging our food, drinks, and the view. This is not my first time in this location, I've visited this place anytime we have out of town guests. Best place to take anyone who is visiting San Diego, and Miguel's Portside Pier is a place to take them.

The table wasn’t even set up I had to grab chairs and fix it. We sit down wait another 13 min and weren’t even looked at. A table next to us was being seated and before their butt even hit the chair their drink orders were being taken. 
We left immediately. This seems to be a reoccurring problem with us and we’re not sure why. We must have a sign on us that says “we don’t want food service” sad part is that we’re the type to tip more than half the bill if not 100% if the service is worth it. That being said we went to lazy dog and got immaculate service. Tipped $50 on a $100 bill. Thank you lazy dog and Dave and busters do better. Read more Our individual server was great! However, the front told us we did not have a reservation. Even when we showed her the text message, she said ""well we don't have a hostess until 5pm...its open seating,"" which would've been fine if we weren't a party of 12. We had trouble finding a table to accommodate us. Read more Honestly we left before they could even serve us. Took forever to get a seat and when we were sat, we weren’t served for 25 minutes before we left. Definitely not enough servers for the level of people that were there. Between the amount of time it took without anyone serving us, the amount of time it would have taken for us to get drinks and food… it was no longer worth it. On top of all this, I saw 3 or 4 other parties get served before us.

Had 2 reservation and was told 75% of party has to be there in order to get table. Didnt mind that. After some minutes my party is showing uo and than was told my table was given to a company that purchased the whole room.  Had to wait for them to figure something out. After almost an hour they gave us 1 of my reservation cus we was already fustrated and hungry. Got our table and had to wait another 20 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. But as soon as he did the rest of night went good thanks to him. Read more Cool place for meals and games.  Kids enjoyed the games.  A little too noisy.  Cost of food and game cards were a little pricey.  Never coming here again.  Made reservations with instructions well in advanced only to get yelled at by the hostess that our party is too big and they have to separate the servers…blah blah blah.  Not our problem.  Don’t tell me, a paying customer, how you should’ve taken care of this, your job!
Thankfully, our server, Christina, was on it and served the entire party of 50+.
Complained to the manager that the hostess was yelling at us and we were simply following her direction.  Did not appreciate her yelling at our boys (baseball team) aren’t sitting in the right place.  What is the point of making resevations?!?!.  The manager was pleasant but still had the hostess staring at our players and families complaining to fellow servers and hosts how we weren’t supposed to be sitting together.
We will never come here again.  Christina got a nice fat tip from our group for being so gracious and handling the whole situation. Read more Read more Amazing food and service! We will definitely be back!  Our server took great care of us, she was attentive and had great customer service. When we first arrived the hostesses seemed very on edge because they were busy due to the UFC fight. My first interaction with them was them saying that unfortunately they didn’t have a table where we could watch when I never made mention of wanting to. They then had us wait until the rest of our party arrived but once we asked them to sit us they then had to check if our table was ready but the main issue was their attitude. Read more The food was pretty good for the price. It is very loud due to the arcade being right next to the table. As long as you’re here to spend time playing games, it’s a great place with good service. It’s very difficult to carry a conversation here due to the noise. Read more food and service were great with zero issues. Will come back!  Food was ok but the prices were very high for the amount & quality that you get. The place was extremely noisy of course because it's filled with kids as to be expected. The service was excellent & the front desk employees were also helpful & very nice. Read more The dining area was so packed that you couldn’t even get out of your table because the table next to you was super close. The staff was not friendly at all. They were just do their job but not even a smile or anything. I don’t know if this is because it was the weekend but not sure we’re gonna come back again Read more As a family of 5 we spent $380 dollars on five meals and four 100credit playing cards.

My son lost his card and they were able to get a replacement right away. Food was great and also the service!  Read more It seems that waiters and waitresses have to do a lot of walking to get their task of serving accomplished. This would explain why we didn't get a second glass of iced tea, and when we were done it took 15 to 20 minutes for us to leave. We just want to get into your arcade too spend more money.  Let's think about the simple basics of what you are doing at your restaurants and gaming venues. Read more Staff was not helpful, did not take care of the table  The best part of this experience was the food. Tried a couple of new-to-me dishes and loved them. The Stacked Steak Bowl was definitely a winner in my book, and the Loded Barbacoa Fries were delicious. The noise level made it necessary to almost yell just to chat with my friend sitting right in front of me. I understand that the NBA Finals game was on, but this is the second time we’ve come here and the volume of the TVs was so loud we couldn’t hear ourselves talking. And no, it wasn’t the noise from the restaurant guests that was overpowering, it was the TVs.

I can get past that. What I can’t get past is the poor service we received on this visit.🤦🏽‍♂️ The hostess, though seemingly young, performed her duties at what I would consider “the bare minimum to keep the job”. Our waiter (not young) seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with everything because he barely checked on us, only brought by refills AFTER most of our meal was gone, and was extremely dismissive of us when we were paying our check.

Had this been my first time here, I may have simply assumed this was just the way things were. But we had been here just 5 days ago with a different server (Alyssa, she’s a total sweetheart and an excellent server🤩), and we received quite a different experience. Though the noise may have been still really loud, at least Alyssa made the rest of our visit worth it - and she was VERY busy that night!

We will be returning, I’m sure, because honestly it’s hard to beat the price. But we’ll definitely be requesting a different server on our next visit. Read more The waiter made it clear that he had two other large parties and could not attend to us. Refused to allow us to do 3 separate checks. The food was incorrect. Overall bad service.  Our table was ready and seated at 215. Our table and chairs were dirty. Food and trash on floor at our table and around.  Many emptied tables with dirty plates and not cleared all around us. Took until 2:40 to even get drink order. That was wrong but corrected. Then 2 kids plates came out lile 10/15 minutes before drinks and other dishes. My bacon burger was gross and had super cold bacon jam that made it cold. Food was not tasty. Read more overall we had a good time but we began bad when even tho I had a reservation, I had to wait & the excuse was that there were too many walk ins. So why even make a reservation? 
We had to wait about an extra 20min, not bad, before they sat us. The waiter took a while to get our drinks & then only brought half of the tables drinks & until we said something brought the rest. The food was also brought at separate times, a bit frustrating. This was about my 3rd time dining here, I usually come to just play but the food was good tasting & the rest of the night was good. Read more Quality of food is really bad. We ordered a Margherita pizza and the baby cherry tomatoes were still whole and ice cold. We also ordered dry rub Cajun boneless wings and it was nothing like Cajun. A manager walked over and we told him about both items. He claimed that the tomatoes were a garnish on the pizza and that’s why it’s ice cold and whole. He also claimed that the dry rub Cajun is actually a sauce and that the menu is wrong. He walked away after. Worse food / service. A lot of the games were glitchy as well after when we went to go play. Lost some money because it scanned our card but never authorized the game play. Read more Great experience! Perfect to celebrate 8th grade promotion. Fast service. Friendly staff. Kids loved it.  Unpleasantly loud but the service was quick and friendly.

We took a couple of friends for restaurant week.  The prime rib was excellent.  It was a generous cut and all the sides were perfect.  We all had a great time and agreed the food was great.

The chowder and mahi mahi were my favorites but all dishes were great.  Our server was fun and attentive.  It was a Monday night so place was not loud or busy which was nice.  They were all very welcoming of our 2 year old daughter too!  Will def return! Read more The overall experience is ok. The food was ok, the ceviche being dry and bland and everything being not bad  Our first time and we love it! Annie is the best!

I had the Maine Lobster (again) perfectly cooked, the Short Ribs were juicy, and the fish and chip overflowed with fish.   

Try it you will not be disappointed! Read more Great little neighborhood spot. Yummy prime rib and excellent service.  Service was amazing; great staff!

Cocktails were great.
Decor and general ambience very pleasant.
This was our first visit, and we look forward to coming back. Read more Another excellent lobster dinner!  We’ve enjoy this special several times this summer. Sad to be leaving San Diego, but we’ll be back soon.

Kudos to Nick for always making us feel welcome and to Annie for her excellent service and for pacing our meal just the way we like it! Read more Our reservations were at 6pm, and eating inside, we found it quite noisy.  In fact, it was so noisy that we could barely hear each other.  Next time we will go much earlier.

We had the  Maine lobster, which was hard shell.  It is a small one- maybe one pound, but good. The vegetables I ordered as a side were cooked to perfection - not over cooked.  It came with rice, also very good.

Bread is extra, and cost $7.   I had a Russian River Chardonnay, which was wonderful.  For desert, my husband had a root beer float, a favorite desert which is hard to find in restaurants.

We were there for the lobster special on Thursdays.  Next time we will try out the regular menu. Read more Always a great experience here! Love the ambience and the workers are always friendly. Look forward to fun times here in the future  Lobster needs to be cracked when requested - not told ""we don't do that"" -  but.......sometimes can get the kitchen staff
to do it.   Then provide a hammer or better tools.  Read more The artichoke tacos are to die for. I liked how I was never pressured to get in and out quickly. Although there were a few open tables at the time. Overall, I would go back just for the artichoke tacos and the large portion desserts. Read more Fantastic service! Tasty menu! Great specials! Absolutely love this restaurant!!!  We’ve eaten here many times over the past few years, but last night’s dinner was way below par. We each ordered one of the specials and both were dry and uninteresting. Awful, actually. Not sure we’ll go back. Read more Very great vibe going in here! Bottomless for $10 was great. The food was okay. My friend got french toast and it was very bland.  Visited Harley Gray last night with our friends - we all live downtown and decided to head up to Mission Hills for a little dinner.  It was delicious!  We all had something different - the chicken pesto pasta, short ribs and mashed potatoes, shrimp scampi with pasta and the special, halibut with risotto.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  We then shared two desserts, the apple cobbler and the mud pie - both equally yummy! Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable - so sorry I don't recall her name.  We also enjoyed some cocktails and wine!  We agreed that the pricing was very reasonable and we will definitely return again! Read more Service and dinner were  awesome.   Will return soon  Our Prime Rib was delicious.  Cocktail a little skimpy. Our server was terrific.  The food was great, the special was amazing.  Service was top notch.

Read more It was OK- definitely a good value for lobster night!!   Not many people. Server was great! Alcoholic drinks- very weak! Lobster served with only rice.

We had a great view and stayed for almost two hours!  Both the hotel and restaurant appear quiet and hanging on by a thread.  Very limited menu, no desserts!  One very capable woman was hostess and server.  However, including us, there were only four tables occupied. Read more I was there with a group of 5 for Restaurant Week. Unfortunately we were seated at a table right next to a “private” group area with only a filmy curtain separating us. As that party ramped up, we could not hear one another at all, basically had to lip-read. I don’t think the party was overly rowdy, but the physical set up was terrible for noise. We love the location and have been there many times under different ownership. Food/service was excellent and we may try again but be very specific about seating! Read more Sea and Sky is a great experience. The food was excellence and had a great theme and story. My wife ordered the restaurant week deal which was an appetizer, salmon, and Chocolate mousse. It was a great dish. My son ordered the Burger and fries.  We ordered the oysters as our appetizer and Dennis our server gave us a wonderful description and story about the oysters theme. The oysters were served with a delicious green pesto sauce and a white bubbly foam. Dennis said the chef wanted to recreate the crashing waves on the shore Which it did for me. As I was instantly transported to the sea shore (which I also had a wonder view of) I could only think how infinitely creative a dish that was.  I then ordered the Grilled red snapper for which Dennis described as ""imagine cooking your red snapper over a camp fire on the shore."" As I received my dish I couldn't help but be transported to the sea again. I was so inspired that I started eating my grilled snapper with my hands. The stories defiantly enhanced the theme of the dishes to be sure. 
    However, Be Prepare to pay full retail. Sea and sky is not a bad value for an Upscale/casual dining experience but it does cost a little more than some of my other C/U restaurants I frequent . In fact they didn't want to leave a dime on the table. My wife and I ordered regular coffee after our two drinks and they were not on our bill when it was presented. I handed our server my credit card along with the bill for which he stated ""Oh, I still have to add in the coffee's."" At that point I would have just comp'd the coffee's. But hey business is business. 
    Lastly I made reservations on open table and noted a ""Celebration"" which it was my sons 100th subscriber on youtube. It wasn't  acknowledged at all. It would be nice for the manager to be on top of those details. At full retail it would be nice to get a scoop of ice cream or something.
    Overall great experience. Sea and sky will be earning my future restaurant dollars. Read more We waited for our food for so long. We arrived at 7:30pm and left at close to 10pm. There was about 40 min between plates. We were so hungry! The sizes of the food were so small and the taste wasn’t impressive at all… so bland and boring. The space was so loud with people’s conversations bouncing all around the room. Not a good experience. The price not worth the food or the experience. Read more Was really surprised how empty the restaurant was for being inside a hotel. Maybe it was because we dined on a weekday. The views are beautiful and the menu had breakfast, lunch, and dinner offerings. My friend ended up having an allergic reaction, which was unfortunate. Hard to know if it was a result of anything she ate. Read more Server was very slow, didn’t seem to be focused on our group of 6. Our appetizers showed before the drinks did.

Great. The food was delicious! The view was beautiful. Or first experience since the  remodel. We will return! Read more Excellent service and food. Phenomenal views!!!! Outstanding and I highly recommend.  Some excellent dishes and some just ok. Heavy on salt which we normally like but it was too much . Scallops were not cooked enough.  Read more What a beautiful VIEW! Overlooking La Jolla from a bird’s eye view at sunset was enchanting for celebrating our anniversary. Our server was wonderful (I think her name was Terry?)…very attentive and helpful with her recommendations. We started with a cocktail (Old Fashioned), which was good. The oysters appetizer were some of the best I’ve tasted. We had a second round they were so good! The Parker House rolls…not so great. First round was borderline burnt; and they were generous enough to bring another round, which looked perfect, but were dry on the inside. A little disappointing. My scallops over polenta were wonderful; but my husband’s Pappardelle was not to his liking. It was tasty, but the texture was rather dry-ish…maybe a little too al dente? They were kind enough to adjust the bill; and they brought us a nice complimentary chocolate mousse desert to share for our anniversary. Overall good experience, but not our best ever. I’d go back for a sunset cocktail and oysters at the bar for sure. We truly loved the  venue; and the noise level was a non- issue on a weeknight at dinner time; and we enjoyed opening the slider for a bit of a sea breeze during dessert. Read more Well, it has been a long time since I've been to the top of LJ Hotel. 9.10.24, 6:30 Open Table. We had a great experience, even though I was skeptical.  We had Sea Bass and Pork Chop. Yummy ! Too much food, but had some for dogs which they loved. Nice sunset overlooking LJ Cove. The drunkish or loose patrons were having a ball in the other north room. And we were the only other people there. More folks would have been better. I hope whoever is running the show now succeeds in a thriving restaurant,  as we live in Pt Loma. Always dining out, looking for the best view. We sure had it tonight. Thank you. Glad you popped up on Open Table. Read more Our wait  person Eddie was very kind and friendly and attentive.

Marketing Dept needs to remov name and menu of former restaurant from Hilton website. 

And when will they fix elevator? Out of order for months since latest “grand” reopening. 

Hilton mgmt. isn’t helping Sea and Ski thrive. Read more Loved the live jazz music, spectacular views, great food, good prices!  Great hotel restaurant (on 12th floor of Hotel La Jolla outside of village also serves breakfast and lunch in same space) with an amazing view. Dinner was very good from the house bread, crab cake starter is good, excellent but small serving of Pappardelle pasta with veggies and 1/2 red snapper. Nice cocktails and light wine menu. Dessert can be skipped but there are choices. Come for the View and stay for Food! Will cone back for Happy Hour. Read more View is great.  The remodel is nice.  The staff are engaging.  The food in the menu doesn’t translate to what you receive.  Be sure to ask exactly what’s in the dish and how prepared.  Example: their reference to  Caesar salad is actually roasted broccolini and cauliflower in a Caesar style.  It was good but just be sure you ask for details.  Also thought the bar menu had more options than the dinner menu.  Which you could get either menu at the table.  End of story: would go back and try again for sure. Read more Our server Arthur was excellent.  The dishes all were great. I really  liked the bone marrow.  First off, how can you go wrong in San Diego with an ocean view? With Sea & Sky on the top floor, the sunset was stellar. Our server, Steve, gave his opinion which included his favorites… the food & drinks were over the top! We were celebrating my girlfriend’s birthday and the dessert, shaved ice, was healthy AND refreshing. Read more Great service.  Good for a business meeting. Amazing view.  Read more Everything on the menu we had was amazing, haven’t had a meal like this in so long where everything we got we liked. We went brunch and dinner and it was sooooo good!  Beautiful food and spectacular view!  Will be back to try their dinner menu!  Food was OK, nothing spectacular.
Service was OK.  Servers need to listen to special requests from customers, like how we want our eggs (overeasy, medium, etc.) and bread  LIGHTLY toasted.
I enjoyed the live music and the beautiful view! Read more Well, this used to be one of my favorite breakfast places. The menu is limited. Nothing special. No offering of eggs Benedict or lemon ricotta pancakes on previous menus. Asked for eggs over medium and they came hard and dry with burnt whites. Toast was hard, dry and cold served with a side of butter. Not appetizing. Coffee is weak. There was a jazz band playing that made it hard to carry on a conversation. View is what this restaurant is noted for, but the menu and food is mediocre. Read more I recently had some good friends dine here who were ranting and raving about this place. So I thought I'd check it out and see for myself. I can see why! We went during happy hour, which did not disappoint! Food was amazing, drinks were top notch and service was excellent! Oh, and the view was incredible! I usually avoid La Jolla because of the traffic and parking is usually challenging. However this is conveniently located off the main road into La Jolla. I will definitely be returning and telling all my friends and family about this hidden gem! Read more Great, fresh food. Service was friendly. View was amazing. Would definitely come back!  Oh my! Are you a foodie? Do you like depth of flavor? If you answered, yes to either of those questions what are you waiting for first let me tell you about the oysters. They are FLAVOR bombs! Probably the best oyster I can ever remember. Every dish we had after that was equally as spectacular. The wine selection is very perfectly paired with the flavor profiles in their dishes we live locally, but I would travel miles to come back here again. They have remodeled beautifully and done everything right! As an added bonus, you have the beautiful view of La Jolla from the 11th floor.  The service staff was very attentive. Read more yummy food and beautiful spot. elevator slow though. service was really good.  Best view in town, enjoyed the bar with friends for dinner.

The DJ was having a wonderful time dancing in place.  We asked the waiter if he had any pull in reducing the volume somewhat.

Overall we were satisfied with our meal and the ambiance was quiet and relaxing.  What a great treat! My wife and I had a wonderful dinner and some really great cocktails while listening to some great music by a really awesome DJ! What a great speakeasy experience. We will definitely be going back for each vinyl night. This will definitely be a regular date night for us. Read more What a fantastic experience! Yummy food. Great atmosphere. And most importantly… WONDERFUL staff.
Cece (pardon my spelling) was our incredible server. A lovely and vivacious French beauty. She was so helpful when we pummeled her with questions and recommendation requests!!

We also had a fun and very personable wait staff (who I regret not getting his name!) it was his first day on the job and he added SO much to our evening!

My two sisters, my 86 year old mother, and myself, were celebrating LIFE! It was the anniversary of when I almost died from a brain hemorrhage, and based on the wonderful reviews I decided to try Beeside Balcony for our intimate party. The food was perfect. Our balcony seaside view was just what I had envisioned. But the staff took it to the next level.
The artichoke hummus with pita chips was amazing. The beet salad with arugula hit the mark. The Bolognese dish was our favorite of the night. And the lemon tart did not disappoint!
WE WILL BE BACK! Read more Went during restaurant week. Good service, nice design/setup. Would come back again.  Good location and the atmosphere was very pleasant. The three dip appetizer was very tasty but all the main dishes lacked a good flavor. Everything had nutty seasoning or, lacked flavor. The octopus was very chewy and overcooked. Service was friendly but very slow. Read more Nice change of pace from normal bars, vinyl nights are great.  Always enjoy this place. Great views and good food.  No energy!  My chicken was super dry.  The drinks i liked.  We loved this place! The vibe inside was great-clean and modern. The food and drinks were excellent and also nice service as well. The lamb chop was cooked perfect and we loved the bee's board-such a great array of spreads to enjoy. And of course, beautiful views! It was decently crowded without feeling overwhelmingly loud and chaotic for a weekend evening. We will be back! Read more Read more Food and service where amazing, also the view and atmosphere are very nice. The Branzino was excellent.  After arriving a few minutes early and being seated, we sat for almost fifteen minutes without being acknowledged at all by a server. There was only one other party of two people in the space, so it wasn’t a busy thing. We finally got up and left without anyone approaching us at all (other than the hostess who sat us). Would not recommend or go back Read more great spot. great food. great service. enjoyed the lunch!  Beside Balcony has a nice patio with a small view of the ocean. The service was good, but maybe a little slow because they didn't have enough service that evening. I did find that ordering took a little longer than I expected and getting our food took even longer.

We started with a crab cake which was very good, I had the Bolognese and my friend had the spicy octopus, we shared Feta Fries which we both liked. Both of our main dishes we're good, Read more The service was perfection. Our server was warm, attentive and at each point of connection always assured us it was okay to take our time.
The touch of honey and lovely presentation with small flowers and fresh springs of thyme was lovely. Read more The food and drinks were pretty good but the bites have a very small portion size. The sliders at least come with truffle fries but the meatball is just 2 meatballs in some sauce. It starts to get really loud once the tables get seated. Read more Super cute place with a gorgeous view! The cocktails were incredible and the food tasty. Highly recommend!!!  I had high hopes for this location because I love the Beeside balcony in Del Mar and have been going to that location for years without any complaints. But the food at La Jolla was subpar, and the service was lacking. Disappointed in the brussels sprouts side. It came out as shredded brussels sprouts with way too many onions! Half of the skillet was filled with cooked onions. Pretty disappointing. And really small portion. I probably won’t come back to this location. But I will continue going to the Del Mar location as it never has steered me wrong! Read more Great little spot! Live music on the patio during the summer.  Service lady was not nice , we told her it’s a Birthday do you have a celebration dessert , she said it’s a scope of ice cream. And then she said is it today ? I said no ,is this  month.  Then she never came  back to talk to us , pretty rude attitude. Read more Read more Beeside was great! We made a last-minute reservation for a group of 10, and they were able to accommodate us well. Our server was charming, attentive, and fun. The cocktails were delightfully delicious: favorites among our group were the Lavender Bee's Knees, Apricot Honey House, and Strawberry Fields Martini. The food was also delicous-we had both of the fries, which were perfectly crispy and the truffle ketchup was amazing. Our group gobbled up the trio of dips, and got more artichoke hummus because it was so good.
Favorite entrees in our group were the scallops, the tofu quinoa, and the pesto shrimp linguini. 
Beeside is on my return list for next time I'm in town! Read more We absolutely loved our evening at Beeside Balcony. The food was fantastic, (loved the baked oysters!), our server was very fun, the view on the patio was special, the owner spinning Buena Vista Social Club tunes most of the night was a vibe all in itself. I highly recommend this place, we’ll go back for sure! Read more A sweet anniversary card and greetings from the staff made the night feel special. Server Eric provided the perfect level of service. The food and cocktails were excellent — I liked that the margarita wasn’t too sweet, and the “sensory overload” cocktail was delicious and fun. Nice atmosphere. Buzz without too much noise. We’ll be back! Read more We were a party of 8, which can be challenging, but we had wonderful service. We ordered plates to share as well as entrées and all was excellent. There was lovely music, not too loud, and the overall volume within the restaurant was perfect—easy to hear each other. Highly recommend this little gem of a restaurant.

Bring comfortable shoes,  if you plan to spend the day for brunch, and walk the many shops and ocean views. Would definitely come again.

Reasonbly priced with a nice outdoor terrace with a peek Ocean View in the heart of La Jolla  on Prospect Street.  Drinks, service food, and music were all fantastic.

The dinner was wonderful from checking in and getting seated through dessert and departure. The folks at the front desk found our reservation right away and had us seated in minutes. Our server was Adam who has been at PCG for decades. He is friendly informative, and knows the menu inside and out. He answered our questions and made good suggestions with explanations. The birthday girl had seared ahi and I had my usual, paella. At Adam’s suggestion, we tried the shrimp dumplings - wonderful. The sauce is to die for - I could take it in a cup to go. Our meals were prepared perfectly. We watched the sun set as we ate our meal. All the support staff was wonderful as well. For birthday dessert, Adam brought us their yummy bread pudding with caramel sauce. I cannot overstate how wonderful the entire evening was. Thanks, Adam, and the rest of the PCG crew! You’re the best! Read more Nice ambiance with ocean view. Upper deck afforded us a great view. Menu had a decent offering. Food was very so, so. Service was excellent and unobstusive.

The service was attentive and very pleasant to speak with, the cocktails, appetizers and entrees were outstanding and delicious!  I'm already planning return visit before the year end.

Parking can be tough but they do offer valet parking.  Enjoyed the atmosphere. Read more We made an early dinner reservation. When we arrived there were plenty of tables by the window or outside . Outside was an incredible experience. Spectacularly seated right on the beach for sunset! Food and service were awesome. We love sitting outside versus inside as the noise level inside becomes impossible to communicate with our friends. The patio made my birthday dinner absolutely wonderful! Read more Was ok but just not great food wise. Have been there several times as I only live few blocks away. This time wasn’t the same.

Last weekend, we had long time friends in from New Jersey and wanted them to enjoy a Sunday lunch that had great food and great views - we thought of PCG.  The table/view was perfect and the surf cooperated as well.  Most importantly, we had a wonderful experience with Charles as or server & the food was stellar.  We had to have them try the shrimp dumplings in the port wine sauce - outstanding and one of our favorite appetizers.

All 4 of us ordered different items, and all were excellent. Service was outstanding.  The CEASAR salad was horrible - wilted, brown lettuce with a sour taste.

Highly recommend  Appetizers, primarily rolls, were tasty and nicely portioned. Service was excellent. The quantity of fish in our seabass and halibut entrees was very disappointing. We might come back but will order differently. Read more Food was great. Our waitress was wonderful.  Attentive but not pushy.  Only annoyance is they still put a ""service charge"" on the bill.  Minor, but annoying.  I was dining solo and aaked for a view, but they put me at a table for 2 on the patio, next to the bussing station. My view was all the empty tables of 4. Servers kept walking by me, nobody saying anything like your server will be with you soon. I felt invisible and like I was sitting at the kids table.

Chowder was excellent. Unfortunately, the Halibut tasted like any common whitefish. For $47, I expected the best I'd ever had. By the time the server checked on me I was nearly half done. He offered something else but I didn't feel that was fair since I'd eaten so much. The portions of shrimp and Halibut in the dish were paltry. Taking this off my list of places to go when in town. Read more Outstanding food in an ocean front setting with impeccable service!  Service was excellent; food was a bit overpriced but it was worth as we enjoyed the sunset on the beach by being seated on the patio  The food was very good - however we had a bad night -  the waitperson spilled a full glass of red wine on my wife’s linen jacket- and white pants - we’re going to take them to the dry cleaners but not sure we can save it.

I would definitely return.  Great food. Excellent experience. We will return.  Had heard great things about Solare. The taste of the food was delicious, but we were surprised at how small the portion size was.  Italian restaurants, even fine dining ones, serve plentiful pasta.  At these menu prices, why not serve more of at least the bread and the pasta noodles? Read more Coming from a Sicilian/Italian family I chose the meatball as an appetizer. The flavor of the sauce is an indication of authenticity as well as the taste and texture of the meatball.

Looking forward to bringing the kids sometime soon! Read more Service and food were excellent. We will definitely come back.  We picked this restaurant due to the websites description of it being a “chic and cozy“ Italian restaurant with excellent eggplant Parmesan.

The food was ALL below average - all the pasta dishes were average and many just drowned in cream with little of the flavors in the description and some tasted fishy when they did not contain fish. The special arugula salad again was over dressed and tiny. The server was not particularly friendly. Much better Italian options in Little Italy at this price point.

Coming from OC, I guess the whole neighborhood was kind of weird but totally safe. I walked around after dinner and enjoyed the open green area. Solare's food was great. The chef really tries very hard to make us feel the Italian experience. The cocktails were great. Service was super friendly but definitely understaffed, like many other places.  However, when the owner or manager is behind the bar just sipping wine and cocktails with regulars and other clients' drinks and food are just sitting waiting for someone to take them to the table, I think it is time to come down to reality and move your butt.  Or perhaps this is the kind of place where the locals are enough for management... I don't know. It is in a tourist city and within a tourist area... I would take advantage of those who want to have a great time and spend some good money on drinking and eating good food. Read more We love eating outside at Solare but this time we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere inside.  The tables inside are spaced comfortably apart so you don’t have to hear conversations of surrounding tables.  The wait staff were very attentive, friendly and knowledgable.

After a few minutes more our waitress approached our table and apologized and took off the cost of my drink from the bill. I appreciated the apology and small compensation, but the damage was done since we got such a late start on getting our meal.  We  had a young child with us whose bedtime was looming and it meant that we all had to rush eating our dinners and simultaneously deal with keeping an increasingly tired child from bothering anyone else.

View was excellent. Would go again with a small group.  It was so loud we could hardly hear each other talk. The acoustics in the new deck are not good.  Ordered ""shrimp stuffed with crab, wrapped in bacon"", which normally would be butterflied and then stuffed.  Nope.  This shrimp was whole and seemingly 'rolled in crab' and then wrapped with bacon.  Very little crab could be found and definitely couldn't taste it.  The bacon wrap was too much bacon and overpowered the entire shrimp flavor as it was extremely salty. I didn't complain at the time, although I should have as it was quite pricey for what it was. I don't recommend ordering. Read more Great restaurant chain and this location is solid. Nice views from the deck and great service and food.  Disappointing overall.  We sat outside. Nice view.

Thank you    Hfndbsjsjsjdjdjdjjdjdjdjejrjfnfnfnfnfnf  This is a fun place to go and enjoy the noise and general chaos.  It's a loud and fun place and service is great, and food is even better.  Have been here many times over the years and will be back.  Weekends are best to enjoy the overall experience. Read more Waiter’s service was exceptional. I was hoping the food was going to taste like authentic Mexican food, so I was disappointed the food tasted like frozen food from a box that was heated up. Overall experience though was good. Read more Amazing Birria!! Love coming here to hang out, grab a couple of drinks and eat some delicious Birria. Always a hit and we come here everytime we are in town.  Margaritas were not my favorite.  There's a lot of Mexican restaurants in SD and these margaritas were very sweet. Flight is a good presentation but some were watered down. Food was great presentation also. Food was pretty good. Read more The food is great, but not a fan of the upstairs dining rm.  Always a great time! And amazing food. Can’t ever complain.  Great service, fun atmosphere.  A bit pricy for what it was but overall good.  Read more Waitress offered chips and salsa, and never mentioned it costs extra. Didn’t like the overall vibe/ambiance of this place. The food was mediocre at best. There are so many  dining options around the area. Read more We always have a great time here! Never anything wrong with our meals and never a bad vibe ☺️ we will continue to come at least once a year!  Everything we ordered was delicious. Our server was the best. I can't remember if his name was Samuel or Cesar 🙈 but he was so awesome! We ordered the carne asada quesadilla, the quesabirria, hot cheetos fries, ensenada roll, and pork belly bites. The churro cart was delicious as well for dessert Read more Excellent service our waiter was very tentative and helpful explaining the menu my 3 daughters enjoyed the eall paintings and theme thr restaurant has and to top.it off I got an excellent law enforcement discount Mr tempos is #1 Read more Great happy hour deals on food and drinks! Pork belly nachos were crazy good.  Food is always great here. However, portions are small for the cost. Parking is hard to find here as well.  It was ok this time.
The food was good the service was amazing !  Just okay.  Drinks are full of sugar and not great.  Food was decent but nothing special.  Service was very good.  K&Q is a great take on some of the bars and clubs over the border with a variety of food options. A friend and I met up for dinner I had a margarita flight and enchiladas. We sat inside but I would recommend making a reservation and sitting in the upstairs patio. Super fun and walking distance to many other bars if that’s your scene. Great for groups and a special occasion. Read more I always have a good time @ King & Queen…the food is bomb and so are the drinks (margarita flight anyone?) and the service is always fantastic. Love this place!  Read more Best food in downtown honestly best go to place to hang out in and have great food  Great vibes, seated very quickly, our server, he was the best. Food was off the hooks, drinks as well. Good place to go to during this summer  Music is a little too loud but I love the vibes! I would turn it down just a bit so you can enjoy a bit of conversation. Other than that phenomenal experience!  Service was amazing. Wait staff very knowledgeable and gave very good recommendations. Food came out extremely fast. Food was amazing. Drinks were amazing and made with very good alcohol. Definitely will be back. Very good vibe and ambiance Read more Very dirty, mediocre food and weak drinks. San Diego and Little Italy have much better places to offer.  It was our first time here and everything was great. The drinks were good and there’s so many options. We did a mimosa tower. The brunch food was wonderful! And there’s vegetarian options.  ABSOLUTELY LIVED KING & QUEEN CANTINA! It was my first time last night and the food was SOOO GOOOD!!! It also came out really fast & you have to order the margarita flight  Love the ambiance. Super fast service, only thing was they brought out one persons food 10 min before the other person got their food.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND ENERGY.   Place feels dirty - table tops sticky, floors collecting debris, menus greasy and overall ambiance that of a frat party in Oxnard, California.  Service sketchy and unpleasant.  This place is all about the Up Sell, and if you are even a bit deliberative, the pressure to buy tequila or anything else is tremendous.  There are many other options nearby, so please do yourself a favor and avoid the sewer of a restaurant. Read more Food was delicious. Our server was super nice.

I think any of the entrees and appetizers we had would be sufficient for two.  The beet salad, sea bass, and cauliflower portions were transported home for lunch and dinner today.
We eat out several times a week and I would definitely recommend the Edgewater as a five star experience. Read more Edgewater is a dying breed here in Seaport.  I think once Shorebird and others open it will have to update or be lost.  Edgewater is very 80's, from the menu to the decor to the waitstaff.  Nothing inspired on the menu, but the sourdough bread roll is def worth the $7 and the tomato basil soup is divine.  Everything else is just OK....very pedantic, old school, basic.  Nothing modern or fresh or inspired.  It's a throw back that people either wander into because of its perfect proximity to bay views and sunsets or because of nostalgia for going there for generations.  But with Seaport Village updating and bringing new restaurants with modern chefs, innovative menus and updated vibes, I think Edgewater will suffer.  This go 'round our service was excellent though! Read more The server, Dustin, was amazing. He was friendly, attentive, and even made us laugh. Made great recommendations and the food was delicious! I had the eggs your own way and my friend had the french toast. The coffee was good and we also had the mimosa flight which was a tasty variety. Definitely recommend their brunch! I loved the view of the water and boats passing by and also getting to people watch. Great experience for a first time at Edgewater Grill! Read more Watched the sunset after dining. Great location. Server was outstanding. Servings were very large.  Great location, food was excellent. Service was extremely slow and not good. It may have been an individual server issue since we watched other tables being very well taken care of.

This is a nice restaurant in beautiful Seaport Village, with gorgeous views of Coronado across the bay and boats passing by. The service is excellent.

Wonderful setting/scenery for your meal.  The food was outstanding- fresh, large portions, variety, and reasonably priced.  Service was very good.  We will definitely return.  Waiter with the name of Xochitl gave us a bad service and a hard time. All separate business owners who need their separate checks for business expenses and tax purposes, party of 4 people only, we requested to the waiter to charge us separately for the reasons mentioned before.  She said that would make it to complicated for her stating it was too busy which was not the case, she said she would only do it only if she would charge us a tip as a large group at front only. She charged us 20% gratuity. We then asked her for the copy of our receipts she said she had no way to give us a receipt with her portable terminal. We reminded her a second time we needed receipts for business expense purposes. She still gave us an attitude till I told her to stop saying that we were making her work too hard for our needs when she is getting paid to do her job and she imposed a tip upfront already so she was getting well paid for a service that she is there to provide to her customers. Finally she walk away and brought us receipts back. Read more The food was great! Friendly staff and good service!  Great vibe with a nice view!  Service was terrible. Took a long time to get waited on, waitress ignored us for most of the time. We had to flag down the bus boy to get her twice. Food was just average, and they failed to provide the whole order, had to go back and get the missed potatoes. It wasn't really busy either, so not sure what the problem was. Read more Food was very good and our waitress was great. We had a group of 8 so we were not able to be seated outside even with a reservation. Our table faced the window as the sunset, beautiful, however it was hot and stuffy inside. There were no windows or doors able to be opened and no A/C or fans on. We expressed our discomfort but the problem was not addressed the whole 2 hours we were there. Otherwise it would have been 4-5 stars. Read more Loved our lunch outside overlooking the harbor. Delicious drinks, food and service! Will be back!  We were promptly seated, great ambience. Excellent staff and service was provided but food across the board was just OK.  It took over an hour from arrival to received raw french toast and ice cold eggs.  From beginning to end it was a two hour brunch.  Management never came by to opologize and there was no credit on the bill for the inconvenience.  I’d never go back. Read more Edgewater Grill at Seaport. The view is awesome - we came at sunset.  Sat on the patio which is dog friendly. Their menu has a great selection but my favorite was the poke nachos. I didn't have any but drinks were decent size. The only criticism - value to price could be better . Servers were very attentive but the people bussing the tables could use some training on good customer service (he gave me a dirty look when I wanted to finish the last two fries on my husbands plate - like very NOTICEABLE). Read more Read more Service was a little slow but our waiter was trying and he was very nice.  Excellent food and service. We sat outside and watched the ships going by. We will be back!

We had the fresh catch of the day and carrot cake for dessert. Our server was terrific too! So glad we decided to dine here. It was the all around best of the many restaurants we ate at on the waterfront while we were vacationing here. Read more They sat us right by the boardwalk looking out on the bay. The service was more than excellent. The only negative that I would have to offer is that my vegetables were not cooked enough to my taste. The scallops were great. Read more Great view; tasty food and drinks :) Service was good too  We arrived early, 10 min,for our reservation, we were happy to have a drink and wait to be seated. After 40 minutes I went to the host desk, which was in plain sight to the bar. We were originally told they were backed up, we were patient. The host completely forgot us, when we were finally seated the place was nearly empty. The service was slow, one of the orders was completely wrong. They did comp one of the meals, thank you.
Hopefully it was just a bad night for the staff.
The food though was good. Read more Had the scallops, not great.   Served with giant, hard to eat vegetables and a dry tasting rice blend.  Our Server was fantastic but that’s probably where it stops being great, the food was ok and I mean just ok. We had to send a dish back as it was cold when it came back it had been in a microwave and wasn’t hot but was warm enough but the plate was very warm. The food was ok in general nothing to rave about, the location is great and I think a lot of people probably just have drinks here looking over the water.

But extremely noisy with lots of crying babies  Delicious food and drinks. A little slow in the service (ordering and paying side), but they didn’t have much staff at 5 - 6 pm.

Food tasty however not as described $30 for a sashimi bowl described as 3 pieces of each fish did not happen there was just one piece of ahi.

There was not enough staff so I couldn’t ask for dressing our waitress also was bartending by the time she came by we were done due to time constraints. Read more It’s a great place for a casual lunch but not a special occasion. Very delicious and good service but the ambiance of an all you can eat salad bar place. So many kids made it very noisy.  The bar staff are really friendly and professional. Great place to get good seafood and a cocktail.  Good spot for a low expectation happy hour but we learned the hard way not to have a full meal here. Felt embarrassed for bringing guests here. “Crispy” shrimp tacos were soggy. And while there were 4 “crispy” shrimp on that taco, the seared shrimp taco only had 3 tiny shrimps so it was mostly saucy slaw. My husband’s grilled fish bowl came out 10 min after everyone else’s dinner, and it was the thinnest piece of fish. And this was partially our bad for ordering sushi at a place like this, but yuck. Only sushi roll I’ve ever had with two layers of seaweed inside. It’s all you could taste. And the roll looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Was sloppy and the crusted tuna was not just seared it was mostly cooked through. Not good. Read more Food and ambience was amazing! Service, though was poor. Our server was too serious and cold.

Chose striped Seabass was a bit dry and I didn’t like the Thai curry dressing.  We had dinner there in a Monday to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant was out of the wine we ordered. Also out of some appetizers and main entrees. The flavor was good, tough.  Food and service was fine but a bit less upscale than I was expecting. Kind of a standard mall restaurant. It was fine no complaints. Great if you happen to already be at the mall.  Multiple food items on the menu were not available.

I love pizza salsiccia and try it everywhere I see it on the menu. This pizza at Isola was one of the best ever. The dough, the sauce, the toppings, all perfectly balanced. The fennel taste was present but not overwhelmingly. The pasta carbonara was spot on too. Desserts (panna cotta and the tiramisu) were delicious too.
The only downside was that I truly wanted to have a glass of the Barolo wine of the brother of the restaurateur (Pietro Rinaldi), but they only sell it by the bottle.

We will back soon  A wonderful spot in LJ ! We hadn’t eaten here since before the pandemic and were so pleased to rediscover it. We started with a pizza and the wood-fired cannelini beans which were delicious. We navigated an Italian wine list with the help of the bartender and found the wine we each enjoyed. Cacio de Pepe, sea bass, and squid ink pasta were all amazing.  The food was hot and portions were perfect. Tiramisu and affogato were also wonderful.  Only suggestion is to get the affogato in a dessert bowl or cappuccino cup. It’s difficult to dig thru the ice cream and the espresso is more diluted in the narrow upright cup. I’ve got to have the right ratio of espresso to ice cream in each bite! ;) Read more The food at Isola is always excellent.  The servers are patient and listen when you order.  Chicken & Salmon entrees are very good.  Pizza's are good and pasta's are great.  My favorite appetizer  is the Grilled vegetables with goat cheese. Read more Everything we ordered was so great! Appetizers, saladas & pastas 10 out of 10! But the pizza is definitely 11 out of 10! We love Isola!  The reason for the lower rating is the lie on the website and the manager’s reluctance to adequately rectify the issue. The website advertises $25 for two pizzas on Tuesdays, with no asterisks or indications that this is only for to-go orders, which is what we were told when we were already seated and had ordered our drinks. Then when we brought the false advertising to our waitress’s attention (who was very nice) she asked her manager if they could honor the website’s advertisement and he declined. This was honestly very frustrating considering we wouldn’t have gone out to eat on a Tuesday at isola otherwise…. They should take down the advertisement if they won’t honor it - it’s unethical.

I ordered meatballs as an appetizer. The sauce on the plate was cold, one of the meatballs was burnt on top and raw on the bottom, the other one had the texture as if it was boiled. The medium rare Denver steak I ordered came out blue. My wife’s fish was overcooked and dry. The dessert, a lemon tart, was also a contradiction; the crust was burnt and dry, but the curd was runny and not set.

Read more Salmon Ballantine appetizer was new to my wife and me and we liked it. My Osso Buco was tender but the flavor was ruined by cooking it with far too much rosemary. My wife’s Denver steak with fries was decent. Our server and host were attentive but there was too much time between visits to our table, apparently due to inadequate staffing. The bread pudding was generous in size for us to share but a terrible flavor despite the fresh blackberries and slices of strawberries.

The cost exceeded the value of our meals Read more My husband and I went for lunch during restaurant week.

The seating was chaotic even though we made a reservation. I was waiting in the long line to get to the front but apparently multiple people thought they should go first so I got cut in line twice even when I was finally at the front. The hostess didn’t seem like she was even interested in asking me if I checked in yet when I was waiting until I asked for her attention despite being 3 feet from her across the counter.

The service was friendly but kind of terrible, but probably because they were busy…we got our main entrees before our appetizers came. I had to ask for our appetizers. They went to get it but brought the wrong appetizers. They ended up fixing it but I started eating my entree before my appetizer because I waited a while for my appetizer to come but it took too long and my burger and fries were getting cold. The food was pretty good.. the Mediterranean chicken wrap was better than the salty burger and fries. But it was good… I guess they were too busy to fill our tiny water cups more than once. Their lemon tart was really sweet and I couldn’t stand more than 1 bite. The churros were decent.

Overall, restaurant week experience here was terrible. It was my first time here but I have no intentions to come back for not so great experience. I ended up cancelling my other restaurant week reservation experience elsewhere because it was just so disappointing. Read more Went for brunch - fabulous cocktails and omelets!   The service was exceptional.
Can't wait to return for lunch and/or dinner as the menu looked amazing. Read more B+ food. Scallops very good but lamb shank, seafood risotto, and pesto shrimp pasta were OK but a little bland.  We found the place through OpenTable app and really enjoyed it. There is a free parking space for 2 hours, hosts were nice and helpful, food was tasty and portions were big enough. Also the balcony had the ocean breeze which is romantic. Thank you Read more Read more Service was great

Food excellent.

Too noisy to go with anyone that you want to talk or hear. Read more We come to BeeSide a couple times a year. When we arrived they told us they had double booked and it would be 15 minutes late. There were 26 tops available, but eventually they seated us at a four top that opened. I asked how it double booked when I used a reservation. I was told they can’t predict the future and they’re very busy. Once seated we had no service for 10 minutes so I asked if we had a server. The gentlemen looked shocked and apologized. The blonde waitress came over and said well I guess your server is too busy so I’ll take your order.  By the time we finally got service it was half hour past the reservation. She never refilled our iced teas or checked back. The 2 six tops remained empty until 5 minutes before we left. We could’ve been seated on time and maybe not been handed off to a server who didn’t want to take us. We come there regularly and were made to feel so unwelcome…as though we caused extra work by simply being there.  I feel for how hard it is for small businesses right now, but you literally treated regulars like they were not wanted. Read more Food and service was excellent! I went for lunch and was a little uncomfortable since their roof absorbs heat. It also happened to be a hot day so other than that, I would recommend trying!  The owner and staff, including hostess Libby and server Soliel, were excellent. The menu, which is quite broad and favors seafood, was recently revamped and has several new items which were noted by our server. 
Our dinner entrees were very good although, as I noted to our server. My dinner entree, the scallops, which was recommended by our server, was rather small compared to my partner’s branzino. Would return. Read more Friendly place. Meal offers interesting choices- something for everyone.

This place always has the best service and the best food. 10/10 recommend  Great experience, food was fantastic and big portions  The restaurant was so busy we ended up making a reservation just to sit down. We let the hostess know we were there early in hopes of being seated sooner than our reservation . This didn’t happen so we waited 45 minutes for our table. During that time, we witnessed chaos, from plates breaking, to waiters trying to serve food between the passing crowd to a heater catching on fire.

Once seated, we were given bread which was great. But after ordering our food (lobster ravioli and pasta bolognese), the food tasted very average. Mediocre at best. Not worth the wait at all. We also had the tiramisu which was very dry.

Bathroom is disgusting. Shared with the pizza place under the restaurant and for a “nice restaurant”.. not it. Read more Read more Our food was amazing and the service was top notch.

The food and setting was great (we sat outside). Some issues with homeless people, but nothing too bad.  My best meal yet in town and probably the best pasta I’ve ever had.  Top 3 at least.  The calamari was incredible and had three of the best fried shrimp I’ve ever had.  The carbonara was the best pasta dish I can remember until I had the bolognese which was the standout. The arancini was good but not as good as the rest. ￼I’d fly back from Washington just to eat here again. I’m already booking another reservation this trip. Read more Overall the experience was good.

Food was mediocre. Tasteless and bland. I would have much rather gone to Ang of the other restaurants in old town and it would have cheaper and more fun.

The view was the only nice thing about this place. Read more The view is really nice. The meal was inexpensive. The food was meh.  We tried everything at the buffet, but for one reason or another didn't est much of it. The cookies were burnt, the fruit had flies, the beans were chalky, the enchiladas were cold.

Meat was flavorful and tender. Enchilada was excellent. Nice view.  Food was not as good as expected. My meat and rice were very dry. The view of Old Town is really nice and the hostess and servers are friendly.  Based on reviews my family and I booked a reservation at the Old Town Tequila Factory. I was not aware that the restaurant is up a hill which was not very walkable for my senior citizen mother. When entering you will see a beautiful courtyard with a fountain and many plants. I assumed this is where we would be seated by our outdoor dining reservation. Instead we were taken to the back of the restaurant which is a rooftop patio enclosed in glass which needs a good cleaning. The tables were sticky and overall the ambiance looked like an old fast food joint from the 80s. The inside wasn’t much better (my husband commented it looked like a Bennagin’s). Both the host and waitress were friendly and accommodating. The menu is very limited and basic, not what I would consider a wide range of authentic Mexican food. 3/6 of us had fajitas which were good and tasted fresh and well made but nothing exciting. My husband had a combo plate with an enchilada, chili releno, and taquitos. Again he enjoyed it but it was pretty standard. My dad went to use a hot sauce on the table that was no longer red. It had some watery looking greenish liquid in it. We had to take a bottle from another table. Everyone enjoyed their margaritas. This place has potential but needs a makeover to both its appearance and menu. Read more Alicia was an amazing server and made our experience a wonderful time! Food was good. Patio was beautiful. Thank you for your great service!  We went to San Diego for vacation and stayed at The Hacienda. The food was fantastic and all the servers were awesome.

The buffet stays clean, hot & fresh. They truly have the best variety of items!  We were really looking forward to trying this place out but was disappointed when it came to customer service. The food was okay.  We were initially seated outside and the tables and floor were a mess. We asked to be moved inside and they said yes, but did not show us to a table, so we picked one. I asked a server who passed by if it was ok and she said yes. Unfortunately, the food was cold across the board so it was a bummer. After reading positive reviews, I was excited to try this place, but it sadly didn’t please our party. Read more Read more The champagne was hot, the food was cold, the ribs were burnt. The corn was hard as a rock, the beans were salty. The rest of the food was cold.
The server said someone forgot to put the champagne in the refrigerator and we had to deal with it.
We made reservations for the outside patio and were told we could not sit out there , because they had a large party coming. Why wasn’t it blocked out when the reservations were made.
Maria the manager was able to retrieve some cold champagne from the bar and served it to our party. However nothing  could be done about the food.

Would not recommend.  There are too many other Mexican restaurants to visit close by in the area. Read more I recently had the pleasure of dining at Old Town Tequila Factory, and it was a great experience from start to finish. The restaurant's setting is vibrant, perched on a hill overlooking historic Old Town San Diego that set the perfect backdrop for our evening.

The ambiance was both warm and inviting, with beautifully decorated interiors that reflect the rich culture of Mexico. The outdoor seating area, where we chose to dine, was equally impressive, with twinkling lights and comfortable seating that allowed us to fully enjoy the view.

The highlight of our visit, however, was the impeccable service we received from our waitress, Alicia. From the moment we arrived, Alicia greeted us with a genuine smile and a warm welcome. She was attentive without being intrusive, offering recommendations and ensuring that our glasses were never empty.

The food was a feast for both the eyes and the palate. We started with the fresh guacamole and chicken tortilla soup. For the main course, I opted for the 3 item combo which included a carnitas enchilada, chicken taquitos and shredded beef crispy taco. We ended our dining experience with the deep fried ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious.

Overall, our dinner at Old Town Tequila Factory was great. The combination of the view, delicious cuisine, and the outstanding service provided by Alicia made for a memorable evening.

They do not answer when you call them and I was unaware there was a fundraiser going on and the food was just ehh, but overall I had a great time. Good DJ.  This was not a restaurant, as per my search, but a bar with food. The server was pleasant and
the food was bar food. Not even any salsa with the tacos.

The manager went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. I can’t wait to come back! Read more The rooftop is wonderful, the food was not so great and the service was slow. It is definitely a vibe though and the perfect place for a cocktail or two!  Where do I begin? First, the Cielo restaurant is semi difficult to find. We arrived on time at 11am. It was obvious the restaurant was not ready for customers. The staff was moving tables and chairs around. The music was extremely LOUD. We could hardly have a conversation.
The music level was for evening hours when the place is full of single adults.  This was a 11am brunch. Way to loud. We had to hunt down our waitress for our food order and at the end, for the check. The food was ok, nothing to get excited about. The food arrived cool not warm. The kitchen is down below on a different level. By the time it gets cooked and brought up to the table, it was cool. I came to Cielo because I had purchased a Groupon.
I gave my Groupon print out to the waitress. She stated she had to scan it off my cell phone. 
I thought that was strange, since the scan code was on the Groupon paper receipt. I was annoyed and I know the waitress could sense my frustration. While I walked away to try and retrieve the scan code on my cell, the waitress informed us, the manager voided our entire bill. I was super surprised about this. It wasn't so great but in the end, we did not have to pay anything. Read more It is a weird vibe.

From the pictures we were expecting a nice relaxing time on a rooftop. At 7pm the lights and music were set like a nightclub. I could barely hear my friend and all the views from the roof are obstructed by the decor. The menu was limited and not that appealing.

We ordered chips and salsa and then left. Another couple followed us out and we all discussed in the elevator about the weird vibe. Read more We were all looking forward to this dinner to celebrate the bachelorette but unfortunately apparently employees called out that night the place was super short staffed waited over an hour for drinks then another hour for the food for half our table the other half took another 30 minutes and when it came it was cold… the manger did try I will give him that and it’s very unfortunate but our experience was not what we were expecting. Read more Read more Not really a rooftop, it’s not that high at all. Also, I couldn’t understand why it was all covered all around?! The point of the rooftop is to be able to see out freely, but you cannot see at all once you are seated! You have to stand up by the stairs to be able to see the city. Drinks were too expensive, not worth the price. Music was reggaeton the whole time, which I don’t have nothing against playing some, but changed it up a little!

I do recommend a jacket as it does get cool being so high up Read more Nestled high above the vibrant city of San Diego, this rooftop bar and restaurant is a true gem.

The ambiance is chic and inviting. Just a photo shoot waiting to happen. The menu is a crafted culinary delight.

When we made reservations, we asked about the buffet and the woman told us about it.  Then, when we arrived, there was no buffet. It had been discontinued 2 weeks previously!   AND NO Coffee for breakfast?? Very disappointing! We were told we could order from menu and get our value from the groupon, which they honored.

The space is very funky- walked up 5 unfinished floors to roof top.  The space was dirty and very loud with piped in music.  Bathroom was 2 floors down!

View was OK. Menu limited and food was delivered from a kitchen on another floor, so was cold and quite pedestrian.  My wife had a pina colada and it was very good- stick to the drinks! Definitely not worth the value. Read more The service was absolutely terrible, our drinks took about 30min, and then we waited another 30min just for chips and guacamole.

Then when we showed up at 9 (our original reservation was at 8) both kitchens were closed and Rafa disappeared after serving us our champagne.  All they had to eat was tacos and the “steak” (more like ground beef) tacos were not good and the server was not very good either. Read more Unfortunately our experience at Cielo Rooftop lounge for brunch was unsatisfying. I was surprised and disappointed to find out that they didn't serve coffee, which is a basic expectation for any brunch establishment. The music was excessively loud, making it difficult to have a conversation and enjoy the atmosphere. The food took a long time to arrive and when it finally did, it was lukewarm at best. I had to request for utensils after our food came and inappropriate cutlery was provided…I got a butter knife to cut my tough steak entree. The garlic butter sauce option wasn't a sauce; it was more similar to a side of lard. All these issues along with the sketchy entrance, it's safe to say that I will not be returning to this establishment in the future. This restaurant needs to close down and undergo a complete revamp.

The hibachi food is amazing  Read more Super disappointed with this rooftop. Whatever was advertised on Instagram, did not fully reflect. The drinks were ok, also not impressed. The coconut drink was supposed to be served in a coconut shell, and per the server, the coconuts were too expensive for the management opts to no longer use them. The Ferris wheel we purchased was also not charged so we enjoy it for a few seconds before having it taken away to charge, so we didn't have access to out drinks immediately. The food was not great, the garlic noodles lacked flavor. Also, there were not really any opportunities to take cute pictures because certain areas were for specific parties, so they're not accessible to all guests. Went with a group of 12 and we could not wait to leave. The waitress was very sweet and did a great job. Read more The place is decorated very nicely, however there was 1 server for the whole restaurant. Service was extremely slow and owners as well as servers were careless, I had a reservation and as I walked in I was told to sit wherever, they did not have enough umbrellas for the tables and it was extremely hot. 2 tables walked out due to slow service. Food came extremely cold and late. Would not recommend Read more I wouldn’t go back. Couldn’t even talk to people, the music was loud.  Cielo Rooftop Lounge in downtown San Diego offers an enjoyable atmosphere with its rooftop setting, but the experience falls short in terms of food and drinks. The menu doesn't impress, and the drinks lack excitement, making the overall dining experience underwhelming. However, the rooftop ambiance provides a pleasant backdrop for a casual outing. Read more Loved the Brunch events during the weekend!  Always a fun theme and great food and drink deals.  They allowed us to put reservations when there was no room to even stand. It was full of college students. No staff was there to attend us, when we had a reservation. Very unprofessional service. Read more Unfortunately, the themed lesbian brunch didn’t go quite as expected. It seemed they were insanely understaffed, so our brunch for two took 2 1/2 hours. I wish they had told us that they were struggling so much, because it was obvious that only two servers and a few helpers were supporting. Food was delicious when it finally arrived, but it took 25 min from being seated to be greeted, and then 30 more min from taking our food and beverage order to get our cocktails.

Keeping in mind San Diego’s love for craft beers, 7 Mile features rotating taps of many of the local favorites. Dessert is a must in this restaurant, which has a gelato bar and fire pit s'mores.","Read more Everything about 6-Mile Kitchen was wonderful. We had a party of 8 (4 adults & 4 children) & everyone including the kiddies enjoyed dinner. The service was super great! Our casual dining experience included appetizers (calamari, cauliflower & bread), entrees & dessert. The kids had chicken and burgers while the adults ate burgers ( the Wagyu burgers & Kim Chi burgers were a hit). Desserts included a Tres Leches cheesecake & a brownie a la mode that everyone really liked.

The next day we had breakfast for 6 & it too was really nice & despite having to wake up early on a Saturday, the kids enjoyed their food a lot. They really liked the menu items which made it easy.

Great restaurant - we will definitely return next time we’re in town. Read more We were part of a party of 8 (4 adults/4 children). The service was outstanding & the food (appetizers, entrees & desserts) were wonderful.

Everything enjoyed the appetizers which were: cauliflower with hummus, a Thai calamari & pretzel sticks. Amazingly even the kids liked the cauliflower despite the fact that it had a little spice to it, the heat was subtle but really made the dish. You can never go wrong with calamari or pretzels with my family so the three appetizers were a hit.

Three of my grandchildren had the chicken fingers & one had the cheeseburger. All the kids dinners were served with fries which of course were enjoyed by all of them. The adults entrees ranged from the short rib plate to burgers including a kimchi burger  which were also very delicious. Very nice-sized portions so we all got to taste a bit of everything.

We shared two desserts: a brownie a la mode &. Tres leches cheesecake that were both the perfect end to our dinner.

Thank you for a great dinner experience. Read more The pizza we ordered looked frozen and it was void of any type of flavour. I looked at other pictures I found about your restaurant but what we received was just poor. The nachos we had were just weird they had some cream cheese like goo on the nachos they were cold. All it all cardboard pizza for $28.00 and some random starter. We both left feeling empty and we went a got candy bar and went home. For a Sheraton resort I expect a lot more.

I won’t be coming back… Read more I had such a wonderful dinner this weekend with my 12 & 9 yr old kids. The restaurant is located in the Sheraton Carlsbad, conveniently behind Legoland (where we had spent the day). The hostess was welcoming, our server was kind, and even the gentleman filling waters (always so sweet). Great value with the kids meal and overall delicious food. I loved the salmon burger with tater tots. Quiet setting was just what we needed after a busy day and loved sitting outside on a cool night. We'll be back! Read more The server was nice and attentive. The food was not great. We had the peppers as an appetizer but didn’t like the taste/quality of the oil they used to prepare them. I had the salmon burger which was not that tasty and fell apart easily as I ate it. The salad citrus dressing was also strange tasting.

The ice cream was good but you can only get one flavor in a single order. When they brought it it was a big bowl and could have easily fit two or even three flavors in one serving like so many gelaterias do. I would ask them to change that rule. Read more Kind of meh. Was hoping the pappardelle pasta was still on menu but no.  7 mile was a very good restaurant. Close to our hotel and has a great menu. Pizza, salads, burgers- all looked scrumptious, but we opted for a salad this time. We’ll probably be back!  Really nice patio over looking the pool.  Server was great.  The food at dinner was over cooked and not great.  Breakfast in this restaurant was much better.  Good food and good service. Very good cocktails.  I would go back. The restaurant is next to the pool, but there is a barrier so it’s an actual restaurant, not a poolside din experience.  I brought my kids here (age 7 and 10) after a day at Legoland. The server brought me a sample of beer when I was undecided, which was so nice. I ordered the 7 mile short rib burger and it was phenomenal!! Loved it so much. Very messy but delicious. My son said the French fries were the best ever. Sat on the patio overlooking the pool, very kid and dog friendly. Gelato counter next to the bar was fun for the kids to pick out their dessert. Would definitely return! Read more Read more Birthday trip  Great visit & awesome service by Spencer
Would go back as menu was good too  High priced pizza just average nothing exciting  Would not go again  We had to wait 45 minutes to get our food and when it arrived, it was cold.  Always one of our go to restaurants after a long day at Legoland.  It was crowded the night we went  and our appetizer order was delayed.  After our waiter brought it to us he apologized and comp'd the appetizer on our bill without us even asking him to do so.  The entrees arrived soon after and they were delicious as usual. 5 Stars for 7 Mile Kitchen. Read more Service was beyond slow. DO NOT come here if you are in a hurry. Lots of kids running around. Its right by the pool so a lot of people in bathing suits or cover ups and flip flops. Food  was good. Sun was in our faces for the 1st 45 mins though. Read more Mediocre food that was overpriced. Thankfully I had credits and did not have to pay out of pocket. 

Service was poor. They seemed overwhelmed. Server brought my check before we received our food and wanted to know if we wanted dessert. Read more Still thinking about the cheeseburger, it was AMAZING! The food was great quality and nice presentation. Already planning to go back for lunch.

The server was nice but not very attentive. The table had not been wiped before we sat down even though I came to check in and left to get my party from the pool so there was plenty of time. Also my son didn't like his mac n cheese so we reordered him and paid for something else. I let her know, but she didn't even acknowledge it nor offer any remedy. They were out of kids menus and I asked what was on it but she didn't acknowledge me, and then came back about 15 min later. On top
of that, the time it took for food to come out was too long (which I know is not her fault). It was not at all busy at the restaurant so we all left confused by the service but happy with our food. The price point was what I expected for a hotel restaurant. Read more We hail from Chicago, renowned for its pizza, and let me tell you, we adore your pizza. It's brimming with delectable sausage morsels, flavorful cheese, and a one-of-a-kind sauce. The red peppers are thoughtfully scattered and meticulously sliced. While I'm no food critic, I can confidently say this pizza is a must-try. The sweet and spicy sausage is a game-changer!"" 🍕🔥 Read more I've eaten here before on our last couple of trips to Carlsbad. The food always consistently good. This time I tried the cauliflower crust Margherita Pizza, surprisingly delicious.  Read more Online menu was different than actual menu.  Apparently their menu is seasonal so what you see online isn’t necessarily accurate.  Just not great. Service was attentive, but our meals took over 20 minutes to come out and 1 of our party didn’t get hers and had to wait even longer. My food was lukewarm, not hot. My friend’s salad was drenched in dressing. The location has a very vacation vibe and I liked the atmosphere. Maybe come for drinks. Read more I wasn’t expecting the food to be as good as it really was. Very happy will return.  The miso salmon was excellent and our waiter Raymond was terrific.  The burgers are delicious.  service a little slow but expected on Mother’s Day with the crowd.  Love eating with view of both pool and garden area with lots of butterflies and hummingbirds.  Very kind and attentive service.  Loved it, made a great place to eat before going to the Botanical Garden in encinitas.  Only 14 minute drive to get there. Read more Service was super slow!  7 mile kitchen is one of our favorite restaurants and go there often. This time when asked about portion sizes, the waiter oversold us and said the pizzas  and salads were way smaller than they actually were maybe to increase the bill amount?? Ordered  way too much food and spent  over  $300 which we weren't expecting. It was just disappointing since we love this place so much.  Service could have been better overall. Food was great as always though. Read more Menu is primarily burgers. Limited selection. Somewhat poolside.  We had a nice experience. Food was good and the waiter was fine after he warmed up a bit. We wanted to sit outside because there was a nice view￼ but it was too cold and breezy so we sat inside next to the fire. Although there was no warmth coming from the fire the glass was preventing that. Just ambiance.
My husband and I had the salmon burger and it was delicious.￼￼ I’m giving four stars because of the high ceilings, once the place filled up with more people, it got pretty noisy from the echo. Read more Went there lured by the dinner menu showed in open table. They told me they do not know why open table shows a dinner menu. They were not offering such a thing.

The coffee was cold and the Mimosas were horrible.  It wasn't crowded at all - so I really don't think you need a reservation.  They were doing a great job with take out.  Also, I thought it was way too expensive for what we got.  Unfortunately, I have to give it a poor rating. Read more We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at this restaurant.  Everything was excellent from the service to the food to the atmosphere.  Mussels, scallops, shrimp…Fabulous! Outstanding desserts. House red wine was exceptional!
Relaxed upscale ambience.  We had a wonderful time at the French gourmet. We attended for a restaurant week, which was advertised on Facebook. My Mail started off with half a dozen Scargo and a delicious garlic butter sauce. My main course was the petite fillet with french fries and a small side of broccoli. I finished off my meal with their offering of crème brûlée. Other members at my table had the divers scallops, the Napoleon, the strawberry baguette, and the brussels sprouts. I would deathly recommend the brussels sprouts, they were delicious. Read more Super tasty, great service! Loved the moules, creme brûlée and napoleon.  Restaurant week and first time visit! We went early and sat inside. We enjoyed the menu very much! We look forward to coming back and trying the brunch menu.  Seated quickly, friendly staff and service.  French Onion Soup rather bland, onions not caramelized and rather undercooked.  Eggs Benedict was good, nice tarf hollandaise sauce, but country potatoes were greasy and seemed warmed over, not fresh. But the chocolate croissant was amazing!  If you sit outside there are lots of flies, so be aware.  They do have fly spinners but on a small table limits your movements.  To the lady inside yelling at bakery staff, they were lovely and working as fast as they could,  you were ugly and mean.  Must praise staff for their patience and grace. Read more We had never been to this restaurant and came across it during restaurant week. We drove about 40 minutes to get there and I gotta say it was totally worth it. Cute small restaurant with outdoor seating as well. We ordered the French Onion soup and the Snails as an appetizer and they were both great. We ordered the scallops with potatoes and the duck with veggies and they didn't disappoint. We also did the wine pairings and they complemented each plate. The dessert was a vanilla strawberry cake and my husband had the tiramisu, both were amazing paired with champagne. We would definitely return and glad we gave it a shot! Read more A nice prefix for restaurant week.  We had excellent service and the food was really outstanding for the offered dishes!  A neighborhood staple that we love.  Not very good food. Cold potatoes, over cooked duck and too greasy. Our drinks did not come out until after our appetizers.  Read more Restaurant Week menu was wonderful,  Loved the food and the ambiance.  Disappointed in the French Gourmet.  We tried it for restaurant week.  First, the table was full of bread crumbs. Second, I asked what cheese the onion soup gratinee had, and the waiter said swiss cheese.  That is not the traditional cheese, it should be gruyere.  So I didn't order it, though that's what I'd hope to have.  My main dish came with lukewarm potatoes au gratin with a tasteless sauce.  The duck confit was so-so -- tough meat.  My husband's steak au poivre had no noticeable poivre.  The creme brulee was the worst I'd ever had; not a very smooth texture, and served in a small takeout tin.  The brussels sprouts in duck fat, though, were delicious and plentiful. Read more Great food and certainly worth the drive wherever you are coming from.  The menu for Restaurant Week could not have been better...very ""French"" offerings and variety for every taste.  My only issue is the extremely tight quarters.  So many tables in such a tiny space, but I suppose it has to be that way in order to pay the rent and maintain such high quality food.  I will say that the type of people who visit The French Gourmet are not prone to loud talking or trying to share their conversation with anyone seated around.  Very attentive service.  All in all, a good overall experience.
I'd like to mention that the entrance to the restaurant is through the bakery and many food items for sale.  This  is a bit confusing if you've never been here before.  I intentionally blocked my view of that section so I don't inhale everything and gain 100+ pounds overnight. Read more French onion soup just ok. Chicken Marsala chicken breast was tough, scalloped potatoes like warm. Napoleon tough; hard to eat. Service attentive at times and then waited a long time to get the check. Read more My husband and I took advantage of restaurant week. We had steak & frites, French dip, escargot & French soup. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. Alex was our server and she was exceptionally attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We will definitely come back. Loved the food, atmosphere and service was amazing. Read more Went to The French Gourmet during the first day of San Diego Restaurant Week and had an absolutely fabulous brunch.. first off I have to rave about our waitress Alexandra who was absolutely the nicest and most accommodating waitress we’ve had in a long while. my wife and I shared the House made duck pâté which was a perfect appetizer for our main courses. my wife had the croissant breakfast sandwich which she thoroughly enjoyed. I had the Flat Iron Steak and Pom Frites and my steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare that was sooo tender! And we only had one appetizer because we both wanted a piece of the delicious Napoleon, which we had to box up and take home because we were full because couldn’t get enough of the crispy French baguette. All in all a most special Sunday Brunch during San Diego Restaurant Week!! Read more Our server was attentive and kind. The food was great as always. We had our wedding catered by French Gourmet.  I booked a 20 person reservation at the French gourmet for my birthday and we essentially took up the whole side patio and it was super nice. We had a waiter designated for us making drinks in the back and the lighting was super cute super attentive 10 out of 10 would go back with a big party or just for dinner! Read more This was our first time actually eating at the restaurant. Being parishioners at OMC, we have enjoyed French Gourmet's catered meals many times and appreciated the convenience of meals that we could order online and pick up at OMC during the pandemic. So while already familiar with the quality of the meals, we enjoyed finally being able to experience the quality service that was provided by our server, Adrian. An enjoyable date night for my wife and I and we will be back since while we thought the delicious Saturday night special prime rib was delicious and I was impressed by both the tastiness and portion size of my beet salad, there are many other menu items that I am anxious to try..... Read more Always a great meal, and service is exceptional.
One of our favorite spots.  Read more All 3 entrees were excellent. Mark the server is very good at his job. The ambiance is perfect for a relaxing evening with friends.  Filet mignon great,!! Service explendid. You got to go!!  Generously sized omelette, but unfortunately overcooked.
Flies were a constant nuisance through entire meal…and not just one or two. We used our napkins to cover the food it was so bad. At end of the meal while paying the check we noticed a table across the room had a fly fan. When asked if they brought that with them, server said no we have them mostly for outside. Why didn’t the server offer us one? Probably because we only saw him 3 times; when he took our  order, brought the food, and brought the check.
1130am Monday was active (about 7-8 tables) inside  but not full, and 1 single person seated outside on patio.
Maybe they were short staffed.  That said, for an $87 breakfast (no alcohol) would you say it was a good deal??   I don’t.  Disappointed, Read more Our server, Mark, was fantastic. Engaging, friendly and offered phenomenal advice on selections.  We enjoyed  a wonderful meal.  We ate outside and the noise level was modest.  We will return.  Service was nice but fairly slow. I ordered the steak and when asked by the waiter how I wanted it cooked, I said ""chef's choice."" That was a mistake, because it came out so well done that I shook the table trying to saw into it with the steak knife provided. The dessert cake was also dried out. Read more We had a delicious meal which consisted of three appetizers, a salad and a shared entree with creme brulee for dessert. The escargot was swimming in a delicious garlic butter, crab cakes had a mouth watering crunch and the brussel sprouts were sautéed to perfection. The roasted beet salad came packed with creamy goat cheese in a tangy vinegarette, while our scallop entree was out of this world. Add to that a tasty glass of Medoc and the aforementioned creme brulee, my date and I both left the restaurant extremely satisfied. Read more NEIGHBORHOOD GEM...cute French restaurant and bakery.

Exceptional service and truly the best Italian food San Diego has to offer. The staff are warm and friendly. Tavola Nostra will forever be our Favorite ❤️  Hearty Italian fare. Excellent sauces. Bright, tangy fresh salads. Pizzas were also quite good, although I would argue (as a guy who grew up in Brooklyn) that the ""Brooklyn-style"" crust is not Brooklyn-style. A little too light, and not enough chew. It was, however, friggin' delicous. Our server was very attentive and had a great smile. The only negative for me was the noise level...

There isn’t a valet and street parking is limited. I’d suggest an Uber if you can. Otherwise you will be hunting for a pay lot or parking meter. Read more One of the best food I’ve ever had in San Diego and would def go back again  Kelsey is an incredible server and is so competent and caring. Our food was delicious and met all of our expectations. Thank you.  Great place for a girls birthday lunch!  The food, service, and ambiance were amazing.    And the view was beautiful as we had a table next to the window and they had the windows wide open to see the beach below. Read more Great place to go!  It’s our third time eating there.  It’s been a great experience, except that we only get there once or twice a year.  Make no mistake, WaterBar is a BAR.  Granted it is a bar trying to up its food game, but it is still a bar, not a restaurant.  When I looked at the 'full menu' on the Open Table website, there were entrees on the menu that give the impression of a more 'fine dining' experience.  It was anything but that.  When we arrived at 6:45pm on a Sunday night, there was a doorman checking IDs (first clue), then when we walked upstairs, we were hit by the loud crowd noise.  There were a lot of people there in beach attire having drinks.  To be fair, WaterBar is right on the beach.  You enter off the beach sidewalk.  When we were seated, we got the menus and found that very few of the entree selections from the Open Table website were on there.  It was a bar menu.  Slightly elevated, but still a bar menu.  We also got the distinct impression that our waitress was trying to turn the table quickly.  We told her we didn't want to be rushed and that took care of things.  Wine and cocktail selections were decent but a little pricey.  We started with the Fried Calamari and the Caesar salad.  Neither one was particularly special, but they were fine.  My wife had the Seared Salmon as her entree and thought it was delicious.  I had the Fish and Chips and it was good, but nothing special.  There were a couple of other things on the menu that looked interesting.  We asked about the Branzino (only served on weekends) and at 6:45pm they were ""all out"".  Suspect, in my opinion.  Prices for entrees are not cheap ranging from $30 to $48, with most toward the high side.  I would expect these prices from a nice restaurant but not elevated bar food.  Bottom line, go for the drinks, burgers, apps and tacos.  For fine dining, try another place.  BTW, Open Table charges a $25 per person fee to make a reservation.  Skip that.  The place is huge.  You don't need a reservation unless you want one of the 6 booths.  WaterBar should figure out what they really want to be, but fine dining, they are not. Read more Music is too loud & annoying!  View is beautiful. We had fish and chips & clam chowder. Food was ok. Chowder was barely warmed. Go for the sunset. Get drinks & skip the food.  Fantastic!  Food was very very good.  Great service and nice ambiance  We had a great time. The food and view was amazing! I’d definitely go back!  Read more Always a vibe! Food is delicious, drinks are tasty, and staff is always chill.  Multiple mistakes in our orders. I didn’t like the chilaquiles and my wife was unimpressed with the crab cakes. Kids French toast was a small portion even for kids sizes. Waitress was friendly, but they were understaffed and she couldn’t keep up with our group. Read more Started with Calamari which was very good. Had Fish and chips for meal. It was pretty good. View of ocean was a plus  It was quite loud for people who wanted to talk about semi-important things. This is not a good place for a ""first-date"".  Also, the fries were on the cold side, but the entree (fish) was warm enough.  They gladly served us another plate of fries. Read more delicious! one of my favorite restaurants! love the view!  Yummy Bottomless Mimosas.  Server was very attentive and kept the glasses full.  Breakfast was food and the view was always was great.  Always enjoy the sunset and food here. The window tables are definitely the best spot.  We LOVE dining at Waterbar-San Diego! However, the Memorial Day weekend was the typical 'May gray' weather. We had a reservation at 10 am, so it was good for us, as the restaurant was not yet busy. Our server was great and very sweet! As for the food, three, out of the six of us, had a cold potato experience:  one being the french fries, and two being the diced potatoes, which my adult son swore were packaged frozen, diced potatoes he had seen in a grocery store. If the restaurant had been busy, at the time we were there, then we would have understood, but as it wasn't busy there was no excuse for cold potatoes. We are not a picky crowd, so no one in our group brought it to our server's attention but otherwise it was a disappointment. Read more Christoval our waiter made the day- great service and good food.  Ordered the appetizer of Lobster Spinach dip…it was excellent!

Ordered the Pear and Arugula salad for my hubby and I to share.  It was good but was really skimpy on the pears.

My husband ordered the Vegetable Curry Bowl with shrimp…which had excellent flavor.  I ordered the Branzino.   Menu did not mentioned that it is served whole.   Not a problem…just sent it back and asked for the head to be removed (I just don’t find it appetizing…and most menus state when the fish is served whole.) Server brought it back and  it was full of bones…but again…it’s fish…so that can happen.  The real issue is that there was absolutely zero flavor to the fish.  No seasoning…no sauce…nothing.  I had to season with some salt and pepper from the table….it was very disappointing.

A very nice experience prior to a nearby concert!  First time saying at Ketch. Per concept dinner date.

I was super impressed with the dishes they had. We love Brussels sprouts and Ketch’s recipe and prep was amazing.

Their Ketch beers were really good too and my wife enjoyed the delicious cocktails.

Their only negative comment was that the Cauliflower steak was a little under done so too crunchy for our liking but maybe that’s the way those are served. We did inform the staff and they were kind enough to take that item off of our bill - so they are a stand up restaurant that takes the voice of the customer seriously.

Highly recommend this restaurant and location if wanting a dinner night out by the harbor in Point Loma. Read more I've always had great experiences at this location until this time. We went for lunch at 1:30 pm, along with many other people after sailing on the Triton.
The restaurant seated more people than they could accommodate. The food was ready to be delivered to the tables, but there weren't enough servers to serve it. We waited a long time only to be served cold food that had been under the heat lamps, too long.
An idea would be to reduce the number of available tables to match the number of available servers, and to serve the food while it's fresh and hot.
Another complaint is with all the MGF options, I believe gluten-free bread should be available, or at least the menu should clearly state that gluten-free bread is not available. Read more First time! Lobster & Shrimp appetizer and fish taco (Mahi) were excellent. Service excellent. I'll be back.  Great place for lunch.  I didn’t need reservations although I made them.

Spicy margaritas were great.

The apps we got, the Beef Tartar hand rolls was so unique and GREAT! The Banh Mi Balls are a have to try! Wow.
But the Neptune cut Swordfish was huge but… was swimming in oil. Literally floating in oil. They said it was butter but it was so oily it had to be oil. There was no swordfish flavor and for $74 was a disappointment. Could not eat it.
The 16 oz boneless Ribeye was cooked perfectly and  the butter garlic was not floating but got absorbed by the steak.

There are lots of high end restaurant choices, might return for lunch but not sure for dinner.

Everything was prepared to perfection! The service was impeccable and professional. We dined outside on the patio overlooking the lagoon and the 18th green.

It could not have been nicer!

Always a fantastic dining experience at a gorgeous venue! Read more Read more Better than expected. Beautiful setting, excellent menu and the best steak ever.  We came to Ember and Rye, and it was our first time here since the venue changed its name from the Argyle.  it was expensive then and it’s even more expensive now which is why we took advantage of coming here during San Diego restaurant week. We came here for lunch and were able to choose from several starters, entrées, and a pineapple dessert.  Service was great however it was a chilly day by San Diego standards and even though we ate inside, it was still chilly in the restaurant. The restaurant was not very full, it would’ve been nice if they closed the door that was open leading to the patio.

My husband chose the Caesar salad, which was primarily kale with some Parmesan cheese and some croissant croutons while I had the beet and strawberry salad.  My salad was very good however a tad overdressed as was my husband’s.  I feel it is better always to underdress a salad and have the customer ask for more versus have the salad in too much dressing.

For her main entrée, I had the grilled fish tacos, and my husband had the bucatini vegetarian pasta. Both entrées were generously sized and cooked to perfection. Finally, the pineapple cake, dessert that we both received was tasty, not great but not bad either we split one cake and packaged up the other one to take home.

This restaurant sits on the 18th hole of the beautiful Aviara golf course and boasts a stunning bar and amazing views.  A great venue if you’re entertaining clients or on a business lunch, but even with the San Diego restaurant week discount, we still paid $110 with tip for lunch. Read more My husband and I went here for the first time to celebrate our 6th year wedding anniversary and it did not disappoint. We were greeted with Champagne to toast to our anniversary (so thoughtful) and they also gave us a delicious piece of cake at the end of our meal! The food, I don't even know what to say, its 10/10. The Denver steak is one of the best steaks I have ever tasted. My husband was torn with what to get but he ended up with the burger - one of the best burger he's ever had. Our waitress, Erica, was amazing. She was so sweet and her food recommendations were on point. Everyone was so nice and they made us feel special celebrating our anniversary. We will be back, thank you so much for the hospitality Ember & Rye! Read more Very nice atmosphere, great service and food was exceptional.  Hamburger was a bit undercooked but still tasty.  I was disappointed that at 11:30 the restaurant was totally empty!  Also, that for $40 we had a choice of burgers or tacos and that the salad which claimed to be Caesar had a vinegarete of some kind and very pale head lettuce instead of kale (of course there was mostly lettuce except for the good tasting croissant croutons.)

It took a long time to get served considering the amount of people in the restaurant.  I asked for coffee when the dessert arrived but none was prepared ahead of time as they make it as they go in a press so I skipped the coffee due to time.

The dessert was not optional choices but was pretty good if you like pineapple!

I guess for what we could order I think that over $80 is too much for that lunch! Read more Very expensive for pretty average food. The server literally read the whole menu to us before we ordered which was weird and annoying. My garlic croissant never turned up (they don’t serve bread).

Read more It was a great experience overall. We celebrated my daughter’s birthday and she specifically requested for us to dine here. There were minor changes from the previous iteration of this restaurant but the main changes had to do with their meat selection which, I thought, was for the better. The only thing that kind of disappointed were the oysters which had a sweet cucumber ice thing on top which masked the natural flavor of the oysters. For the most part, I think people like oysters for what they are and how they taste. Other than that, everything was great. Lastly, do order the croissant - they are a must. Read more Read more Stunning views, relaxing ambience, amazing food, and excellent service.  What else can you ask for?  This was our first visit for my husband’s birthday.  We waited in the bar which is a lovely setting overlooking the lagoon and golf course.  For dinner we shared the appetizer and each had a salad.  Both were delicious.  My husband had the veal chop which was superb.  I had hoped for a nice seafood but there was only a pasta dish or salmon (which we have at home at lot), so I got the pasta.  It had a small amount of crab and lobster but was mostly pasta which was disappointing but the dish was good.  We didn’t order dessert, but we were treated to a fabulous slice of chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting.  It was amazing.  Wine selection was good even by the glass as this is a one goblet spectator restaurant.  overall we greatly enjoyed the restaurant and will return.  I plan to order one of the steaks next time..

We were impressed with the serving size and, as previously stated, the food was cooked to perfection. The price was reasonable for the meal, and we would return there to eat again.

Currently doing some construction, so it was a little chilly in there. Overall a great lunch!  We went for the Christmas trivia.  It was fun
Everything was great until our waiter went home and we didn’t know and we were forgotten about.   We waited for over 30 minutes to pay.   We then waited by the host stand to try to pay.  We almost left. Read more It was awesome, loved trivia night. Good service, good questions.  Great customer service. Open for my family who arrived thanksgiving evening. Enjoyed the food.  Food was undercooked and mediocre. Took 30 minutes to get chips and guacamole. The Town & Country is a cool hang, but all food options are lackluster.  Went for Friends Trivia, it was fun.  Would go back and do it again.  This is our favorite lunch place! Love the tacos and chicken sandwich. This is a regular staple for us on a bi-weekly basis. Highly recommend grabbing a bite to eat plus ambiance in the resort isn’t bad either. Read more They didn’t offer regular breakfast. It’s a weird breakfast buffet thing that didn’t have a lot of choices and was honestly extremely overpriced. The food wasn’t very good, I’ve had better free breakfasts at a hotel lobby to be completely honest. It was not worth the money. Read more Truly exceptional service and food and the view. This was our second time in La Jolla it was the place we were married.  Read more The trivia event at Lapper was well attended.  Not sure they were ready for such a crowd.

One of our favorite places to grab a quick bite to eat and/or drink. We love the location and the food is tasty. We usually get the Lap tacos and their chicken burger and sweet potato fries.  Went here for trivia, the food was okay, pretty pricey for what you get, servers are young and were all standing in the back talking when we walked in, didn’t even notice us for a minute, forgot a drink we ordered. It was clear people were googling answers for trivia, so ended up paying and leaving. Probably won’t return. Read more People are lining up in front and some are just entering in the back door and setting themselves.  We had the reservation at noon and was not served until 1:35pm. I was late to my conference. Waiter gave a 25% discount but I think we should have been given some chips or fruit while we waited that long. Read more We love this place. It’s walking distance for us plus service and food are always on point. The food is delicious. I love their chicken wings and Lap Tacos. Not to mention, they are dog friendly which is a plus for us!!! Neighborhood gem! Read more We made a reservation for 10am on their website and then showed up to be told they close at 10am to prepare for lunch. Very unprofessional.  Great food, amazing service, and well crafted drinks. 10/10 recommend.  I was allowed to make breakfast reservation, which was cancelled morning of because the venue isn’t open for breakfast.

We will definitely be back.  Mom and I very much enjoyed our meal. Food was very good. Server was excellent.  We waited 12 min for someone to take our order and ask for waters. Food did not come out at the same time, one person in our party had to wait 5 more min for their food which totally makes it awkward. An up charge of $2.29 for two microscopic slices of avocado on a Benedict is a joke. Server was nice but slow. We had to ask for basics like silverware, napkins, salt & pepper. Salsa was more like a chunky ketchup. Read more We sat in a booth that appeared to have a leak under. The floor was wet when we arrived but got worse through our brunch. My two kids weee wet. Daughter’s shoes were soaked, and son’s bottom was wet from sitting in the booth.  It appears there is a slab leak as water was coming up from the floor.

Well-known for our signature Clam Chowder, Grilled Swordfish & Crème Brûlée, the Brigantine is a favorite among locals for consistently fresh seafood, succulent steaks & grilled meats.

A favorite destination for locals & tourists alike, the Coronado Brigantine is located in the heart of the village, immediately adjacent to the historic Hotel Del Coronado.

Completely remodeled in 2016, the ""new"" Coronado Brigantine is an elegant adaptation of its former self. The addition of an intimate private dining room, a surround-seating bar and street-side outdoor patio have been equally well-received.

Pork chops and mash for dinner was superb.  Lovely, casual, beach town eatery.  Great sports bar!  Salmon was undercooked and second one was still undercooked and ahi tuna wasn’t very good so they did give us the mahi mahi instead which was very good.

Definitely coming back!! Read more I recently visited Isola and was excited to try their pizza, which I had heard great things about. While the pizza didn’t disappoint—delicious, with a perfect crust—the overall experience was pretty frustrating due to the service.

We weren’t offered water after sitting there for 15 minutes and when we finally ordered a Pelligrino it was luke warm. Our server  barely made an appearance after taking our order. We sat for the entire meal without anyone checking in on us. No refills, no follow-up to see if we needed anything else—just completely absent. The real star of the night was the food runner, who stepped in more than our actual server, making sure our dishes were brought out promptly and even helping with a couple of things our server should have handled.

It’s a shame because the food itself was great, but service plays a huge role in the dining experience. I expected better and left feeling pretty disappointed. Hopefully, management takes note and improves the attention given to customers. Read more Really good! Pizza was excellent! My only issue was the clenliness of tables/chairs- sorry!  Food was great perfect for adults. We had kids in tow and the pizza was a little sophisticated for their taste. No kids menu so your best option is probably the penne Ragu.  We chose this Italian pizzeria for an early dinner before attending a concert in Petco Park. We were very impressed with the Happy Hour menu and prices in general. The food is fresh and delicious.

After ordering our drinks, I noticed a rat scurrying across the floor, which was utterly disgusting and unacceptable. People were screaming and jumping on the chairs. To make matters worse, the manager's response was shockingly indifferent; there was no apology or acknowledgment of the issue, one of the waitress just took a box and put the rat in the box like nothing happened. It's clear that customer safety and hygiene are not priorities here. I won't be returning. Read more Read more Restaurant does not offer air conditioning and inside was warmer than the patio.

Posizione ottima  Great ambiance, good and service. Our waitress was very hospitable and friendly.  We were seated promptly at a very wobbly outdoor table right next to the sidewalk where we were bumped a couple of times. The octopus was excellent and the pizza was good but we had a very long wait in between…maybe 30 minutes. When it was time to leave I pushed back my chair and it collapsed and Inhit my head on the pavement. Barely received an apology from the waiter and other patrons helped me up.

There was also a lot of Nat’s and flys that were quite annoying to deal with. Read more We love Little Italy and really wanted to love this place. The food was really good. Unfortunately, the restaurant was overrun with small flies that we had to swat away the entire meal. (We were inside.) We counted 50 on the booth seats and the wall around our table and even more flying around. We quietly mentioned the flies to our server, and she was very apologetic, saying it was not normal and she would tell her manager. We saw her talk to him and he looked right at us but never came to us to apologize or check on us. In addition, we witnessed another server using her bare hands to lift up a pizza to see if it was burned underneath. (They did not use gloves.) We probably should have left. Read more Wonderful food and service. Fresh tasting Italian food.  Read more Authentic Napoli style wood fire pizza!
Polite and attentive waitstaff.  The patio seating is next to the road - not great. So altho the weather was nice, we still asked to moved inside. The tables are a bit smaller inside, but overall the restaurant is comfortable. The other bad luck was the wine from the owner's brother had some sort of shipping or routing problem. So we could not try that special wine -- our server did suggest a nice Italian wine as a substitute. Pizza (the main reason we went) was delicious. Perfect balance of toppings to cheese. And served at the right temperature. Some places bring it so piping hot you can only stare for 10 minutes. Read more Stephanie was great. Some of the best pizza I’ve had in my life. And I’m from Ny! The cuatro carni very good.  I ordered the salmon. It was overdone  and thin piece. Salad were delicious and pizza always great.  Great food; only negative was the music was up to at too loud so much that we had to ask to turn it down. We also were rushed a bit to leave as Isola needed our table.  We wanted to visit Little Italy one more time for pizza during this trip. I found Isola and decided to give it a try due to its good reviews, and they did not disappoint.

We called to check on their outdoor seating because no online reservations were available. They were very accommodating and seated us at a cozy corner spot, perfect for our dogs to relax and watch the people passing by.

The building, covered with vines, added to the perfect ambiance.

I'm an olive enthusiast, and they brought out a variety of my favorites along with freshly baked, crunchy bread. Shishito peppers, one of my favorite appetizers, were grilled to perfection and didn't need much sauce. I got the hottest one, much to my son’s relief, but we all enjoyed the rest.

The burrata mozzarella was a favorite among the boys. I took a quick bite to approve its goodness. We also shared an arugula and Parma salad. When arugula is fresh, it’s just enough, and the simplicity of the salad was perfect.

After all that, we ordered two pizzas. I love eggplant, so I ordered the Parmigiana a Speck, sans meat. It was delicious, with just the right amount of crunch on the sides. I usually order pizza without cheese, as I prefer not to have dairy overpower the other flavors, and it was just the right amount. The tomato sauce was excellent. My son ordered the Quattro Stagioni and was initially worried about the artichokes but was pleasantly surprised by how good they were.

We finished with tiramisu and gelato, both of which were delightful. Read more Food was great. The outdoor seating wasn't very comfortable and tables were pretty close together.  The food was amazing. My kids even enjoyed it and they are picky eaters!  Isola was an amazing place for dinner, they had great pizza and pasta. The wine selection was amazing and paired perfectly with the food. One downside was the staff was not the friendliest and we felt rushed to order and soon as we finished it felt like they were quick to rush us out even though the place was not busy. The restrooms were also not very well kept and locks did not work properly Read more We came here to celebrate my  graduation. The eggplants were awfully salty. The staff seemed to really want to push the cocktails, and seemed a little distracted / disappointed  that we weren't  ordering more dishes. I don't think we'll  be coming back.

We were very optimistic upon arrival as the restaurant provides a nice ambiance.  Our server was initially attentive and personable.  All of our drinks were great ( kudos to the bartender!).

Had plenty to eat and the server (didn't catch his name) was very attentive.  Food: The table-side guacamole was a highlight, allowing us to customize it to our preferences and dietary restrictions. Unfortunately, the chips seemed to be store-bought, which detracted from the overall flavor experience. Homemade chips would have significantly elevated the dish.

Service: Our server was polite but seemed to lack knowledge about the ingredients and preparation of the dishes. At times, it felt like we were testing his patience.

The only issue was that we wanted to get agua de orchata for someone reason the waiter said it wasn’t good at the moment, didn’t explain really why. Suggested something else but it wasn’t anything similar. The service was not that great. We understood it was busy because it was a festive day but the waiter who had the table behind ours always kept checking up on them and out waiter kept disappearing that we had to ask the other waiter to find him.

My teenage kid can make better pasta.  This is the Taco Bell of Italian food Olive Garden is better!!  And I don’t even go there!  We’ve been to a Buca do Beppo elsewhere and knew what to expect but were happy to see that our expectations were met and exceeded. The food was great, the service was wonderful and we were immersed in American Italian and Italian memorabilia that kept us chatting and puzzling over everything surrounding us. Read more Wow! The once hopping’, loud, energetic, waiting in line restaurant has really changed. When we walked in there was only one other couple seated. It was deathly quiet except for the music playing in the background (and it was not the Italian music we were accustomed to in our many previous visits). Our waiter was nice and attentive throughout our visit. The prices of the food has gone up but so has every other restaurant. The pepperoni pizza was half the size it use to be for $28 and the baked rigatoni was $39. The food was no different than going to the mall at Sbarro’s,… it was average at best.  It’s too bad, I’ve had great memories at these restaurants and it seems to really gone down hill. Read more Great for large groups and parties. Service was great and food was decent enough for the occasion.  However, the restaurant was DIRTY!! The floors and hand rails were horrible and the bathroom needs a deep clean. Place needs a good cleaning and a refresh. Read more The front host staff was very nice.
The manager Tim really works hard and is very knowledgeable about the business. Tim also went above and beyond to give us great services.
The server was great in the start but after we were served our entrees she disappeared for 30+ minutes.
We even had to get our own take out containers.
The restaurant had a very musty odor. It definitely needs an update Read more Was seated at a dirty table. A lil bit of marinera sauce was spilled on the table which I didn't noticed until it smeared on my long sleeve shirt. Other than that food and service was at expected quality(4 stars). Read more Great location, waitress and staff was outstanding!! It’s our s come time at this location…  Great, love having family style dinning here! The food is always amazing!!  We had a great dinner! Food is amazing and staff is awesome! Highly recommend!  Read more Very expensive and hardly anyone there on a Friday night. I see why. It was a fortune and just ok.  Waiter was helpful and friendly.  Quiet night there, but food was delicious and plentiful, as advertised.  No complaints whatsoever.  Go, enjoy, and most likely you will take leftovers home for the next day. Read more Always a great time at Buca!  The atmosphere is terrific and the food is delicious and plentiful.   Huge portions served family style and the menu is varied with something for everyone.  We’ve been going for years and always look forward to our times there.  GREAT for celebrations and big gatherings.  Rather noisy but it’s a fun place so why not! Read more Apple, pecan, Gorgonzola salad was delicious .  The salmon and broccoli is great 👍  We had their Monday Meatball and Spahgetti special--half off.  Pretty good value with some take-home to boot. The regular price of $38 seems over-priced.  Not too many people in the restaurant as football play-offs were on TV. Even with fewer diners, restaurant was under-staffed.  Our waitress did her best though. Read more The restaurant was a huge disappointment.  First, in a nearly empty restaurant (on New Year's Eve), they sat my party of 4 in among two groups with very loud adults and kids.  We could not even talk to each other because of the noise.
Then, we ordered appetizers and wine.  We also ordered a salad.  Of course, they brought it all at once.
I could go on and on.
The food was awful.  It really tasted like they took frozen chicken parmesagn, put it in the microwave for too long, and served it. It was soggy and inedible.
The server did not care (most likely) or was oblivious to the poor quality and bad service.
Do not go to this place.  Ever.  Save your money and go to Dennys.  The quality of the food will be better. Read more Good choice for large parties since the portions are large and family style.  Food and service were very good.  Ambience was a little dead at lunch time though, maybe due to holidays.  We were sat next to two large party so the noise level was crazy. We couldn’t hear each other talk.
There was plenty of tables and other rooms that we could have been sat at. The pastas were full of filler, ricotta cheese. The chicken meal was good. The large salad for five was good but overpriced.

I don’t think we will be returning unfortunately. The restaurants decorated really cute. That’s my favorite part. ￼￼ Read more My wife and I decided to try Bucca for Thanksgiving Dinner. I made a reservation through this app and, few days later, I got a call from the resto to confirm. This is our first time celebrating Thanksgiving at Bucca di Beppo. Their Thanksgiving Menu is a prix fixe, either for 3 or 6 people. Or, one can order from their regular menu, except the pizza. Unfortunately, there is no turkey dinner set for one person. So my wife ordered the menu for 3 people and it was a lot for her! Since I'm not a turkey lover, I ordered a separate dish - Chicken parmigiana with spaghetti marinara sauce. According to wifey, she liked her food, except the stuffings. But with mine, honestly I didn't like it much. The spaghetti was too saucy which made the chicken saggy. Overall, the service is good, the food is oK, the ambiance is fine but too loud, and the price is exorbitant. So, from this experience, sorry to say, ""non tornaremo piú. Arrividerci, Bucca!"" Read more The food was not good and expensive for just simple Italian.  They gave you a ton of food but it was not very tasty.  Read more Would never go back!! Service was poor and food was unacceptable  So much stimulation on the eyes! Great concept dining and feels like you’re at your Italian family’s home in Tuscany. If you’re not Italian- you will feel as though you are!  Beware: each “small” entrée will serve 3-4 people. You’re safe getting an appetizer and dessert and some fun cocktails or mock tails with their variety of flavorful ingredient options. Look forward to going back. Read more The food was very good. (I had salmon and broccoli) The poor waitress also had to do deliveries (she was getting in her car as we arrived.)  So the cook came out of the kitchen to seat us and take our order.  They were both very sweet and accommodating.   Since it is a chain the menu and decor are consistent. Read more Waitress only came around 1 time to ask if we needed refills.

One of the order wasn’t placed  Food was great but the service was non existent.  I had to go down to the bar after we waited 45 mins for our drinks to see them just sitting there and I had to ask a random guy to bring them up to our large table.  We never saw our server again after she took our order.  Not once. We would’ve ordered more drinks if anyone had bothered to come over.  We just paid the bill and left.  Horrible experience overall but the food was good which is the only reason I gave the review 2 stars. Read more Noisy, lots of kids running wild.  Slow service and server didn’t seem to know much about the menu or the birthday dessert.  Absolutely terrible terrible terrible terrible service  We enjoyed their shrimp scampi.

Our server and bartender Mo was fantastic, very personable with great recommendations and fast service  Food is very high quality and with amazing flavors. The fried gnocchi is a must try and the tartare is truly amazing if that’s your thing. Their bread is crusty and crunchy on the outside and soft of the inside.

Server forgot our wine order until we reminded him (after apps delivered), then brought wrong drinks and insisted they were correct when asked why we had the wrong drinks, then charged for incorrect AND correct drinks. Bill was adjusted when asked but wouldn't this be a good time to comp the drinks??

Overall, I would normally give a better review but the noise level was really high. The band in the courtyard was fantastic but because Basta had windows & doors open for ventilation it was loud as all get out to even have a conversation without yelling across the table at our friends. Too bad about this as the food was great as was the waitstaff. I hope Basta works out the noise kinks somehow Read more Cute spot for a casual dinner!

The issue was the back kitchen to table service. Too many gaps between 2 order salad coming out. We were done with one salad before other  show up. Food service out of 5 people none of us recd our food at the same time or together . Two had to start eating before it would get cold while the other 3 still hadn't recd their dinners. When the 3rd person recd the pasta dish it was cold ( Didn't send back because who knew how long it would be, plus two others were still waiting on their dinners)  After 3 were completely done with dinner  the 4th dish came out but still awaiting on one more dish.

Food was good, but I specifically requested outside as I know inside gets loud.

I live  across the street and won’t be returning. Read more The spot was pretty cool. We didn't eat there, we only had drinks. Drinks were ok. Service was great.  Josh and Tori is so great and customer friendly. I would rate Above Ash 10/10 service.  The Roof Top 16th Floor restaurant and bar is really nice.  Views great, large TV's with comfortable seating and great happy hour and specials.  Food all good and the people working there are great - we were helped by Gladys, Jessica and Jose was our server-- AWESOME!! Read more Happy hour is great here!  Carte burger and drafts delicious.

The Carte hotel has exceeded my expectations overall. Read more Everything was amazing. We have come to this place before for drinks only but it look they have  a new menu which has a great selection of everything we will be coming back. Service was great as well. Read more Great server who was very helpful with all of our selections.  Very underwhelming dining experience vs what I experienced in November. My last dining experience was amazing, I raved about the food, ambience and wait staff. This time, I ordered the porcini & chestnut arancini and black tiger shrimp and calamari cavatelli. The arancini was barely warm and the sauce for the cavatelli dish was bland. I ordered this same dish last time and it was an amazing flavor bomb! Maybe the restaurant has a different chef?? I wanted to try a new dessert, but after my main course the waitress came to the table and said.. is this going on your room? It was pretty obvious at that point she didn’t want to be bothered, so I closed out my bill and left. Above Ash has a great bar, nice lounge area and ambience and has the potential to be SO much more, but I get the impression it’s poorly managed. I will give this place another try in the hopes this was just an “off” night. Read more I liked the experience here . It was different and If it was up to me , I’d come every two weeks . The scenery was nice , the host was attentive . I liked it a lot .  Read more Nice spot located above a hotel. 16 floors up. Slow service. Good food. Wish the appetizer would have been out before the meal. Good cocktails even though they took 10-15 minutes. I’d go back to drink for sure. I would go back. Yes. May not be my first choice though Read more Was not very busy for valentines, but service was slow,  food overpriced for quality, very average experience regarding food but the setting is nice  Great place to grab a drink, go on a date, have drinks with friend’s!  It was a bit chilly. Wasn’t aware there weren’t tables there but beautiful view.  Food was cold, the poor service, but Jackie was nice and friendly. Reception and table handler were too busy chitchatting with some lady where I had to go ask for the bill and they took their time to come!!! No hate just honest opinion from experience Read more great food and amazing views! would recommend sitting outside to get best experience  Delicious food, nice atmosphere, Jessica our server was very friendly and provided fabulous service. Manager Raul was very kind to point out points of interest while we were visiting downtown. Read more We really appreciate the service, and we had a great table. Unfortunately, the noise in that restaurant really amplifies with a large party there being excessively loud. The food was very dry and not edible. The waiter was great, however, for 169 dollars for a party of two very pricey. Read more They lost our order so the wait for the dishes was over an hour. Plus the turkey dinners were less then mediocre. They did give us one dish for free because of the long delay.  It was so good, except for the basketball game playing. Don’t care for sports. But it was overall lovely.  Read more We went for a pre-concert prix fixe dinner and everything was amazing!  We had a beer and a nice mezcal cocktail to start.  The menu choices were varied and we chose the Caesar salad, soup, flank steak, and shrimp over polenta.  Everything was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  We had cheesecake for dessert.  Service was excellent, as was the very cool rooftop ambiance.  If we lived in San Diego, we would be regulars here as we loved everything! Read more Not so many views because of construction happening around. Food was great and staff was super friendly!  We were incredibly disappointed.
I always like to try new places, and the photos and menu looked great.

Unfortunately, it was not even close to enjoyable.

Food: I will begin by saying they were not even close to being at 50% capacity - because I am very forgiving of packed restaurants. However, It took over an hour to get our Charcuterie Board (no cooking required). And over another hour for our meal. But usually, the long wait is forgiven once your food comes, but it was only further downhill from there. I have never tasted a more bland, flavorless meal ever. And my guests had the same experience.

Environment: Even at barely 50% capacity, it was deafening. We were all not even speaking to each other because if we were to, we would have to yell, further adding to the loud volume.

Unfortunately, it was just a fail all the way around. Certainly not worth the $80-$100 per person, with two drinks per person, appetizer for the table, and individual meals. Read more Can’t wait to go back. Absolutely amazing in every way.  The venue is nice, the view is great but it's no longer 360. We were seated on the side without a view due to a new building being constructed.

The service was good and the food was great. I gave three stars simply because I booked this for a 60s/70s music experience brunch. There was no music and it was not an""experience."" It is a lovely rooftop hotel restaurant. They should advertise it as that rather than trying to make it sound like something it is not. Read more Our waitress Bernadette is the only reason I didn't give this one star. If you're staying at the hotel, it's OK if you're a local there are better choices.  This is  relatively new establishment, connected with and located on the 16th and top floor of a hotel bldg. Everything is trendy and fashionable. Very nice views of the water and the city. Menu selection was slightly limited but everything was very palate pleasing. I suggest trying the wedge salad, chopped, with shrimp added. Also, sharing the calabrese pizza is a can’t miss. The bar did not have khalua to make my Black Russian but their substitute was more than worthy. So finally, the location of this property is great. It’s on a hill in the Columbia District, which borders Little Italy. It’s quite a contrast if you want something a lot more toned down, modern and chic. Almost forgot, there is also an outdoor lounge with a very large big screen television. A soccer match was playing while we were there. Don’t be confused though, this is not a raucous sports bar. Read more overall it was ok, our server only served the drinks & never seen her after that. the food took a lil awhile it was tasteful but cold lol. we ended up finding someone at the bar to give us the check finally. i wouldn’t recommend. Read more Ashley Taylor our waitress was amazing.  This place is a total vibe.  Very nice ambience in a great place to lounge and have conversations.

Every interaction was a pleasure, from the hotel staff who warmly greeted us as we arrived, to the hostess who seated us, to our fantastic server Brandon, and even the friendly chefs who smiled and thanked us as we left.

The setting is wonderful—sleek decor that is stylish without being overdone. Unfortunately, it was foggy during our visit, so we missed the highly praised ocean view we had heard so much about.

The food was excellent! Our three favorite dishes were the Corn Campanelle, Tuna Crudo, and Potato Rosti & Caviar, and they were absolutely exquisite.

The cocktails, while tasty, felt a bit underwhelming for the price point.

All in all, a five-star experience, and we will definitely be back. I’ve heard their brunch is a must! Read more My husband and I had an absolutely wonderful experience celebrating our anniversary here. The food & drinks were delicious. The service was above & beyond (shout out to Nate!) We look forward to coming back! Read more The restaurant is a largish room with high ceilings and a cement floor — it was WAY too cold.  If I had been there with my wife she would have been really uncomfortable. The restaurant should be kept temperate for its patrons, not the servers and kitchen staff.

Outrageously, this place does not accept cash! It’s bad business anywhere as far as I’m concerned certainly not something one expects to see in an upscale restaurant.  Maybe that flies in a pop-up holiday store or a Wings-N-Things, but mon Dieu. Again, this is purely for the convenience of the business establishment and is a significant inconvenience and a discourtesy to its patrons. Read more Delicious food but limited menu. A LARGE majority of the dishes are made with peanuts or tree nuts. . . So beware if you have any allergies.  Ambiance is outstanding however the food is good but not great. Premium prices for good but not great food. We would not return for the food, there are much better options in North County, but may return for drinks at the bar with ocean views. Read more Staff was wonderful, hostesses, waiters and bartenders all great.  My family took me to Vaga 6 months ago for my 70th birthday.  At that time all 5 us had wonderful meals and the service was excellent.

With that in mind, we made reservations for our 40 wedding anniversary. My wife's trout was very good, the carpaccio was excellent.  The Caesar salad lacked flavor and my entree of the hanger steak was close to being raw vs the medium rare which I ordered.  I would have sent it back however our server must have been very busy as she only came back when we were nearly finished with our meal.  To her credit, she took my entree off the bill without me asking for a concession.

Besides only 50% of our meal  being acceptable we also had an issue with the A/C.  It was freezing in the restaurant and even though we asked them to please adjust the temperature, I believe we were completely ignored.  I know we were not the only people to speak up as we saw them bring blankets to 2 other patrons.

Vaga is not an inexpensive meal so ours and your expectations should be just as high.   Based on yesterday's experience I doubt we'll be going back. Read more Normally, the food is exceptional, but I was really disappointed on this visit. I ordered the Carne Asada omelette, and there was a very small portion of carne asada in the omelette.

The food is divine and they do a great job making substitutions for vegetarians or accommodating different allergies. Always happy with the experience! Read more Nice atmosphere and there was a variety of menu selections to choose from, but the flavor and quality was not there.

The staff are friendly and attentive, and the food has been extraordinary every time I’ve eaten here twice a day for the past 3 days!  Amazing view. Incredible food. Attentive wait staff  Innovative, Latin influenced menu. Attentive service.  Read more This is the second time I've been - once for brunch, once for dinner. Both are just very ok. The food ranges from bad to meh. 

For brunch I've had the crab benedict which were just ok, the Tuna sandwich (sounds interestingly different but its dry and too much of one flavor), the pancakes (good but nothing special), egg sandwich was pretty good, probably the best thing we had but it doesn't make you fall over either.

For dinner, we did not like the shortribs at all (didn't' even taste like shortribs) and the fish special we go was just ok. 

The bartenders are attentive and good, the wait staff not so much.

The view is the best part of the place, otherwise price for value is just not there. Either lower your prices or improve the menu / chef. Read more Salute to the chef!

I had never been to the Fairmont Grand Del Mar so I was totally surprised by the grounds, buildings and interiors. Everything reminded me of the most perfect resort you could dream of finding in Europe. Nothing was spared and the staff was courteous and very well trained. Everyone needs to add it to the must do list while in San Diego. Read more Our experience can be summed up in a single word “blah”. The ambience is completely lacking. Furnishings are worn down (the cushion on my chair was so worn down I sunk into the chair like a toilet ). The table settings were nonexistent (not even tablecloths on the tables.). The menu changes over the past couple years are unsatisfying.  The food was “so-so.” For a $100 a person dinner - a disappointment Read more Our waiter was very aloof and not interested.
There were only a few tables with guests,
Our food was awful - actually my husband and I took one bite and that was it.
1. Hamburger- smash burger?
Very unappealing with a lot of sauce, cold fries.
2. I had butter lettuce salad - there were only
two leaves that were not totally wilted - with strips of limp cucumber added that were also limp.
3. The waiter asked if I wanted to add
“ Protein?”
The chicken came in a side plate/ dry and  cold.

This was a very unfortunate experience.
It’s a beautiful property. Read more I recently dined at Amaya during restaurant week, which featured an appetizer and entrée for $45, with an optional dessert for an additional $9. This was my first visit to the property, and I was struck by the hotel's beautiful ""old money"" charm. The complimentary valet service was a pleasant bonus.

My friend and I were seated outside, enjoying picturesque views of the golf course and the lawn area. However, the service left much to be desired. We waited about 20 minutes before any staff acknowledged us, and we had to request the restaurant week menu as it wasn't provided initially.

For our appetizers, we both opted for the French onion soup, which was flavorful and satisfying. Unfortunately, the entrée was a disappointment. We each ordered the burger, which turned out to be excessively salty and overcooked. Additionally, the presence of pickles on the burger was neither disclosed on the menu nor mentioned by the waiter, which was an issue for me as I don't like pickles. I opted for a side salad with my burger and it was one of the worst salads I have ever had with root lettuce and no other veggies as I expected. I also added the dessert and it was the best thing I had.

Our dining experience stretched over 2.5 hours due to the slow service. On a brighter note, we witnessed a lovely bride and groom's first look at a wedding taking place on the lawn, which added a touch of romance to the afternoon.

After our meal, we strolled around the grounds, which are truly beautiful and well-maintained. The venue also hosts tea parties, adding to its allure.

Overall, while the setting at Amaya is undeniably attractive, the combination of poor service and subpar food doesn't offer good value for money. I am uncertain if I would return. Read more The food was outstanding, but the seating arrangement was definitely awkward : we were 4 and were seated at a round table for 6/8 people! It made it hard to communicate  Amazing wine from Justin especially the Isosceles! Amazing food pairing from Amaya!!  The restaurant week lunch menu I do not recommend. But the environment is beautiful.  Great food and atmosphere. Filet was top notch and the French onion soup  Chef and staff (back of kitchen to wait staff) were fabulous with their service, courtesy and attention to details.  All courses from Starters to Entrees were all presented beautifully with memorable palates. Cocktail and wine pairings were delicious and enjoyable.

Food was subpar but service was great  We have been to Amaya a number of times in the past and really enjoyed it but that was 10 year’s ago. It has changed quite a bit since then and our dinner last nights got was quite disappointing. The restaurant was almost empty, their were no table cloths and no table decor at all accept for a sad votive candle. The food and wine were very over priced and the quality was average at best. Strange to get bbq beans with a pork chop in a French restaurant. I can really see why the restaurant is empty. Read more The menu is ridiculously overpriced.  We have been coming to Amaya for years, mostly for lunch.  But it never seemed so pricey.  Our kids usually eat adult entrees, but because of the prices, they ordered off the kids menu.  We ordered a bottle of wine that was twice the price that we pay at another local restaurant.  We just felt gouged.  No wonder the restaurant was just about empty on a holiday evening. Read more Just wasn’t that impressed. Place is dreary in the evening-all the dark wood, no table cloths, etc. Food was nothing special and the waiter seemed uninspired by his job!! Prices like everywhere these days were not justified by the experience!! I recognize this is the hotel’s B-L and D place but they could make the effort to make dinner a bit more pleasant. Read more Amaya is a beautiful restaurant in a beautiful resort in Del Mar. The ambiance and food at the restaurant is worth the normal price tag in my opinion, but maybe not to go out of your way for.

That said, we went for Valentine's Day where they replaced the normal menu with a coursed preset dinner for $225. This wasn't the best experience and I think that, because they were busy, the service fell off a little bit. I understand that it is appropriate to pace the courses but were there for about 3 hours and twiddling our thumbs for most of that time. The food was good but not mind blowing, which you should expect for the steeper price.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Amaya unless you want to stay at the resort (which is very nice) and check it out while you're there. I can say that the other restaurant at the resort (Addison), which is a lot harder to get reservations to, is very much worth the effort if you're looking for a top-class dining experience. Read more We love the Fairmont and have both stayed here and dined at Amaya. It's just a 3 hour dinner, with very little (and only decent) food for nearly $800 just didn't feel good to me. I've eaten at Amaya before and it was fine. I would just never do any special pre-fixed meals on holidays there again because I just didn't feel the value was there. And I don't mind spending $500 for two if the food, ambience, service, and customer experience is delivered. There are special times for these occasions. But last night, I just didn't experience the value and I believe they can do a lot better. It was a $350 experience at best, not an $800 one.

Supposed caviar appetizer had at best a half teaspoon of caviar, and my medium Wagyu was much closer to well done, not a  hint of pink. Portions were very small and no offering of wine pairing.

I will dine here again…  This is my 3rd Brazilian steakhouse experience and each one was incredible. I love a good meal. The salad bar, grilled cheese and pineapple were my favorites. My favorite meats were the beef, and bacon wrapped selections. Amazing! Read more Fantastic food!  A really fun dining experience!  We will go back.  We had an amazing time wrapping up the week with family at your place. Our second visit, and it was just as impressive! The meat selection was spot-on and perfectly cooked. Portions were ideal, and the side dishes were a perfect match.
Thanks for always delivering a fantastic dining experience! Read more Delicious food and the best service! Highly recommend this restaurant.  The service was good. All very attentive. But all the meat was over cooked. Very bland if any flavor. More expensive than Fogo but not as good quality of food. It was disappointing considering dinner was $75 a person. I wouldn’t recommend restaurant this for a special occasion. It’s average but at a high price point. Read more The BEST Brazilian Restaurant in San Diego! Meat are cooked & seasoned perfectly. Customer service is superb. Salad section choices are fresh & delicious. Highly recommend & will definitely be a loyal customer. Read more My family and I went to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  As soon as we entered we were greeted pleasantly.  The whole staff was very hospitable. Very good experience overall.  Mi esposo y yo fuimos a las 2:30 a almorzar, el servicio fue muy bueno como la vez anterior que visitamos este restsurante. Sin embargo habia una gran diferencia, en el buffet de ensaladas se podia ver claramente que las ensaladas eran los restos del dia anterior ya que las bandejas estaban limpias y solo habia un poco de ensalada de la mitadad de la bandeja hacia a delante y por ejemplo la ensalada de tomate, pepino y queso se veia el tomate y el pepino que no estaban recien cortados estaba aguado, el tomate y mozarella tambien se veia ya seco, como del dia anterior, ensalada de manzana en un pequeño vol, todo en pocas cantidaes y seco. Con repecto a las carnes eran recalentadas, estaban renegridas y bastante secas con lo que el sabor es muy diferente a el de una carne recien echa, el queso asado con miel que nos sirvieron estaba tan recalentado que parecia goma, al masticarlo rechinaban los dientes, todo estaba seco y nada jugoso excepo la piña con miel. Y por supuesto nos cobraron como si nos hubiesen servido comida del dia.  Quedamos muy disgustados ya que la primera vez que fuimos fue por la noche y a pesar de que el restaurante estaba lleno tanto la comida como el servicio fueron muy buenos. Read more It was a great spot.  Amazing service and food. Wasn’t a loud party scene yet had food energy about it.  Good for causal, groups or dates.  Read more I absolutely enjoyed this place! I will be back!!  My husband and I really love this Brazilian Steakhouse.  The food and service are excellent.  Their customer service is wonderful.  They serve a 24 karat gold lines steak which is very unique.  I highly recommend this place. Read more The service was very good and super friendly.  Salad bar was not with many options  5-star experience all around!  We were surprised by the pampering we received from the staff while we enjoyed an incredible meal. My mouth is watering just with the memory 🫶🏼  Kudos to Roger, our primary waiter, who took excellent care of us. All the staff were amazing. And the food was perfection. And OMG!, I must’ve eaten 3 pounds of beef!  The meat was terrible, dry, fatty and overly salted. I’m not sure what’s going on with the quality but it is definitely not the same as it was on past visits. Maybe with the high cost of food they have shifted to buying lower quality meat. Either way it was over 300.00 for my two grandson’s  and  I for a sub par dinner, we will not be going back. Super disappointing as it was a birthday celebration for my 16 year old grandson. Read more Amazing per usual. The recommended cocktail was a lot more bitter than usual, maybe it was the limes. But everything else was great as always.  The service was over the top!  Friendly, engaged staff who truly want you to have a great experience. Unfortunately the main product of a restaurant is the food and that is less than desirable.  Everything has gone cheap and low quality. The selection was poor in the salad bar.  If I wanted picnic food I would go to Golden Corral. The meat tasted great but was filled with lots of chewy material and the fat was excessive.  For $70+ a plate, it is far better to go to an actual Steakhouse. Read more Absolutely Exquisite! We cannot wait to go back! The food, atmosphere, and service are outstanding.  Service and ambience were good. Food was  okay. Shrimp was dried/overcooked. Some meats were too salty. Salad bar wasn't anything special. Hidden prices for items. Not upfront about them. Read more Read more The busier this place is the better they do. And it’s better every time I go.  We enjoyed their wonderful bar menu during happy hour. We sat outside because we had our dog with us.
The food was excellent (you get a lot) as was the service. 

I highly recommend trying out the bar menu. You will go home/ back to your room full and satisfied! Read more Everything was great- only suggestion would be to slow down all of the meat offerings- it was a bit overwhelming having everything come out so quickly  We arrived 15 minutes early for my wife’s birthday and they were able to seat with no problem.  Right away we were greeted by our server.  He invited us to the salad bar and from there it went really fast. (fast in a good way)  Lots of meat choices stopped by our table.  My plate got so full and I forgot to turn my card Red for stop.  The bread cheese was good, but the garlic cheese bread OMG!  Would I revisit yes but for a special occasion as it is quite costly but on the flip side you do get your money’s worth as the cuts and of meat were of high quality. Read more Excellent service and the food was delicious! We’re definitely coming back!  The service was the best of any restaurant. The food was perfectly spiced and cooked. The salad bar had many delicious selections to choose from. The bread rolls served with the meal were fresh and tasty. Compared to the two other Brazilian steakhouses in the area this was by far the best in service and as a bonus there was plenty of available parking. Read more Sodas, juices (including for kids) are not included in the price of the buffet. This place was way too expensive. It’s really good, of course.  This restaurant was amazing!

Everything about this restaurant I like - service is a little slow.  My favorite Roast Beef French Dip was full of gristle (not fat) and uneatable. Had to return it and ordered a salad. Whoever made the sandwich should have seen the poor quality of beef and not served it. Read more Great food and service. We thought it was strange that with only 2 other tables taken at the time, and the fact that we had a reservation, we were taken to a table in the very back near the entrance of the kitchen. Upon request, we were moved to a better table. 

For two salads (one with protein and one without) and two iced teas, $52 is an exorbitant cost. Will reconsider dining here again.

Two of us had the Southwest style salad--one with chicken, the other shrimp-- and the other two had the crab, mango, and avocado salad.

Overall, a great dining option! Read more This is my first time here, and despite getting bad service, I was pleasantly surprised, overall.  it took a while for our waiter to greet us, but when he did, he was friendly and brought our drinks out right away. It was just my mom and I and we  each placed an order for a cup of soup and an entrée. We were waiting forever and tables around us, who were seated after us, were getting their food. We finally flagged down another server and asked if we could get our soup. As soon as she brought out the soup our entrées came out, by someone other than our server. My tacos looked good but they were cold. When our server finally came to check on us we told him that we had to ask for our soup and my tacos were cold. He didn’t apologize but instead just made excuses. He also never refilled my coffee. $4 for one cup of luke warm coffee. The restaurant wasn’t too busy maybe about half full. I will definitely be going again as I did enjoy the ambience, the menu selections, and the food that we did get was very good. Read more It’s such a pleasant and convenient location with good intentions. So much potential.  The food is excellent! its almost a secret hideaway of quiet at the mall!

Bazille is a nice relaxing place to eat. Service was very good. Food was a little too salty for my palate but still enjoyable. The crostini with the salad was too hard for me to bite and a replacement was brought which was a little better. The French fries with the burger was very well seasoned and good. Read more Nice menu selection for lunch.  Outstanding service.  Waiter constantly checked if we  no needed anything during and after our meal.  Nice menu selections, great tasting food, great service.  They were understaffed and it took forever to order drinks and food. The food was very average. We were very disappointed.  Bazille is always amazing in every way!  Our go to place for a delicious and relaxing lunch when shopping at Nordstrom!  ALWAYS delicious foot, every item is a hit and the drinks are great too. I love dining here in between shopping. Service is great too!  We’ve eaten at Bazille many times and never had such a terrible experience.  We ate outside and sat near a table with 5 or 6 uncontrolled kids whose behavior was terrible!  Yelling, moving furniture etc.  We should’ve left!!  The parents did nothing about any of it.  The restaurant was much busier than usual with many kids inside and outside.  The fish and chips was cold and the entire experience was memorably awful! Read more There were only one or two other tables in use while we were there around 6 on a Thursday. Despite the eerily quiet and empty dining room, the food was acceptably priced and pretty good overall. Staff was friendly and accommodating.

Love the waitress Ann and the food was excellent. Never disappoints. Yay  I loved my experience at Bazille! I had the burger and it was amazing!!!! The truffle fries were awesome as well. My only disappointment was the hours that happy hour are offered......  Excellent dining experience - great food and outstanding service..  Food was  ""good "" but a bit overpriced
Service was the WORST--no-one came to our table for 15 minutes--waiters walked by but not one looked at us.  When I told the front desk, a waiter finally came to take our orders.  They did not refill our Tea /water and one waiter asked if ""everything ok"" as he was Walking By!!!--did not even take a moment to stand and give us a moment to answer.  I also told the front desk it was my Daughter's 16th birthday and the waiter was not made aware.  So disappointed--love Nordstrom sit down restaurant but will continue to go to Fashion Valley location--this was terrible experience--so sad. Read more Always excellent !  Love eating at Bazille !

Nothing like it. Great service. I would love more wine options BUT the price of a glass of wine was much better in comparison to other restaurants. We tried another sushi restaurant in La Jolla and wish we had just tried more dishes here! Read more Read more This is a review of a restaurant in its early stages of life, please keep that in mind when taking into account my comments. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was an unused room to the right that looked like a disheveled storage area immediately adjacent to the bar and dining area. The space is relatively small and design is monochromatic with blacks and grays. We sat down at our table and handed menus. The first thing you notice on the menu is the incredibly small print for the descriptions of the appetizers and entrees. The menu selection consists of standard appetizers such as hamachi Crudo to the more unusual such as a salmon baguette, and standard sushi fare such as nigiri and sashimi.  There are entrees as well such as A5 wagyu pesto. There’s also a pasta selection consisting of among other items udon noodles with pesto. Our table mates got it and did not finish the dish. In addition the drinks consists of beer and wine only, and the wine selection is either a Cabernet or Chardonnay by Kendall Jackson.

The service was inconsistent and unenthusiastic as there was only a single server in the space who wore plastic gloves the entire time she worked the floor. The dishes were not coursed out and old dishes were not removed from the table when new dishes came. There was also very little if any explanation of the dishes when presented.

The hamachi Crudo itself was fine if unremarkable, and the sushi consisted of very small thinly sliced portions. For the record I don’t prefer large slices of sushi, but rather sushi that completely covers a modest yet ample portion of rice and folds over the edge of rice. The size was slightly larger than a forefinger with sushi that stopped short of the rice edge.  The sushi was served as is with no accompaniment of herb or spice enhancements. I’m one to let the fish star but this was overly unimaginative and simple.

Overall, Takaramono leaves a lot to be desired if it wants to be an above average sushi restaurant. Read more The food had so much sweet sauce on it and I didn’t like it.  One of the best sushi places in La Jolla. Everything was delicious. Will definitely be back.  We are so excited about this new restaurant on Pearl in La Jolla. The owners are both amazing.

In fact, everyone is treated like they are a special guest. We look forward to going back again soon and often! Read more The food and service was marginal at best…
Limited menu, not what you would expect for a Sushi restaurant.  Soft opening of a new Japanese restaurant in La Jolla. The chef and staff could not be nicer!

I haven’t received terrible service like this in a while. told the waitress I wanted extra salt on my rim for my margarita just to receive a glass with no salt at all. Then, when I mentioned it, she almost bothered that I even asked again. Then I overheard the bartender say who even asks for that much salt anyways. It should be noted that we were in the table right by the bar so I could hear everything. My son ordered plain tacos. I literally said meat and tortilla. Just receive tacos with cheese all over. Once again when I mentioned that the order was incorrect, I received attitude the waiter who brought her food had an attitude. We said thank you several times nobody in the whole facility said you’re welcome. Once she realized that I was getting very upset, she decided to take Margarita off the bill. this was my Mother’s Day lunch so I was very disappointed in the service we received. Had a really nasty attitude. I’m not sure if it was just towards us or just everyone in general.

Given the celebrations I assumed it would be busy and was very happy I booked a reservation earlier that week because the wait line was long. If you have a reservation you can skip the line and go straight to the host stand. The hostess was kind, welcoming, and got us seated right away.

Our waitress was attentive, and brought us waters and complimentary chips and salsa shortly after being seated. She was quick to get our orders in and did great at checking in periodically throughout our lunch.

I ordered the Chicken Tostada Salad and it was delicious. The spicy black bean dip at the bottom really makes it! Would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for a good salad.

My only complaint was how loud the live music was. The artist had a great voice and everything sounded good, it was just very, very loud. We were sitting at an outdoor table right by one of the speakers, so if seated further away from the speakers, you may not notice the sound level as much.

Beautifully remodeled in early 2009, the Brigantine is well-known for the signature Clam Chowder, Grilled Swordfish, and Fish Tacos. The Brigantine is a favorite among locals for consistently fresh seafood, succulent steaks and grilled meats.



Home to the America's Cup until 1995, Shelter Island is still the yachting center of San Diego. The Brigantine offers glimpses of this busy marina from the outdoor patio and semi-private banquet areas.

I’ll be back! Read more Excellent overpriced food, especially the wine. Service was impeccable- overall a great night out. 42 dollars for two glasses of wine not so great. Water for now on.  Good food.  Expensive but good and atmosphere is good too  Food did not taste good, had to send back my entree due to the strange and unpleasant taste.  Waitress was accommodating (credited bill ) and offered something else and free desserts, however, just didn’t want anything else from the restaurant after that experience.  Can’t say I would go back or recommend. Read more Nice evening,  good service and food. Also Padres vs Dodgers playoff game so fun to be there.  The calamari is frozen strips and not freshly cut rings and legs.  Both the swordfish and halibut were way overcooked and dry.

We had dinner, and lobster tacos were recommended, which were delicious. The salmon special was delicious. Our server, Charlotte, recommended it. Good choice.  Charlotte was very attentive.

Our server, Edgar, was so personable.  It was so good that we plan to go back next Tuesday before my friend flies out. Read more Read more The was our 2nd visit to this chain.  The other visit was to the Imperial Beach location.  That visit was fine, but this location was better.  This place had my favorite “crab stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp” on the menu.  Some locations have this, but others do not.  Everything from the drinks to the service to desserts was excellent.  The only improvement would have been a better design if the building so it would have a view of the harbor.  Even though it is next to the water there is no view. Read more I took my in-laws out to eat with my wife and daughter. We had a reservation and was seated at the right time.  They were a little busy, but I've definitely seen it busier than what they were. It took the wait staff forever to come take our drink orders. She apologized for taking so long and said she was really busy, but I kinda watched her, and she just didn't want to be there, in my opinion.  Took just as long to come take our food order. (More of the same all night) I had to flag down wait staff not my wait staff just others passing to ask for refills on iced tea, again for another lemonade for my daughter.  When you spend over $200, you would expect a bit better service. I'm not saying run around like a crazy person. Just check in from time to time, and if the number of tables I saw was too busy for you to keep up, perhaps you're in the wrong industry. Read more service and food were excellent  a bit
Noisy when it got busier after 6:00  The Brigantine Point Loma is a great place to eat!!  Go there if you get a chance.  The food is wonderful and the service is superb.  We had drinks and appetizers. Coconut shrimp were overdone. They were served with ponzu sauce(!!). Crab cake was burnt- overall not very appetizing! The feeling is - we tried once- not again.

Amazing food, great service, very accommodating for our group with young, restless children and easy parking.  The food here was excellent. We all loved our meal.

Bonus for visiting on Sunday is that metered parking was available near the venue and free. We will be back! Read more Live singers and our server were great! The menu is different in person than online however  Asked for a table with shade and space for a stroller for our 5 month old. Have to carry the stroller up some stairs to get in. If there was a more accessible option, it wasn't obvious and no staff let us know when they saw us carrying the stroller back down the stairs.

All umbrellas were placed at the already occupied tables that were in the shade of the building. None were available in the sunny side of the patio, where we were seated.

They did not staff enough for the day (Father's Day). When they did finally get to us, service was pleasant, and the manager jumped in to help with tables. Still had to ask for sugar for coffee and water several times.

Food is overpriced. Tasted decent, but at $20 for a small breakfast burrito, I expect amazing.

This was my second time coming here and i have to say the service this time around was very disappointing, we had to ask for everything, to take our order, drinks took too long (we were sitting right by the bar and it was not busy. there were 5 employees just talking by the bar and not as busy for the wait we had throughout our time there.  had to get up and get someone to get our check no one checked on us we were ready for another bottle however we got tired of having to get someone's attention to help us.

There was also someone at the table next to us smoking a swisher cigar and it was blowing in all our faces. HORRIBLE! Couldn't even say anything about it because we never saw our server.

On the plus, if you sit at any table other than ours, the view is really pretty. The staff meant well, but all the workers from the servers, to the hostesses, to the manager, just are very young and clueless and frankly, unprofessional.

Read more The location is absolutely beautiful, but the restaurant feels very outdated and the menu feels like it hasn’t changed in many years. The entire restaurant was empty by 8:45 PM on a Saturday night. This is definitely more of an early evening and older crowd, sort of place. Read more Excellent ambiance, food and service. Menu was a bit limited  Our service was GREAT!  Wendy & Kevin did an excellent job. The Salmon was amazing.  One of our guests mentioned he would have liked to have licked his plate.  His wife enjoyed the crab cakes.  My wife ordered the Lobster tail.  She said the sauce was tasty, but the lobster didn't taste so good.   It was tough and she had difficulty cutting the meat.  She did say her Ceasar's Salad was excellent.  I also want to mention our Valet person was very courteous and helpful.

Special occasion…asked for window table…got it and a private place…Beatrice(our server) was a sweetheart..very accommodating…food and drinks were excellent…I would highly recommend. Read more The lobster tail was very dissatisfying. Had to use a steak knife to cut it. Advised waiter, who said sorry about that. This is the first time we have had a disappointing dining experience. Usually the food & service are outstanding Read more We had a fabulous time going to the Chart House.  We're locals but haven't been here in a long time.  We took advantage of the three course pre-fixe menu during Restaurant Week (a must do if you missed it this year).  We arrived right on time and had a short wait for our table.  It was nearing sunset and the restaurant was bustling.  We waited in the bar and a waiter took our drink order.  I got the pomegranate martini which had a sugar rim - it was soooo good.  My husband got a beer.  Our table was ready so we took our drinks to our table which had a nice view of the water.  Our server, Ashlynn, was amazing.  Super sweet, friendly, down-to-earth, and attentive.  She had a bus boy bring out warm bread and butter (without an upcharge which is rare these days).  We then ordered our starters; a cup of clam chowder, and the caesar salad (lightly dressed upon request).  Both were excellent.  For dinner, Ashlynn, recommended an amazing pinot noir, Banshee, from Sonoma County.  She brought out a few tasters which I thought was very smart on her part.  We ordered the bottle - it was very smooth with nice notes of berry - perfect for fish or steak.  Our main entrees were the salmon crunch and the sirloin steak. Again, cooked to perfection.  Really enjoyed the ambiance.  For dessert I ordered the panna cotta (chocolate) with sugared tortilla chips (sounds weird but it was excellent).  My husband ordered the chocolate chip cookie with hot chocolate (included).  Such a wonderful meal and experience.  Valet was included but we tipped of course.  Highly recommend to locals and / or visitors. Read more Lovely food as always. Unfortunately, we were sat upstairs (on a very small balcony) with no sea view at all. We have visited many Chart House restaurants but, sadly, this one had the worst view/ambiance for us. Read more The service was great but the hostesses were unorganized.  It seems like folks with reservations were being sat upstairs away from the view which is the purpose for going there.  While people with later reservations or no reservations at all were being sat in prime locations.  We ended up sitting at the bar and the service was great. Read more Waited for our table for 30 minutes.
Service was okay but not crisp.
Wine by the glass served at room temperature. For the price of 25 dollars the wine must be served at proper temp. Major mistake at most restaurants. Expect more from a Tilman  Ferrtitta enterprise. Read more We had a set reservation, made an open table. However, the big heavyset woman in charge of seating told us to wait in the table would be ready shortly.

Our waiter was bartending and serving tables alone. He was amazing and very kind. Really good food and nice outdoor atmosphere.  The food and ambiance are okay. The guy playing the guitar and singing was great. It’s a casual place and a tad loud but really fun if you like to sing along.  Right on the water — great location. It was a Sunday night, so not busy at all. Our server (Chris) was excellent! Salmon was a little overcooked, but still tasty. Brussels Sprouts were some of the best I’ve ever had. Overall pleased with our decision to try it out; we’ll go back again. Read more What a nice surprise!   The food was amazing and the service was outstanding.  We arrived early and had cocktails by the fire pit with beautiful views of the ocean.   The place is a hidden gem!  We will definitely be back soon!

Great place! Read more This place is a hidden gem! Took my wife out for a special evening and this place didn’t disappoint. Bartender Santana is excellent and was able to make it a super special night by just asking why we had stopped by. Then he proceeded to recommend some fabulous appetizers and we sat out by the fire and had the best evening out we had, in a long time! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was spot on! We will definitely be coming back to this place.

Read more This was more like a happy hour social rather than dinner. The bar was overwhelmed. I suppose on a regular night, things would have run smoother. The crispy brussell sprouts were great!  The biggest plus is being near to the water and being able to go for a walk along the cliffs after the meal. Note this is a hotel restaurant designed mainly for those staying at the hotel, so standards are a bit lower than a regular restaurant. Read more It was my boyfriend's birthday next day and we had checked in the hotel to be alot closer to del mar fairgrounds as i had bought good seats fot the circus show volta. The photos of this resto on their website looked nice enough and reserved for a 6pm dinner. Well, we checked in, sat on 2 tables and finally left. There was no hostess except for the bar attendant and she just told us we can sit anywhere. Unfortunately, not alot of options was left and the place wasnt big to begin with. They had 3 corner seats vacant but oddly placed facing the interior. Ive never had dinner like this, like im supposed to be people watching or something. But i suppose the word 'bar' should have given this away. 1 table had 3 business people in it and with the music, sounded fairly loud. Definitely more of a 'bar' vibe once again and not really 'romantic dinner'. The 2nd table we sat on was more typical, where we sat across each other but i dont know if they had blinds..  the left wall was glass facing the sea and at 6pm the world seemed very bright and i felt like we were in the beach sunbathing. The sun literally upset my eye and the idea of eating became unappealing. The menu was limited with only 3 or 4 entrees and the rest of the 2nd page was only wine and liquor. Conclusion:  for a fancier date night, this restaurant wasnt a great pick. Especially at 6pm. Read more Read more This place has a weird parking situation, we had to search for the restaurant, there was only one bartender in charge of all food and drink... for the dining room and the bar.  

Aside from that it was solid.  Food was good, the bartender did the best he could, and we had a pleasant evening. :) Read more No wait at all on Saturday at 5pm. Fast service and good food. Good menu selection. Slightly pricey.  Nice place in a hotel lobby. Bartender was very nice. Not very crowded. Had a mediocre one man lounge singer that was just ok. Overall nice place and very relaxed for right on the coast.  A comfortable and pleasant dining experience was provided by all, from the server, to the chef, and accompanied by a guitar soloist! A perfect evening!  Bartender served good drinks.  And music was good but it was a bad night.  Had a drink and left.  Short of staff.  Bartender was serving the whole bar/restaurant.  Manager was the chef!!  Need I say more ... Read more Bartender managed all Neal service, but was only good at bartending. Although service was very pleasant, We were forgotten more than once.  Oh my God, avoid this place. Only the bartender working Friday dinner service. Both inside and out. Another waiter was cooking the food. A full two hours to get a few appetizers served at the bar. Unbelievably bad performance for and I HG hotel restaurant. Super disappointing. By the way the “ocean view” is barely there. Don’t waste your time or money. Read more A nice quiet alternative to the busier DelMar Restaurants. i had the street tacos which were very good. I also sampled the burger my wife ordered and it was very good.

The waitress acted as though she didn't want to work that night. It took forever to get someone to take our order. I had to signal for a busboy to find our waitress and when she came, she didn't apologize for the wait nor was she friendly. We ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and batter was fried so hard it was eating it. I ordered 5he salmon which was delicious along with the broccolini but the crispy potatoes were soggy. Now good. My husband stated his burger was cold but the fries were good. I made this reservation on Open Table from NC to really enjoy a good meal on the beach for vacation in San Diego. Very disappointing, indeed. Read more It's hard to argue with an oceanside view from a patio table.  We had 4 people in our party.  The drinks were good.  Our 4 different meals ranged from fair to good, but certainly nothing special.  We shared two very skinny pieces of delicious, but ridiculously overpriced cake. The overall experience was nice because of the ocean.  The meal was nothing to make us want to come back again. Read more Very good vibe and the food was good.

Wife sat in it and when I mentioned to hostess, she said “what do you want me to do about it”. I said how about cleaning it. Pretty rude on part of hostess.  The seat was never cleaned so instead had to replace chair on my own. Server on the other hand was nice and friendly. Read more Such a cool place during summer with a nice beach view. Service was 10/10, drinks were really good, and food was tasty.  Fantastic service, good drinks and oceanfront views. I loved taking friends from out of town here for dinner and sunsets.  I have not been to draft for some time but absolutely loved the environment. The patio was fantastic and not too busy for a Friday night. It was great to have the sunset during dinner and got lots of great family photos. 

I have to stop the review and give a major shoutout to our server Zenya. She was absolutely incredible. I was having a friend from out of town meet me for dinner. My family arrived during the reservation but because of traffic my out of town friend was delayed by over 45 minutes. 

My family ordered and the food was great. Then I was able to put in an order for my incoming friend - and get the neighboring table on the patio reserved for my guests when they arrived. 

The food came out perfectly just as my friends arrived. 

All the while Zenya was attentive, helpful, and exceptional with service. 

****SHE IS A 10/10***** What an incredible staff member! 

We will for sure be going back soon and thank you for the incredible food, the views, and the service. 

JG Read more We were very disappointed in our visit there. I made a reservation in advance and asked for outdoor seating..they put us in the bar..the waiter took forever to assist us. We had to ask for silverware and wait for a very long period of time. We got up to get it ourselves. It was very loud so hard to hear people talk. We were there for ""lunch"" at 1:15 but apparently you don't serve lunch until 2:00..very disappointed. I ordered  the avocado toast, which tasted like lime and it being on Rye bread did not help the flavor. the potatoes that came with it were plain with no seasoning and no salt and pepper in sight and the waiter never came back to check on us so I couldn't ask for some. 
I normally like this place but for Fathers Day lunch (which we could not order) was very disappointing.. Read more Read more Draft has a great location on the boardwalk. We sat outside and people watched everyone on the boardwalk along with a great view of the ocean. Friendly service but the food was ok. Not awful but not as great as it has been in the past for us. And a little pricey. I would still go back though:) Read more We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before being greeted and asked for a drink order. When one of our meals “salmon sandwich” came out it was completely raw and uncooked. When we addressed it there was no apology and just a simple “what would you like me to do about it” for the server. There was no awknklegment of the error and it took 15-20 min to get a replacement sandwich at which point pit table was already done eating. Read more Service was slow. A few tables walked out after waiting too long to get service. But, food wasn’t bad.  Overpriced, even for the mission beach area.  Small food menu, nice beer selection. 
Service was friendly.  It was closed for construction when we went!! Why were we able to make a reservation???  Love this place, was excited to hear they were hosting this. Family in Virginia went to a local one there. The welcome hostess staff was exceptional. My one input is the Hot Buttered Rum tasted fantastic. The cup it came in was surprisingly small. 
See you again soon. Read more made reservations for miracle pop up and they sat us in the corner by the patio near the beach side… the whole place was empty at 4 so not sure what was the point of making reservations and then not be able to see near all the decor and bar. Overall just wanted a great experience like other xmas bars i’ve been to this year. Read more Service was good. Food was ok. Seasonal drinks were fine. Ambiance was festive.  We were only given 1hour 15 min and we got kicked out and we still had our food. We had to take our food to go😡. I went for the christmas experience and it was fake advertiseing. We wanted to order more food but given the time they gave us we couldnt. Worst experience ever Read more We were so let down for the Miracle Christmas pop up reservations we had last night. Choosing this Christmas bar over all of the rest turned out to be a huge mistake that we won’t make again next year.
I don’t know if it was just short staffed, but it seemed like there were many employees around. We were greeted 15 mins after seating, which wasn’t horrible. From there service was alright, nothing too bad… but then when our server said she had to leave for the night and cash us out & that she would bring over a new server, she didn’t. No one came by to ANY table around us or us. Everyone was looking around confused. Our table was not done with the evening and we were still waiting on one drink to arrive, the restaurant & bar was not closed and as it had appeared, there were people still working in the bar area, just not in the dining area? Either way, we were forced into a short night and had to leave without even receiving the last drink that was ordered.
Huge disappointment and I hope no one else chooses this place over any other pop up in the area. Read more Read more Did not have as much of a Christmas vibe as I expected. Their holiday bites were sliders, fries, chips and salsa and couple other items nothing that I would consider a holiday bites it was the same stuff you get year round Read more Went for the Miracle pop up, drinks and apps.

The tables that have seats and benches on the opposite side are very awkward heights because they’re so different  Ordered soup and grilled cheese sandwich—both very cold. The place was decorated REALLY well. The lasagna special was liked by my guests.  We went for the miracle at draft and it did not disappoint! Very festive, food was delicious and drinks were great. Would definitely recommend  The Miracle decor was so fun, the holiday drink I got was delicious, and the food was amaaaazing! My husband and I shared the Caesar salad, which was the perfect size for sharing. Then we got the seasonal wagyu lasagna, and the wagyu patty melt - added grilled onions and upgraded to Parmesan truffle fries. I think the fries were my favorite thing of the whole night! We started with some happy hour wine which was delightful and also had the Elfing Around #2 from the miracle menu, and loved it! Everything was fantastic! Read more We went for the Miracle Pop Up bar : while the decorations were a lot and fun I thought there would have been more. Service was friendly, slow at times but overall very good. One of the main reason we went was for the fun drinks! Selection was decent and creative but wow, the drinks were tiny! Now some came in these big character mugs but inside there wasn’t much drink especially for the price. Food was ok, we only ordered a couple things. My son loved the pretzel but my husband wasn’t a fan of the lasagna and it didn’t sit well with him next day. 
All in all, I’m glad we did the experience for a little holiday excitement but not sure I’d go back. Read more Christmas bar was awesome!! Our server was super sweet too and the drinks were great. 10/10 time  Awesome Christmas decor! Great festive cocktails and late night menu.

Food was devine as was the service  The menu for the Grant Grill disappoints. It was a favorite place but now prices are up and the menu items are strange. Chef is trying too hard to be fancy. We suggest eating at the bar where the menu is basic and the prices in line with quality and selection. Plus they need to put away the salt shaker in the kitchen.

Citrus and beet salad was just singing. Still thinking about that one. Grilled octopus was just smoky enough and served with a dollop of sturgeon caviar. Yum!

Read more Chose Fishers because of the “amazing” reviews posted on yelp. Sadly. All of the reviews are incorrect. We arrived earlier then expected and the hostess sat us promptly since restaurant was not full. Drink service was slow but acceptable since our party arrived at different times and we ordered appetizers. Requesting water for the table was a work in progress. When all our party arrived it seemed to be an inconvenience for Gilbert to take our drink orders and food order. Or just check in on the table service. None of the restaurant service staff/ help seemed interested in our table service as well. The food order took 45+ minutes to arrive. How I can state that? There was a soccer game on the tv and I saw the start of the first half and the then watch the players walk off for the half. Unacceptable. When my wife requested service for our table, what I assume to be the manager mystically showed up offering comp drinks and an appetizer of three oysters for the table of seven. Odd. The food arrived cold. Three of the plates. The rest of the table order arrived intermittently and cold as well. If we wanted cold fish plates I would of selected sushi for our family dinner. I would like say the food was good but all our plates were cold. When we departed I saw what assumed was the manager sitting at table with her phone. Service needs to be retrained. Manager fired.

Fishers shrimp was perfect and nicely spicy.  Good Mexican style seafood with good service and a tasty Mezcalito drink.  Will be back again.  The food was incredible and the service was amazing. My family had a great mother's day lunch.  A little overpriced. But over all good enough , the mexican mariscos experience @ San Diego  The manager and staff were attentive and accommodating. The space is beautiful and the food was reasonably priced. We definitely will be going back!  The place was entry and the servers where picking up tables and cleaning which made us uncomfortable because we where not finish ordering  We love Fishers. The food is always excellent and the staff is very competent. I highly recommend trying the restaurant.  Some restaurants serve food. Fisher's serves flavor. Every dish was bursting with flavor and I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. A friend and I shared 2 of the appetizers they recommended and one main.  Next time I think we will order more share plates. By the way, they have a wonderful cocktail menu as well. I can't speak about hte indoor noise level as we sat outside on the patio.

Be back!  Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Had dinner first time and returned the following week for lunch.  Great food from talla fish to mexcalita drinks.  Will definitely be coming back.  Food was amazing.  Very fresh ingredients and terrific selections.  The owner Nino was very welcoming.  We will definitely return!  We'd never been to Fisher's before and we'll definitely go back.  The food was really good.  The service was super-attentive.  And it had that ""neighborhood"" feel that so many places lack.  The owner of Fisher's was in evidence and went from table to table welcoming his guests and making sure they felt well taken care of.  I'd definitely recommend Fishers to others. Read more Super friendly staff, excellent service. Food was amazing-
We had a variety of dishes including ceviche, sea bass, salmon and all were fantastic.  Thanks for a lovely evening.  Service and food are excellent. I can’t get enough of their breakfast/lunch menu - specifically their huevos cazuela and the spicy tuna quesadilla. Both have tuna perfectly seasoned by axiote/achiote.

Read more Limited menu for a Friday evening, but patio was delightful.  Nice ambiance and wonderful light music on Friday.  limited menu. very limited. I actually was going to order to go prior to the patio event they have on Friday. Which means I would have to order 2 dinners to go and drinks on patio. 30 min prior. Absolutely no and tried prior to event change. The worst was CYA with host and then approached Managers and they all changed up time cut off. Management company should know. It was basically what fit their schedule on Holiday weekend Labor Day. Same smell in the past. Read more This is strictly a complaint about the service: We happened to catch the restaurant at a busy time during their Sunday Brunch, and apparently, they were short staffed as well. The problems began when the cup of coffee I ordered was obviously old and burned. Ick. Then my hot breakfast was served along with one of the two salad orders and the other order was not included. After 5 minutes or so we flagged down our waiter and asked where the other salad was and were told that it was ""on its way and be patient."" But it did not come. I waited to start my breakfast so by then it was cold. Finally, our waiter came by and told us the other salad had been delivered to another table (oops) and they were working on another one now. I asked our waiter to reheat my breakfast and bring it with the other salad, which he did with some eyeball rolling. Once everything arrived, I realized that the ""extra crispy"" bacon I ordered was not crispy as all but a soggy limp mess, so I asked for crispy bacon instead and that got more eyeball rolling. But once we all had what we ordered the meal itself was fine. It was enjoyable to sit on the patio and it is a nice view. Our waiter did not come back to ask us how our meal was, never offered me more coffee (which I would have refused anyway) but eventually brought us the bill and told us he was going on his break.  From my point of view, busy is not an excuse to screw up our meal, it just means you try a little harder. The kitchen may have been busy, but our waiter missed too many opportunities to avoid all the other problems. I'm sorry to say it was an unpleasant experience.

Across of the Grant Hotel - on the corner of 4th Street and Broadway","Read more Open Table driving directions had the wrong coordinates and sent us to the wrong address. This occurred using both Apple and Google Maps. When we inputted the address instead of relying on OpenTable, we were able to get to the restaurant. While in the restaurant we tested our theory by clicking the OpenTable directions and the directions said we were 3 minutes away while we were sitting in the restaurant. Read more Great location, food and service. This a secret gem.  Service was superb.  One dish was very garlicky.  Other 3 dishes were good.  Bread basket was worth the $5  This place was absolutely outstanding. Maybe the best ceviche ever    Service was great. Food was great.  ￼The calamari and manhattan cocktail were awesome.  I ordered what were advertised as jumbo crab legs.  They were not.  They were the size served on a buffet.  Not very pleased.  The Chardonnay selection was not food—Crane lake which runs $3.99 per bottle.  The churros and ice cream for dessert were previously frozen, not fresh.  Pretty disappointing for a $275.00 dinner for two.  On the positive, our female server was very good. Read more Crab cake appetizer more filler than crab…arrived cold.

Read more Read more The staff was was great - both the hostess and our server were very cheerful and helpful. The inside of the restaurant had a stench that made it unbearable to eat inside. Outside was pleasant however the neighborhood isnt the best so there was a constant cast of characters wandering by. The food was severely overpriced for the taste and quality. As out of towners, we relied on the menu and pricing to surmise this was a fancier restaurant. Boy, were we wrong! Read more Possibly at end of night our crab did not seem that fresh. Service was good and clam chowder and my wife’s lobster was very good but the king crab was a bit disappointing for the cost,  Was lectured about social issues by the server.

Not crowded and on a busy holiday weekend.
Would return for more! Read more I had been to this restaurant about a year ago and wondered why I hadn't returned., now I recall.  I called to see if they had Salmon on the menu and they said they did.  We got to the restaurant early, 5:45 on a Saturday and they tell us they were OUT of Salmon, really???  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and when it arrived the glass was so small, it was really a half glass.  My fiancee' ordered a Cadillac margarita, and was given a regular margarita.  The waiter, was great, friendly and tried to be accommodating, but the way food was lacking.  I ordered the brussel sprouts, but asked if they would hold the bacon.  They said they could not as they were mixed in with the sauce.  I had to removed about 3 tablespoons of greasy bacon.  We won't be going back.  Very disappointing.

The hostess was completely indifferent and made us wait 15 minutes when there were many empty tables. The food itself was average  It was overall good. The service was a little above average as was the food. I only give five stars to places who are truly exceptional. This place was pretty good. I would eat there again.

.  Love the location right in the Grand Hyatt with views of the water. They have indoor and outdoor seating. One of the best Denver omelettes of my life! Great buffet breakfast with so many options including fresh honey comb which was really unique and tasty! Read more Nice brunch buffet.  Good food selection to include fresh fruit, good breakfast meats, and a well stocked omlette bar.  Great food and service ! It was my boy's birthday and they made it special  The Seaview Cafe is located inside the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego.  They offer a buffet breakfast that reminds you of the kind offered at Hilton Gardens or Embassy Suites, but much much better.  The ambiance is quiet and relaxed, with tables and half booth/half table set up.  In the larger portion of the dining room, views of the harbor area, Seaport Village, and the ocean can be seen.  There are two stations where you can get your food.  The first is a cooked to order area, where you will find waffles, avocado toast (so good), and order an omelette tailored to your tastes.  My husband had an omelette the second time we dined there and said he wished he had done this on our first day there as it was far superior to the scrambled eggs on the hot station.  I had avocado toast on our second dining visit and had the same reaction, far superior to the bagel I toasted the day before.  Served on multi grain bread, you can choose either an avocado shmear with micro-greens on top or the same but with bacon on top of the avocado and topped with micro-greens.  I chose the second option and the saltiness of the bacon combined with the avocado, so good.  The second station has a variety of options:  hot (sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict (this rotated out with a Bao bun with a Jalepeno hollandaise on our second visit), roasted potatoes, and pancakes; cold area (cottage cheese, yogurt, pineapple, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, smoked salmon, cheese, prosciutto, and salami; next area was the bakery (mini muffins, English muffins, bagels, muffins); and finally a cereal area with both healthy and sugared options.  There is also a basket of apples and bananas, we grabbed a few and for snacks as we opted to make this a big meal and not eat our next big meal until dinner.  Service is excellent, the wait staff was so courteous.  We made a reservation, but come in before 8 AM on a weekdays and there are tables. Read more Overwhelmed staff, food of average quality, food ran out, cook using bare hands on waffle maker  Excellent selection of brunch items including gluten free; eggs and omelets to order; great ambience  Great Breaksfast options.

Read more Thought there was an option to order off menu vs buffet only. Food was ok, not great.  The people at Seaview CANNOT be NICER!! And they are so attentive!! The food selections are so good!  I had the made to order Omelette the first day and had the Strawberry Yogurt today with a variety of granola and fruit add ons!! Delicious both days!! Looking forward to going back tomorrow!!! Read more Thank you experience was excellent service was amazing will use this app again to book reservations to restaurants  Location is convenient for hotel guests. Some of the food was very good; though the omelet was mediocre at best (cheese wasn’t melted, too oily, little seasoning). Few vegetarian protein options. Overall a glorified continental breakfast with an omelet station. Plus, the name “Seaview” is a bit misleading, as one gets an angled view of boats in the marina. “Limited Bay View” would be more accurate. For $45, I do not recommend this for breakfast unless time is limit-as it was in my case. Also, for the price of the room, would offer a discount to guests…as there really isn’t an alternative on site. Really too bad, cause the hotel is excellent. Service was good though. Walk a few blocks and get breakfast in Gaslamp or at an adjacent hotel. Read more Too many people, long lines. Cold food, no carving station. Huge line for omelette station, 1 person who was overwhelmed. Average at best. 
After all the extra fees that they add $100.00 for 2 people! 
Roof was leaking. 
Very disappointing. Read more The bottomless mimosa were definitely worth the price! Great breakfast options as well!  Beautiful & Great Food!

They had a special table ready for us with a beautiful anniversary dessert waiting for us. Everyone said happy anniversary and made our morning so special. Thank you! Read more The service was horrible. We waited over an hour to get our food. The waiter wasted coffee on the table and just walked off. I called him by name (Alex), and he just kept walking. Mateo spent most of his time away from the table. He didn't  take the menus away after we ordered our meals. There were seven of us, and we were charged a gratuity of 18% of our bill.

Thank you  Standard buffet experience in a 4-star hotel. Nothing special about the food variety or quality but no complaints either. Seaview name is a bit misleading because seating is almost all in doors with no view and outdoor seating really doesn’t have a view either. Read more Never disappointed at the Seaview. Always when in San Diego  Wonderful service. Hosts and servers were/are amazing! Will definitely be returning.  Great view. Awesome tasting food. Service was superb. Def eat here again!  Very busy but restaurant coped ok with continuous guests arriving.  Mediocre food and selection of options. Cost does not justify the abysmal lack of variety. The ambiance is bland, uninviting, and gloomy. The decor is reminiscent of a 1990’s senior center dining hall. Would not recommend for the price. Bizarrely overpriced and overrated. San Diego has far more exciting and appetizing spots for breakfast. Save your money. Read more The food selection covers all the basics but I wish they can step up the pastry section and chia seed related items.

There were times where our table only received one single dish at a time for the four of us to split and we then had to wait several minutes before the other dishes followed sitting in awkward silence.

Diffinitely a 5 star restaurant!  Great menu, great atmosphere and great service! Highly recommend you giving Vintana a try. After finishing our popover with honey jalapeño (i think) butter and the large enough wedge salad to split, I barely had enough room for my entree! I’m definitely a fan 😊 Read more We had a wonderful meal. We ordered  short rib and tuna entree. Lobster bisque was fabulous. Our server was attentive and kind. They brought out an nice dessert for my friends birthday.  Superb service and delicious food.  Will be back again soon!  What an incredible restaurant! The staff are very attentive and get an A+ rating. The food was quite memorable and delicious. What a wonderful environment for relaxed dining.  Service was great, and we loved the atmosphere.   There were a few food highlights, but overall, the food was mediocre.  The fillet was good, the fries were some of the best we've ever had, and the brie appetizer was exceptional.   However, the calamari was drowned under an overly sweet sauce that made it soggy and clump together.  The creamed spinach was over spiced with nutmeg - you should taste the hint of nutmeg. It shouldn't be the predominant flavor.  I tried the Japanese veggie plate which was very disappointing - the sweet potato was so over fried i couldn't bite into it, the tempura veggies were soggy under the curry sauce and the ponzu cabbage turned out to be a slaw.  I'd avoid this dish altogether.

For a high-end restaurant,  Vintana provides a mixed experience.   On the one hand, they have the service, atmosphere, and pricing of a great restaurant.  Now, if they offered consistently great food, it would be worth it.   But there are so many choices if you're looking for a great restaurant. Unfortunately, Vintana isn't one of them. Read more Overall great service and food! James did an exceptional job!  We enjoyed a lovely birthday celebration at Vintana's on a Friday night. The food was delicious, but I would have appreciated more vegetarian/pescatarian options. The service was outstanding and the patio was a beautiful atmosphere.

I would definitely  recommend for others and return myself for another special occasion, or even stopping by for appetizers and drinks sometime. Read more Great service and best happy hour! We will be back!  Wish we had asked for table not so close to service area with nicer view.   William was our main server and he made us feel very special with his polite and professional nature.

The Brie appetizer was excellent, and we split the wedge salad. It was excellent too and good sized portions.

First off, our server Ciara was fabulous. Her upbeat personality and attention to details was impeccable. The support staff that assisted her with water refills, clearing plates, etc.were also great. It was my friends birthday lunch and they went out of their way to make her feel celebrated. We shared a large serving of the calamari for an appetizer and it was great. They used the rings which were breaded just right. I don’t like large flat pieces of calamari so I was so happy they used rings. My ahi salad was incredible and HUGE with the ahi seared perfectly. My friend had the carbonara pasta which she liked. As usual the interior design, etc. is relaxing and the large windows add to the outside views. Love Vintana!

Read more My wife and were in mood for some good for dinner and of course we thought of Vintana. We ordered the specials of the day the food was delicious and right on time with a great service.  Food was good. Only issue was the waiter sold me on a glass of Pinot noir and then charged me $34 for 1 glass. Absurd. I was just in Spain and was paying less than that for an entire bottle. I wouldn’t have minded so much if the glass of wine were excellent. It was just okay. Felt ripped off. Won’t be returning soon. If you are going to push wine, do it with a small price list so people are not shocked when they get the bill. This is definitely an example of price gouging.

Will definitely be coming in again!  I had the worst birthday dinner at the Bj’s in La Jolla, first off I got there at 6:35 pm after one of my guest so they had already been seated at 6:30pm. So when I got to the front I asked the hostess where my table was and she told me I could look around. Then the waiter we had decide to throw the coasters on the table like she was in a track and field meet for discus. Then we ordered our food which took extremely long ... we received our appetizers and food at the same time. My guest also didn’t receive the drinks they initially asked for so we had to ask several times to which we were told just give me a minute I have to do “_”. We watched as other tables were served in a timely manner all around us. We all ordered deserts but I was give a birthday pizookie which was room temperature at best as were my guest desserts. When we were ready for our ticket the waiter told us she would get it 15 minutes pass then 30 minutes and still no check. We had to ask several different waiters if they could just take our checks because at this point it was 9:15 pm! I had other events I wanted to go to on my birthday but could not because I was waiting on my water for unprecedented amounts of time at a restaurant. Our drinks weren’t refilled unless we stopped another waiter to tell our waiter. Overall worse experience of my life at an establishment. I would hate to think that this was because of my guest and I’s race but I had been to this location before with a less ethnic group and did not experience any of this before. I am a student at UCSD and it troubles me that I can no longer attend a delicious restaurant within proximity to my residence. I have asked other minorities about their experiences and sadly they have shared similar instances. I hope the company does not make a habit of making minorities feel uncomfortable in their establishments. My friends and I will take our business else where from here on out.

We had contact with our server 3 times total,  The water filler came by 3 times also.  Adequate service, nothing more, in a restaurant that was mostly empty at the time, it seemed lacking.

My family and I ate here for dinner and we all enjoyed our meals. All the servers were kind and attentive. We will be back for sure!  Went for Mothers Day brunch. To charge $95 per person and not include mimosas is criminal. Also there were no Eggs Benedict, Waffles, French Toast, Ice Cream, Ceviche, a Chicken entree, and the only option for any kind of egg dish was to stand in line to have it made instead of having a chaffing dish with scrambled eggs while other food on your plate would get cold.

It was not.  Not a large variety of foods to choose from.

We were a party of 6 and they included an 18% gratuity and a 5% surcharge then ended up taxing us on both those items so actually overcharged us on this mediocre brunch.  I will say the service was great.  That was the only good part. Read more the food quality for the price was severely lacking, disappointed in that and the table organization.

I ordered the calamari to start, I would definitely like more calamari with my fried breading (first disappointment). My significant other ordered the 12oz lobster tail. Lobster was over cooked and came out laying on cold scalloped potatoes??? The truffle Mac that was supposed to accompany the entree came out late and was also cold. (Second disappointment) I ordered the 14oz Prime rib. I have never ever had a dry prime rib, it was the exact opposite of how Chip described it. Dry, tasteless and just not cooked properly. Best part of the whole experience was probably the mixed drinks. I would not recommend this place for quality of food.

Great appetizers and homemade pasta. 50% off select bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. And the cannoli was amazing! Great service. We will go again.  We ordered the entree that was a table side pasta prepared in a cheese wheel. There was no fanfare in this presentation. The cheese wheel was on a tall cart so you couldn’t  even see the prep unless you stood up.  The pasta was room temperature.  The eggplant parmesan was soupy, oily and served in a bowl with no pasta. The garlic bread and complementary birthday lemon dessert was very good, and our server was a delightful young lady. Read more Amazing waiters. Amazing food. Overall an amazing experience!

Thank you for a relaxing Saturday on the patio watching the planes.  Made reservations for my birthday to enjoy some nice calm time with my friend and stay out of the exhausting heat. However, to my surprise, we were sat at the rooftop with the scorching heat and the service did not seem to exist. It took a while for someone to take our order. By the time we were able to order, we were all drowning in our sweat, and then we asked to be moved indoors and it did not seem to be of any better. It was still excruciatingly hot and on top of that, the food that was ordered never made it to the kitchen. My friends and I waited a whole 1.5 hours to find out that our food was never submitted to the kitchen for prep. 
I have never had a more disappointing, unwelcoming service, and I have spent time at a winery in my entire life. My entire group honestly felt ignored most of the time. It was truly a disappointment. I wanted to like this winery, but I now have other thoughts, unfortunately. Read more Service was poor at this location. Both servers had bad attitudes. Wine is great.

A+++  Always amazing, fresh sushi in a wonderful setting. More on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for and SI is some of the best traditional sushi in North county.  Understaffed and undervalued. Difficult to find from the parking lot.  Food is ok, but value is not fair compared to the price, service is ok, but could be better compared to similar restaurants.

The food was very good!  The service was very good.  Excellent quality sushi made in a more traditional Japanese style and not terribly Americanized. Rolls are simple and not drenched in sauces. Sashimi appetizers are excellent. With all the influx of sushi places in San Diego, this is one of the most underrated in my opinion. Read more The fish was very fresh and there was a large variety of offerings.  Disappointing. Dismissive service and lack of hygiene  This was my 2nd visit in 2 weeks and with both visits the host and server, Yoko, was rude. She rushed us out both times before we were ready to go. We asked to stay a few more minutes, but she said no. She didn't care and even though, there were many open tables with no one waiting, she didn't care about our visit. She was the most disrespectful person I have ever experienced. I will never go back and will gladly share my experience with whoever will listen. Customers should never experience such disrespect.

Horrible horrible rude service.. acting like you dont soeak english well to weasel out of doing your job… fodd was barely above avg so all in all… def dont go here with a reservation 30 before they close..& the sushi isnt great so i would hesitate to recommend it when there are plenty of other sushi spots that appreciate business and have manners… Read more Exceptional sushi.

Very nice ambience on the patio and a distant view of the ocean. The only odd thing is that we had dinner reservations at 7:00 pm and we had to quickly order after the starters and drinks because the restaurant closes at 8:00 pm. Highly recommend. Read more It was a dining pleasure from friendly arrival, professional service & excellent food from a very courteous & knowledgeable staff.  I did not feel welcome here. Food was fine. Very pricey. We had a reservation, we were on time. They made us feel we were lucky to be served there.  The sushi rolls just weren’t as good as other good sushi places around our area  This is my third time eating here and have decided not to go back Shimbashi again for now.  The gentleman server and other staff just didn't seem very friendly and enthusiastic about recommending dishes, different sake types, or in general being cordial.  They accused me of ordering quantities that they misheard (4 orders of nigiri yellowtail instead of 4 pieces), they asked me twice to clarify orders while swinging by the table and interrupting my conversation, and in general the fish freshness, portions, and presentations were average.  There are much better sushi restaurants, such as Ken's Sushi Workshop (Carmel Valley), Blue Ocean Robata (Carlsbad), and even Suki Hana (UTC). Read more Our favorite Japanese restaurant in town!
Tonight, as always, terrific food and thoughtful service  We have been going here for a number of years and the food is always great. However, this time, the service was not as great. The server dropped a bunch of liquid on my phone, in my sake glass and on the table while clearing the plates. That by itself is a not a big deal as these things can happen. However, no offer was made to clean my phone, or even the table! I had to ask and I was given some paper towels to clean it myself. I then had to ask for a fresh sake glass - the server said nothing! I dont know if the restaurant does not train new folks adequately on how to respond if they made a mistake but it did kind of bring the experience down a notch.

Our server took our orders and never came back. Our appetizer took over an hour and half to get to our table. We finally had to say something to get our main course. They served my dessert and it was missing the churro. When I told my server that the churro was missing she replied, ""oh sorry, we're out of churros"" then proceeded to walk away without offering a different dessert. My appetizer portion was so scant.

Place was a bit quirky but still a good time.  I came to San Diego for a “working vacation” and was told that this place was THE place to come for Sunday Brunch. Boy, was my colleague spot on. Everything—and I mean everything—was delicious. From the hand-poured bottomless mimosas to the pancakes to the Eggs Benedict, we were treated to amazing food in a fun atmosphere.

Was pleasant, but tables were too close together. Server was perfect though!  Horrible food and they were beyond slow. Took 90 mins to get food, 30 mins to get food.  Great experience at restaurant week.  Ate outdoors.  Live music started at 6:30pm.  Had the lamb chops...so good.  Delicious Chilean salmon and caprese salad. Great piano player  First of all what comes out of the kitchen was delicious. We were seated early and the staff needed prompting to offer us drinks. They were focus on the outdoor crowd and we had reservations and were inside. We seemed to be invisible. After the initial drink order things improved and we ordered from the fixed price three course offerings. The lamb chops, lobster ravioli, gnocchi and spare ribs were delicious. The polenta on the lamb not flavorful but the grilled lamb wonderful. 
Our greatest complaint was the confusion on the waiter staff. Our waiter Kevin performed his task well but those supporting him seemed confused about clearing plates before next course, fresh forks, water refill all the details that go with a lovely meal. Twice items were brought to our table that were not ours, they looked so good it was tempting to say leave them. So the real opportunity for this establishment is training of staff if they want to offer fine dining. The kitchen has it figured out. Read more Great lamb chops & tiramisu!!

We wanted to go to little Italy for Italian but decided to stay downtown. The restaurant’s decor was very nice.  However, there was a piano player that was too loud and made the mood of the restaurant confusing with her set playing the most random songs as we tried to relax and enjoy.  The food was okay, but I expected more for the money. Read more Read more Service was very slow and non-chalant about everything. Drinks took 20 minutes to arrive... On a slow night with only a few tables seated. 
Food was inconsistent,  and mostly mediocre at best. Rigatoni bolognese was not good, and not hot. Lobster ravioli was only ok. Shrimp scampi didn't look or taste like any shrimp scampi I've ever had... and not in a good way. Caesar salad was meh. The meatballs we had on the side were the best tasting food item, but were served lukewarm.  Garlic bread service was the 2nd best thing, and were the hottest food we were served. Cocktails were only ok. My daughter didn't like the Black Widow cocktail. Very sour.

Overall, for the price we paid for our reality was definitely not worth it. Sorry to leave a bad review, but it is what it is. As far as the stellar recent Yelp reviews (Aug 2024) go...all I can say is that it's either been fabricated or the people that ate there were starving and/or had no working taste buds.

It was a terrible experience would never go back. Read more A great way experience
The food is good but excellent and the service superior
But the music with Iris Mone was the BEST !  The best Italian food I’ve had in San Diego!  Lamb lollipop chops, fettuccine and Spaghetti (not on menu) were amazing.  Entertainment was really professional too.  Food exceeded our expectations, service was great, & the live music makes the experience that much better! Would definitely come back and recommend to anyone in the area!  Waitress forgot our salad. She didn’t even realize. Our meals were delivered 5 minutes apart. My seafood was cold by the time our 3rd guest received his food.
The house wine was rancid, we sent it back, said she would take it off the bill. Instead she changed me for a Frank Family Merlot @ $20.-/glass, which I never even ordered. The bread : Garlic nots were burnt and hard, not worth the $18.- for bread. Read more Read more We had a great dinner Saturday evening outside on the patio.

Excellent mushroom ravioli and
blue cheese bacon wedge.
And the live music on Thursday is like the enjoying the highest caliber singer in Vegas
but a more intimate setting.
And the jazz trio on Saturday is world class.
Highly recommend both nights. DMR Read more I wanted to like this place, but the food left me wishing for higher quality.  Food was just ok, nothing that really blew me away.  We had the lobster arancini, which were a bit over fried.  The Caprese Salad was just ok, could have used more pesto or even a bit of fresh basil in there as well.  The Mushroom Ravioli were definitely the star of the evening.  

The waitress was helpful even if somewhat lacking in attentiveness.  We waited a long time for our food.  Although it was a very busy night with the concert happening at Petco.  I can't say I would go there again, but it was a decent meal before the show. Read more The food was flavorless and cardboard like.

It was a weekday night they weren’t busy but the four of us felt rushed by staff. Still having our salads when they brought our entrees. Seafood special salty.  Outstanding service and great menu food and vino!!  They’re gluten-free options are out of this world!

I made a reservation for my wife’s 50th bday and we only saw our waiter two times: to take our order and hurry us out the door. 
Waited at the table for a long time before we gave our order, had to ask for water refills, no bread was offered, dirty plates were left on our table from our salad while we ate, had to ask multiple times for Parmesan cheese and no birthday gestures or cake.

The eggplant parm with marinara was very good. All portions were very large. Each Could have easily been shared, salads too were large. Service was a bit lackluster, the staff that brought our meals said she’d come back with Parmesan cheese but never returned. Not a huge issue as our waiter eventually brought some for the table. We were given another tables check which had to be voided and then we were given the correct check. A bit noisy but to be expected when the restaurant was totally occupied.

Pizza and ravioli were exceptional.  I hadn't been to Buona Forchetta for 12 months or so.  Pleased to report the food, service and pricing is very good.  I have only two suggestions for improvement.  I stress these are quite minor:  (1) don't bother with the bread/oil served prior to ordering.  The bread is quite ordinary and doesn't set the correct tone for the rest of the meal.  (2) Seems strange to say this, but reduce size of entrees.

I ordered tacos to be safe. The “spicy” chicken tacos was just grilled chicken with little favor. My plate came with rice and beans which was white rice with black beans on top…once again with no flavor. The margarita was good but everything else was bland and way overpriced.

Our other experiences were much better.  We had tickets to a play in the park across the street.  So time was of the essence and we left plenty of it.  The restaurant was busy.  Our server, “Ian” was excellent and we got out timely.  I ordered a Chicken Tamale.  It was “fair”.  My friend ordered the same thing and had the same impression.  The masa was just mushy in part and dry in others.  The most irritating aspect was the this small space had live music which was not only too damn loud, but, the singer could not carry a tune.

I can't believe as much as I'm in the Banker's Hill are I've never stopped in at Barrio Star.  I now regret it and I'll be coming back.  I loved the margarita selection, new and different for me.  The dishes I picked were delicious.  The Barrio Pepinos so good, in fact, with it's cumin vinaigrette, I had to order a container to bring home.  I'm kinda picky with my Chile Rellenos, spoiled by having such outstanding ones in New Mexico that I don't hole San Diego version in super high regard.  Well that changed, the preparation was spot on, but for not being fried, lol.  It was plated atop Mexican rice pilaf, dressed with chile guajillo sauce, tomatillo sauce, cilantro lime sauce and topped with Cotija ranch, holy moley. Read more Read more Barrio Star was great and a great margarita!! Highly recommend  If you're looking for a place to drink, apparently this is it, especially the margaritas we kept seeing go out to almost every table. If you want good food, this is not the place for that. Ceviche, how can you mess that up? By covering it with ketchup like this restaurant does, inedible. How can you mess up potato tacos? It's literally fried potatoes with cheese and lettuce, well again coving them in ketchup and serving soggy potatoes, again inedible. Won't be back as I don't drink so our server was subpar and ignored us since we only drank water, it was 3pm and 86° outside. Read more Our waiter was very attentive and made excellent suggestions. I loved the Brazil Bowl and the Coconut Pineapple Margarita.  Great location on 5th with indoor and outdoor tables.  We sat outside, it wasn't busy  and they quickly forgot we were there.

Unfortunately our service was extremely slow. While not packed, we had to wait 20 minutes for a server to come to our table — and only after we asked. One of us ordered a drink that didn’t come with the server the next two times he came to the table. It took 2 reminders after the order for us to get that drink.

Calories afterwards.  Parking busy due to a conference.  Overall the food was good though some dishes were fives and one was two.

It was a long wait before a server came to take our order. We ordered our drink appetizer and dinner all the same time because our time was a little bit limited. We received our appetizer and it wasn’t until finished our appetizer that the drinks (wine) were actually brought to the table. The food was excellent, but the service was the worst I’ve seen in a long time. It looked like there was only one server serving 5 tables. I was without water and no server in site for most of the meal. I might come back for the ribeye which was excellent, but not sure I want to endure the wait.   Since there were a lot of hard surfaces in there,It was very loud even with only five tables being filled. Live music was too loud and too upbeat for dinner.

What we thought we ordered would be good, turned out to be quite different. The nachos were totally different than normal nachos I’m used to. 
The family Caesar salad was a shock to us. Long Romaine lettuce leaves sprinkled with cheese and dressing with a long crouton on top.
Half the table ordered from the kid’s menu since the regular menu didn’t appease them.

The staff was preparing the dining room for breakfast around us.  Nobody greeted us.  The water tasted like chlorine.  Our server did not present as trained and was flustered even though there were only two other tables with guests in the entire dining room.  The food was acceptable, but service was terrible.  I would recommend not eating at Rumorosa.  Take an Uber into Little Italy or the Gaslamp instead.  Very disappointing experience and very expensive.

We had a dinner before Padres game and we really enjoyed it. Everything we ordered were delicious and service was very fast despite the fact that the place was pretty busy at that time.

The bar area looks fun so maybe next time! Read more The carnitas here are the best I have ever had!  Fantastic.  Tacos were delicious! Great ambiance, service was also great!  I’ve enjoyed my visits to Blind Burro, and the food is consistently good. However, I believe the tacos could use a bit more meat, especially considering the price. The meat itself is delicious, but there isn’t quite enough to justify the cost.

During my most recent visit, the service was just okay. It’s worth mentioning that this was during a Padres game, so the restaurant was quite busy, which likely contributed to the slower service. Despite this, I would still recommend Blind Burro for a nice meal, but I’d suggest visiting when there isn’t a baseball game or other major event happening. Read more The food was wonderful!

But definitely less expensive than some other restaurants near the ballpark, so I guess you get what you pay for. Read more One of the loudest places we've ever eaten. Food was good. Waitress was great. Food came out fast.  Great food and great staff. Thought the music would be too loud but after walking in there was no issue with it.

Service was excellent. Drinks and food were fair. I ordered the Carnitas tacos and they were so greasy you could ring them out. We also ordered the nachos, the cheese used was a creamy cheese of some kind old cheeses which had a sour taste. The chicken on the nachos was not shredded or cut, it was so big, I pulled it off and cut it with a knife.

Beautiful setting, the service was excellent from “Serafim” and both the Quinoa Chaufa and Shrimp Carbonara were outstanding - pleasantly surprised by a very nice experience Read more Absolutely beautiful place to have an outdoor luncheon and drinks. They even brought a water bowl for my dog.   Highly recommend.  The staff were very friendly, the view was great and the food was delicious.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant  Great service and excellent view on the outside patio. We had a great time.  Read more We were seated at 8:30. Our orders were taken about 15 minutes later. We didn’t receive our food until 10:00.

Parties were seated after us, received their food before us, and had already left before our meals arrived.

I have had long waits at Veranda before but this was excessive. Read more It is a lovely place, my mom and I come very often. I love the musicians that play in the evening they are amazing.  Food was disappointing. The crab cakes were among the worst I’ve had, sort of a flavorless mush with no contrasting flavors or textures at all. The Caesar salad was made with tired, browned lettuce that shouldn’t have been  served. The salmon, fries, and bread service were all fine. Some of the wait staff was very friendly but one or two were actually quite rude and unhelpful. They apply a vague surcharge (I think something like 5%) to your bill before any gratuity. Read more Had a beautiful view table which we had put in the request. That was very appreciated. Server Randy very helpful. Food very good. However, surprised and not in the good way...""surcharge"" of $11.57 for 3 people. Would we have chosen a different place to eat, perhaps, but would have liked to know ahead of time. Read more First time there - great outdoor dining experience!  Great restaurant, was looking for a nice place that serves breakfast and found it. Fancy place, but the prices aren’t bad. I ordered 3 dishes and 2 drinks and it cost me 100 dollars. They also gave my wife and I a free slice of cake for our anniversary, which was very thoughtful. Read more Had a great meal outside with family.  Server was friendly and attentive.  Food was very tasty with good size portions.   Wife and son got the scallops and I got a quinoa dish….all were delicious! Read more The Veranda has a beautiful ambience with view of golf course and beyond. They had a guitar player and a lighted fireplace which added to the atmosphere. The food is excellent. We had the market salad with grilled shrimp and salmon. We also added the bread service with tomato pesto.  Drinks are great. Highly recommend this restaurant. Read more Limited wine list but decent.
Menu good but needs to be updated. Hamburger and swordfish were very good. Hummus appetizer was mediocre at best.

Service was average but bad but not impressive. Had to wave server down but he responded quickly.

Ambiance is fantastic Read more Everything was wonderful!! We got lucky and were able to sit inside! Can’t wait for next time!  Read more Great food, service, and ambiance. Only feedback is that my friend has an allergic reaction to vinegar that was not listed in the ingredients.  The food was really good although pricey. We sat outdoors and it was a beautiful venue. I would go back again.  This restaurant is consistently delicious. We added shrimp to our Caesar salad and the shrimp was grilled to perfection. The short ribs over mashed potatoes was outstanding. Portions are large so sharing is an option. Read more Food and service were great as usual.  Our server Ryan was a delight to my Sister and I as we celebrated our Birthday 🎉  Normally, the Veranda is a top notch place to eat. Tonight was the exception. First, the proteins were cooked to perfection, the steak medallions and the tomahawk pork chop.  The sides were the disappointment: burnt broccolini and fingerling potatoes. Could not eat them. The wedge salad is one of the best I have ever had and the the scoop of ice cream with the fresh berries was delicious. That being said, I eat there often and everything else I have ever ordered from there has been wonderful. Read more Our group of 4 had a really nice lunch at The Veranda.  Service, food, drinks and ambiance were all excellent. We sat along the edge of the patio and had a great golf course view.  Felt like we were on vacation for a couple of hours. Read more Same usual experience, quiet location, nice setup, friendly staff  We had an enjoyable dinner listening to live music.  Got the scallops & it’s barely an appetizers size. The spare ribs were average. Service was terrible.  This visit might be a little influenced by the surprisingly cool evening and the two women with out of control youngsters sitting next to us.  The Caesar salad we asked to split came in one plate and was left for us to split which is no big deal but always a nicer touch when they take care of it.  Also a finer touch but some of the romaine stalks in the Caesar were ones I would have put in the trash.  The ribeye filets were excellent and cooked as requested.  Bread service is an additional $9 for nothing special.  Wait staff was polite enough but not as friendly as most and did not configure umbrellas or heaters to improve our situation.  Overall, a nice venue and good night but I expect more for the price. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/30542900.webp

It’s our favorite place in coronado  Beautiful restaurant with excellent food and service. I had the rack of lamb and my husband had a steak. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked. Our waiter was attentive and engaging making our dining experience a pleasure. We were there celebrating our anniversary and it was a leisurely well paced evening. I highly recommend a visit. Read more Excellent onion soup, New York steak was delicious and great salmon, there for a birthday, will definitely go back  Todo estaba delicioso  pero todooooo
Es un rest que nos encanta  Chez Loma is a great alternative when visiting Coronado. Quiet small intimate. Our food was excellent as was the service. We’ll be back and I feel it may become a favorite.  Beet salad, artichoke appetizer, potatoes au gratin, salmon, cream brûlée, and carrot cake…all were just superb…one of the best meals we’ve EVER had!  Everything was perfect last night
Mom and I shared the beet salad and the prime rib with delicious French Fries.
The service  was fantastic. From the minute of arrival when the staff offered to assist with my mom due to her disability and wheelchair to the very last moment of our meal.
The beet salad was wonderful. I would love to see maybe some goat cheese crumbles added and a few pine nuts instead of the frothy cream?😉
The meat was cooked to perfection!!! We ordered medium and it was tasty, juicy and tender.
We had a glass of Prosecco and no dessert.
It’s a little expensive but, we feel we pay for not only food but, attention to customer, and beautiful ambiance. Read more Chez Loma is a quaint neighborhood gem of a restaurant! Rajid took exceptional care of us, from creating custom drinks, pacing out the dinner to making sure our every need was fulfilled. 
We started with the French onion soup and crab cake- both amazing. Then split a wagyu burger that was cooked to perfection. It was a tough choice because so many items on the menu were tempting us - Chicken and lobster Mac n cheese in particular. 
Decided we just need to return soon and go through the menu each visit. Definitely recommend this spot for a meal you won’t forget and service that’s above par! Read more Fue una magnífica cena y atención éramos 12 y todos salimos felices y sorprendidos de el buen servicio y calidad  I believe Chez Loma may be making a remarkable comeback. As a San Diego local since the mid-1980s, I fondly recall my father introducing me to this French staple in Coronado, which I believe was established in 1978. After several years of disappointing experiences, I had reluctantly placed it on my list of places to avoid due to subpar food and service.

However, yesterday, I decided to give Chez Loma one final chance. I reserved an outdoor table and was warmly welcomed by Valeria. Our server for the evening, Kevin, provided exceptional service, supported by the excellent teamwork of Miguel and Helmut. Rachid, the new manager, not only crafted superb martinis but has seemingly revitalized the restaurant to its former glory. The food, drinks, and ambiance were all outstanding.

My only suggestion would be to tailor the music selection more to the establishment’s atmosphere. While I appreciate Huey Lewis & The News and Guns N’ Roses, their music didn’t quite align with the restaurant’s vibe or clientele. Later in the evening, with the introduction of Sinatra and some classic Stéphane Pompougnac, the ambiance became much more fitting and enjoyable.

It was a perfect evening. I hope Chez Loma continues to uphold this standard for its loyal patrons.

Kudos once again to Kevin and Rachid for their exceptional efforts! Read more Read more Chez Loma is always consistently fantastic! Service, food and ambiance brought us back for our second visit year ago, and service, food and ambiance has brought us back over and over ever since! A must go to restaurant when wanting an awesome meal, great service and lovely experience! Read more Outstanding seafood and steak. Great service. A great place for quiet conversation over delicious food that isn’t rushed.  You guys put together a quality operation with a low noise level for this old sailor  Excellent food and wonderful service.
Cozy dining room with small number of tables in main room. Escargot, lobster tail salad, Rocky fish special, roasted ducking with sides and yummy chocolate cake with birthday candle.
This was my second visit and just as great. Appreciated the saxophone player, but music a bit loud for small foyer area near the  two dining rooms. I would highly recommend this lovely restaurant in house atmosphere. Great location near hotels, beach, shops. Read more Made a reservation for one, and it was assumed for 2. Needless to say that I was ignored for a significant amount of time. I watched two other parties get seated, read the specials, and served bread. I was asked if I wanted water and later if I wanted to order a drink. After a while, I was asked if I needed anything. Yes, to order my food. Then I was asked if I wanted bread. Didn't get read the specials. It was really hard to sit there and go through this. I finished my dinner and left. The server was nice enough to give me a desert drink sample for free, which almost made me tear up. Read more Great place! This place is well on its way to becoming our favorite!  Great place!  Our new favorite restaurant here on the Island!  Highly recommend!!  Great service and ambiance. Excellent location. Parking was a challenge.  What an improvement! New chef is amazing! Great service. Upgraded interior. Very wonderful meal!
Rashid is amazing!  We had a large party of 16 and they accommodated us nicely in the upstairs room. Kevin was our waiter and didn’t miss a beat. The food was absolutely delicious and we will no doubt the next time we are in Coronado. Read more Read more Very very nice place to have either a friends reunion or a romantic dinner  It was a Friday night and very busy. At no time did we feel we were waiting for a waiter to attend to us. If they were busy, another waiter stepped in and helped out. What a concept!! The staff and Art, in particular, were great. Even though it was very busy, there was a relaxed feeling about the restaurant, like a great little neighborhood hang-out. And it is a great neighborhood hangout, as it should be. A good reason is because the food is really, really good. And the drinks are creative and very good as well. It is a little pricey but not crazy. I like to cook at home, so when I go out, I always try to have something I would never make at home. I had the roasted duck. Excellent as was the pureed butternut squash with it. One of our group had the chicken milanese, which was one of the cheapest entrees, but to me, the best of the bunch. The grilled artichoke app was outstanding as well. The creme brulee was a great way to finish off the dinner. This has become a new favorite and we will be visiting in the future, perhaps just to sit at the bar and have a couple of cocktails and dinner. Read more Wow! The food offered exceptional flavors and best experience dining we could imagine. A historic house. A concerned hostess wanting to find the right table for us and offering a few options where to sit. Our waiter came over immediately and stayed attentive the entire evening. My husband got the lobster ravioli made in house with lobster both in the ravioli and a small tail on top. I ordered chicken Milanese which had salad greens on top and the crunchy breading was oh so tasty. The whole meal was phenomenal. I read a few negative reviews that made me nervous which spoke of a dusty old house… what? Everything looked impeccably clean. Pricing was so reasonable for such great creative entrees. This place is experience dining at its best! Read more I was reluctant to have our anniversary dinner at Chez Loma because of a bad experience some time ago.  Clearly, they have got it together now!  Sam took care of us and did a great job.  We had six oysters and the scallop sashimi for appetizers.  Simply loved the sashimi.  We split a caesar salad and the chef even found some anchovies to put on top.  My husband had the halibut special and said it was just ok.  I had the pecan crusted chicken with arugula.  Now I NEVER order chicken out but this is now a destination dish.  Hard to describe how good it is.  We will be back. Read more A hidden gem!
Our favorite in Coronado!
Everything was delicious!
Could go there everyday! Read more Great atmosphere, great service, great food ! I’m happy to celebrate birthday there  Had to wait 25 minutes for our table despite making a reservation.  Great location; the food, when it eventually came, was very good; do not seem to be set up for outside dining, we often had to wait 15 or more minutes to see a waiter tending the outdoor tables.  Our waiter was awesome but we think stretched thin. Read more Chez Loma is a landmark Coronado restaurant housed in a quaint though somewhat tired old house. The bar used to be a lively gathering place for happy hour for locals and the lucky tourist who happened in. The focus now is just dinner service with several tables outside, a few in the bar along with bar seating and the more formal feeling dining rooms.
Dinner started with delicious bread and attentive service. Unfortunately the rest of the meal was uninspired. The baked oysters were doused in an overwhelming(soy?) sauce, the over cooked roasted duck was served with a meager side and our dinner companion was disappointed in the fish of the day.
With a spread in the local paper touting the new ownership, we were hopeful that there would be changes in the kitchen, too. Not so. Read more Food was excellent, service was super slow,  20 minutes to get a glass of wine and a cocktail and 40 minute wait for dessert.  We waited 15 minutes after asking for the bill and then another 10 minutes for them to pick it up with my credit card.

Food was delicious but too slow of service . Read more There were a couple large groups and we got very little attention from the staff.  It was as if we were being served by committee, but no one was talking to one another.  Basic things took a long time and often required that we ask more than once, often to a different person.

What is it for? Why do they do it? Feeling like I get nickled and dimed to death with this kind of surcharge.

The food was good.  I enjoyed my manicotti and my wife enjoyed her chicken piccata, but I would not say they were substantially better than many Italian restaurants I've been to.

I was so excited to try this highly rated and awarded Danish restaurant. It was everything I hoped it would be and actually more. Tina’s warm greeting and friendly service is really superb. The food so incredible flavorful and cooked to perfection. I bought a loaf of bread to go and it’s the best rye bread I have tasted. Solvang and other so called Danish places doesn’t even come close to what you get here. 
Highly recommend. Read more OMG. Better than I even imagined. This is a hole-in-wall type shop with the most welcoming host/owner who exudes warmth and kind energy. The food is FANTASTIC. I think about their hot dogs more often than I'd like to admit. We each ordered one and paired it with her recommendation of beer. We followed that with a homemade danish each and...phew. We fell in love. Can't wait to come back! Read more As a Dane living in the US, it’s hard to find somewhere that tastes like home. Taste of Denmark has nailed it.

Read more This place tastes like my mom’s cooking and wish she was still around to taste it!! Great place for a weekend family lunch 🇩🇰🇺🇸  We had never eaten Danish food. It was delicious.

Read more If you want to taste real Danish food, Taste of Denmark is a great place.  Super good service who loves to talk about the food.  Original tasty Danish dishes. Owners super friendly.  My husband is from Esbjerg, Denmark and he absolutely loved the food. The owner was also from Esbjerg but we didn’t know that when we made the reservation. The food was amazing. The flæskestegsburger Was so good I want to go back next week for it again. The owner even brought out a sausage for my pup
Highly recommend taste of Denmark Read more A must do! Seek out this charming and delicious experience as one of the best townie and special memories in San Diego, and in Hillcrest. It should not be missed.

From the thoughtful touches to the incredible food lovingly prepared to the delightful, friendly and knowledgeable owner/host/server, this was a truly outstanding and delicious experience and memory. 

We sat near a Dane who came from up north to eat home-cooked, traditional food and take away several orders for later! If good enough for expats, good enough for us. 

We enjoyed meatballs with gravy and a side of heavenly crème fraîche potato salad, scrumptious open-faced sandwiches, hot-out-of-the-oven danishes (raspberry and apple) and one of the best hot dogs we’ve ever had. 

The appetizer plate sets the palate and course and is filled with tasty bites of traditional and homemade rye bread, red cabbage and caper rémoulade. We drank great German beer from their super selection in chilled, traditional steins. 

We had fresh, hot coffee-made for us-and an outdoor sidewalk patio table, taking in the sites while enjoying the best food. For our anniversary, she even brought us a glass of bubbly to celebrate and share! Incredible food, service, care and memory. 

If you eat at only one place in Hillcrest, it should be here. Read more Read more Delicious and such kind, solicitous service from the proprietor. We’ll be back!  The food is amazing and the service is friendly  Staff super nice and attentive. Food is fresh and homemade. Menu is small but quality is delicious.  Well worth an effort.

All of the staff are pleasant and helpful Read more Having a good experience in restaurants has become a toss of the dice for many of them.  Thankfully, Black Angus has resisted the urge to politicize their establishment and corporate communications.  They have retained excellent food and service, which leads to a pleasant and satisfying experience.  Reliably good food and attention to customer satisfaction has been and continues to be their focus.  In light of that, the expense is bearable, though California government politics is making it increasingly difficult to afford, as their meddling with the free market has forced many restaurants to compromise on quality.  Thankfully, Black Angus continues to be the food establishment of choice for discriminating connoisseurs of a fine steak. Read more This was my birthday dinner it started out fine. We ordered no problem so far. The only specifics to our order was that there was to be no pickles on my bacon burger because I'm allergic to it. We received our orders and first thing I noticed there were pickles and a lot of them on my burger. We sent it back and while my wife ate her dinner, I had nothing in front of me and it was 15 minutes later we had to get the manager to our table to find out what the heck was going on with our order. We must've waited another 10 minutes. I finally got my burger while my wife's food got cold, waiting for me. The waitress that took our order, insisted that she told the cook and that she had to get the manager involved, which was a total lie because we were the ones that got another server to go get the manager to come to our table. Overall, the service was very poor. This was not a good birthday dinner for me and we probably will never go back. Read more I haven’t been in this restaurant for a long time , but my experience on that time we were there is outstanding .  Our server is very nice .  I will comeback again.  We sat in the lounge, and the TVs were too loud.
Xlnt food, good service, fair prices  As always we had a great meal at a great value with excellent service. Our server Marley was very attentive and got us everything we wanted in a timely manner.  Great server! Also spoke to the General Manager Ashley  and told her what a great job they were doing in offering special deals at great prices-even free delivery.  So if you don't want to go out to the restaurant you can have it delivered for free! Keep up the good work Ashley! Read more It was our anniversary with reservations at 6:45 pm.  We arrived at 6:30pm, seated timely at 6:45pm.  The restaurant side was virtually empty.

About 15 minutes with no attention,  a kind gentleman from the kitchen brought us bread and we asked about drinks. He asked if we had been helped..we confirmed no.  He went to get our server.

She took our drink order.  After drinks arrived,  we placed our order which seemed to take long to be ready.  In the meantime, other employees were gathered in the back laughing and talking which included the manager I eventually spoke to.  My love went and inquired about our meals.

The food overall was good.  The steaks were ordered medium well but came well done which was disappointing. 

I finally asked for the manager to discuss the poor service and perception.  She explained everything the staff has to do and overtalked us.  At this point, I stopped the conversation sharing I didd not appreciate being made wrong and requested our check.  The manager insisted on not charging us for the bad experience.  Our intention was to make the manager aware so they could do better..not get a free meal.

Communication is key and could have made a difference if the server explained delays.  The perception is there was time for other employees and the manager to chat and laugh.  We were the only patrons we saw on the restaurant side.    Could someone else assisted with drinks?

We have come here for years loving the food and experience.   This was the worst Black Angus experience ever and unfortunately made for a sad anniversary. We will not be back. Read more One my go to spots. Waiter Dave was spot on!
Busy Friday night  Fantastic service, quality food, affordable prices  Read more Was a great meal with excellent service. Server was attentive and friendly.  The staff were wonderful and accommodating. Laura was an outstanding server who was very sweet. Food and drinks were great as usual.  The manager. Not sure if her name. Was awesome!!!!  We hadn’t been to Black Angus for many, many years. On a whim we decided to go check it out due to wanting a good steak. We had reservations and were seated right away. Our server Laura was absolutely fantastic. She was polite, patient, and informative. She checked on our table many times. We received our food in a very timely manner and it was exactly what was ordered. Steak was perfectly cooked, lobster was delicious. Overall this turned out to be a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back soon. Read more We enjoyed our dinner and everything was cooked perfectly.  But, best of all was our waitress Peyton, she was so friendly and efficient. Made the night excellent!  They got my bill wrong. I then had to wait 15 minutes to get it corrected and paid. It was extremely frustrating just sitting there.  Had the steak n lobster, the whole meal was well prepared and meat was cooked as requested.  We had reservations at 5:00 for a standard table. We arrived at 4:50 and were told we would not be seated until 5. At 5 we were informed that there was only one server in the dining room and the only table we could be seated at was in the bar. We said we didn’t want to sit in the bar and were told we could either sit there or wait until 5:30 or later.  There was a family seated immediately after us, also in the bar, who were still waiting to receive their food after we had had dinner and dessert and were leaving. He was speaking to the manager who was actually arguing with him!!  Very very poor customer relations!!  We are regulars here but are reconsidering ever going back. Read more The food was excellent quality. Our server Sam was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  We had the Porterhouse special, and it was delicious. We also tried the new crispy cauliflower and Mataki mushrooms appetizer.  We were not a fan as it was too spicy. But Christina exchanged it for a  different appetizer. Much better. Finally we also enjoyed the wine of the month for only $13 a bottle of Copola Cabernet. What a great deal.  It was a wonderful evening. Christina is the best! Read more Read more The Campfire meal fir two is always the best deal if you get there before 6 pm. Steaks are always good and the chocolate chip cookie dessert is the best 

The only complaint i have was that the server never came back and checked on us or asked how the food was.  Also, when the food was served by another person, they forgot to give us one of our side dishes. Read more Food was awful.  Olivia the bartender was excellent but she could not make up for the unbelievably bad food.  Prime rib was actually gray when it came out. Tough and bland.  App sampler was awful.  Dessert too.  Salad was ok.  Do not recommend Read more Absolutely horrible. Took an hour to even get our food and they let little kids run around the whole place screaming  Rich, the bartender was our server.
Drinks, food and service all wonderful.  Overall good experience. Was sat quickly, friendly server. It seemed like server was distracted (looked like maybe doing mobile orders) so had to ask another server for refills  Usually no problems here but we came at 530 pm. A lot of people come at opening for happy hour. They were not able to handle the volume of customers that arrived 5-6. Service very slow. Drinks came after appetizers arrived, one person didn't get soup, and dinner arrived moments after we got our salad/soup. One steak was practically raw when medium was ordered. I'm sure next visit will be better but I'd avoid the opening time. Read more We made reservations in the bar for a booth.   On arrival, the hostess told us one wasn't available.  
Could we eat in the restaurant instead?  We said no, we wanted the bar--she said she didn't have enough servers in there.  We were not allowed to sit at a table or an open booth and order drinks from the bartender- only one small area next to the bar. There was no seating for 4 in that small area!  The servers in the bar were confused as to why she said that and were telling us we were welcome to sit.   
4 or 5 booths were in use with the rest open.  We were happy to just sit and talk to friends until one became available.  
We were seated after other staff must of mentioned it and after that our night was good.   We had a good waiter.
The restaurant was not busy and I feel the hostess put the damper on the evening.   Happy that the rest of the staff were great!! Read more Their wedge salad is one of the best.  I do wish their baked potatoes were a little bigger. I had the salmon it was good. My husband's go to is the Prime Rib. It was excellent along with his sides mac &cheese and au gratin potatoes.

I gave some low marks for a few specifics issues.
Service - Jacob our waiter was great! 
The Host/Hostess terrible. The Hostess was on the snobbish side. Our reservation was for 700pm. We checked in at 645pm, however they made us wait until exactly 700pm, not a second before. All the while I saw another couple be seated immediately 649pm. Either they were late or early, but they should not have been seated before us. Very tacky!
Food - Ceasar salad was smothered in black pepper. Normally the server asks when they serve it. Was not offered any cheese. Bread was terrible. Had a bug in my Jack n Coke! How could a bartender allow this to happen?! Tells me something unsanitary going on behind the Bar. The waiter returned it with a new one, however it should have been removed from the Bill.
This dinner was for our 25th Anniversary, and was very disappointing.
Will NOT ever return! Read more Our reservation was for 6:30.

We tried for almost an hour and got a busy signal or it sounded like the phone was off the hook. So we called the front desk and they just told us to go ahead and go down there that they would take care of it for us . Immediately walking in the front staff was annoyed that we were there . The waitress was extremely distracted and didn’t seem to care for good service. We were never offered refills on our wine. We were never offered a dessert menu.

Very unpleasant overall Read more Terrible food, great view, and attentive servers. But food was horrible - mussels were dry, salad dressing bland and gelatinous . Won't go again.  Great Location, service was great and the food was ok. Shrimp and fish were over fried.  Way to overpriced for the quality of food. I’ve been eating the steam pod for years and it is getting worse every year.  Food wasn’t fresh.  The seafood was in the freezer too long  It was very pleasant. The staff was friendly.

Read more My husband and I decided to try Joe's Crab Shack as it was a convenient restaurant to go to since we were attending a concert at the Rady Shell in San Diego. The server who was attending our table, was unrelenting in trying to get us to buy a $25 membership that would allow us to gain points and free parking..which we found out later was only for 1 1/2 hours, which our server said the membership granted us "" VIP"" status and we would be able to park there for the entire evening. Her hard-sell was extremely annoying and persisted after we had finished our meal. The meal itself was mediocre at best. The bulk of the menu consisted of deep fried items, so we opted for the salmon and flounder..not too good, as the salmon was very dry and flounder my husband found overly spicy. Last time for us at Joe's Crab Shack. Wished is would have been a better experience. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/3/66273465.webp

They didn’t say sorry and server arrived 30 minutes after I got the table .  Our waitress was amazing! The reason for the mediocre review is the hostess service was terrible. We had a reservation for 6:45pm and we were told that we would need to be added to a waiting list still. This was somewhat understandable because of the 4th of July holiday. What ended up happening though is we never heard back from the waitlist for 30+ minutes and when I came back to the hostess stand, I overheard them bringing parties that were larger than mine with reservations later than mine to their seats. I would severely question the host/hostess working that night if I was the manager. The food was good/ok but maybe a little overpriced.

Dion take care of our needs but gave us some good space to enjoy dinner. Would definitely go again  Slow service - no water for 15min, no one took our order until 20min after being seated, food took a long time to get to the table, one of our appetizers was forgotten which we had to point out to the server and was not brought out to us until after we got our entrees.

Made an open table reservation because I wasn’t sure, it is the college area and it was a little later than dinner time. Our table was ready even with her name on it, pizza was great as always, great beer selection and really amazing salads. Thanks Woodstocks you did not disappoint Read more Great place- high energy, good food. Great location for SDSU families  We were happy to see a table reserved for us. Service was great. Someone was checking on us regularly.  Service was slow. Pizza came to table at different times. 1 hour and 20 minute wait after placing order. Bused our own table so we could have a clean place to sit. Beer glass had a huge chip in rim.

Always quality pizza and excellent craft beer at this College Area fixture.  Pizza is amazing. We had a group of 10 and reserved a table, which they had ready for us. Noise level was perfect as we had 4 kids with us. We highly recommend!  Read more Great experience!  The pizza was good but for an extra large I paid almost 30$ and it wasn’t that sufficient for the value  Great place and awesome food if you don’t mind the price.  Low-key pizza restaurant close to the university with delicious food!  The pizza and crazy bread are what we came for, but the spinach salad was a surprise hit as well--tons of toppings, and the candied pecans made it. The freshly made ranch dressing is some of the best I've ever tasted, so make sure to ask for extra for dipping. They're known for their pizza and bread and they didn't disappoint--soft and flavorful and loaded with toppings. The music was a little random, but didn't bother us at all. A great place if you're looking for a casual environment with tasty food. Read more",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/1/25015509.webp

Daytime service is as it always has been: order at the counter and the food will be brought to you in the seating area we have created outside under the tents. Night-time is full service. Sunday through Thursday is upstairs. The tables are spaced far apart and there is an option of being out on the front deck for parties of two. On Friday and Saturday, we will be offering full service in both seating areas of upstairs and under the tents outside.

We provide food options that serve the needs of people who enjoy the outdoors and have a high degree of awareness for their health, fitness and well being.

Our food was delicious and Charlie took great care of us! We love dining here and look forward to returning again soon.  California casual and healthy, delicious comfort food.  Last night we enjoyed an assortment of happy hour appetizers and an amazing scratch soup/chili, poblano chicken white chili.  The fog was nowhere in sight so we enjoyed a gorgeous ocean sunset too. Read more Nice casual restaurant.  On a clear day, views are amazing  Had a great experience!  Group of 11 from out of town.  Really enjoyed the food and drinks.  Standout was the coconut shrimp appetizer!!  Our server was terrific as well.  Kai’s is a great “local’s” restaurant with friendly service, quality food, an an exceptional view of the beach. The ambiance is unpretentious and tidy. The servers and management are friendly and attentive. This restaurant has a low key vibe.  The wine list could be upgraded. While there are many favorite dishes that we keep coming back to, it would be nice to see a fresh look at options.  But this comes from our point of view inclusive of 23 years of visits. There are plenty of diverse options for newcomers. On nights with musical entertainment, it doesn’t overwhelm the restaurant. The main room noise level is definitely not for conversation when the band plays, but both patio areas provide space to hear the music but still be able to chat.

During this visit we heard the Benedetti Trio play. They partnered with the dining experience perfectly. Read more Ki's is our favorite restaurant!  We brought a friend with us for dinner, and now he's hooked and plans to bring his wife!  Great food but disappointing service. Details sent to restaurant directly.  Good food, easy to order.

Read more Forgot to tell the server we had a play to go to, once we realized the time and let the server know, she and the restaurant quickly brought out our food. I had the steak and my wife had the vegan curry, both were very good. Will come back and plan on having a more leisurely dinner. Read more Great view great food! The service was quick.

Could not have found something that had everything we were looking for, and a great view of the sunset over the ocean.
I’ve paid double for the entrees at fine dining restaurants that didn’t taste as good.

Little loud in there but that’s all the negative I have for this hidden gem. Read more 7:15 reservation on a Monday night. There was a decent crowd, but not too busy. The food was excellent as always. By the time we got to dessert they were out of a few things, but we closed the place down.  Definitely one of the best places to catch sunset with some amazing food on the coast. Read more Food was very tasty and the view was lovely. My Thai chicken salad with peanut sauce was delicious! There is no table service, which we would much prefer. Otherwise, we recommend.  Friendly low key vibe matched with great view of sea and delicious entrees...salmon salad and halibut along with excellent bread and worth it lemon olive oil cake.  All was good. Food quality was excellent, quantity has decreased but that’s ok, prices are still good.  Painting class made it very difficult for us to hear each other.  Much too noisy for a music venue. We went to hear the music on a Friday evening and the noise level was so loud we couldn’t hear the music. The food was good and the service excellent, but not the best place to go if you actually want to listen to music Read more Read more Great casual dining with ocean view! The dinner menu has versatile and delicious options for vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores alike. They will also modify your order as you request.  Best to have reservations for dinner. Read more Kis is a favorite local spot with consistently good food.  It's self service at lunch, with servers at dinner. Great views add to the appeal.  Beautiful view of Cardiff Beach with friendly staff snd diverse, reasonably priced menu!  Love this local, casual, beachy-vibe cafe/restaurant with an amazing ocean view on Pacific Coast Highway.

What lured us in on July 5th was dinner with a saxophone trio - a promise of music and a better world with each note.  Turns out The Mark Lessman Trio has long history with this family-owned restaurant.

Enjoyed my grilled salmon salad and my husband loved his red curry with jasmine rice.
We also appreciate the array of beverages both spirits and non alcohol beers and kombucha.

A very satisfying experience. Read more I love this place, easy parking and free. Super great view of the ocean and the Happy Hour menu is excellent. Ordered the flat bread off the dinner menu and it was delicious! Just a really good place to go! Read more Great experience: there is a wide variety of choices, vegetarian and non-veg. We sat where we could see the ocean, another plus. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We were there mid-afternoon on a Sunday and it was quiet and peaceful, so we could hear each other speaking.  Each of us, 8 guests, liked our food.  Hamburgers, wraps and bowls all hit the spot.  Thanks Ki's! Read more Horrible Service by server “Rain” Lived here for 30 years but never tried Ki’s. So first time, also first time posting a review on service. I have a degree in hospitality from Cornell, and have a very successful career in the restaurant/real estate world. Travel and eat out extensively all over the world. That being said, here goes; The good, location, view (not beachfront, but ocean and sunset visible) parking is OK, (there is parking, limited). Food is slightly above average, (nothing to remember and come back for). Ambiance ehh.  The service is way below par! Basically ruins the entire meal and experience for all of us! Completely forgotten about, had to get the waitress to come take desert order, finally ordered, then waited forever, then only one dessert came out! Asked where are the other deserts, response “ oh we got slammed with a 12 top, sorry”. WOW, we had reservations, we were especially polite, it was our first time there( informed staff of that).
We and everyone we know in Del Mar, are never going back, plenty of other options either better views, better food, better everything, ESPECIALLY SERVICE, pick somewhere, anywhere else! Cheers!

Min early for a 7:00 reservation.  With many open tables we were told it would be a bit before we could get seated.   While we waited several tables got seated.

Tables that came in around our time and tables that were seated after were done and gone before we ever got our food.  I asked for a manager, and he came and apologized but had our food.

Brandon, our server, was great! He was friendly and attentive to whatever we needed. What’s most important is that he was patient and respectful even tho we are in our 70s & 80s mixed in with a younger crowd. 
The Happy Hour wine selection was sooo good I purchased two bottles of it on the way out at their special price.

Aging interior, no outdoor dining not enough staff and terrible tasting food! Hilton should completely renovate and invest in this beautiful location, add more staff and add dining space to the outdoor terraces which overlook Torrey Pines and the ocean!
The waiters were exceptionally nice but they cannot single handedly make up for bad food and overlooked restaurant. Read more Made reservations for a late lunch on a Saturday at 2:30, but when we arrived was told they stopped serving lunch at 2:00. I didn't see that posted anywhere on the lunch menu or online, so was disappointed to have to order off the Bar Menu instead.  The BBQ wings were fatty and way too spicy. The taco plate was bland. The avocado chicken salad was quite tasty but cost $21 which is very steep for a salad. The waiter was wonderful and only charged us for what we were satisfied with, but the dining experience as a whole was rather disappointing. I had been to this restaurant one other time this year and the food from the regular lunch menu was very good - enough to make me want to go back and take my husband.

Ambiance is “hotel bar” dining which is not what we expected but the wait staff made up for it. Read more In town for a wedding. Had dinner with relatives. Love the ambiance and service was fabulous. 

The food however is a terrible value for such mediocre quality food. 

Many entrees are around $50. Pork chops were so dry it was hard to cut and chew it.  It was left uneaten.  Salmon was good but not great for its over $35 price. 
The ribeye is one of the expensive entrees and the cut of meat is so thin . The steak looked a bit grey and was not fresh or any kind of special aged beef or even prepared with a rub!  It was so thin and something you might see a Sizzlers.  At $50 they could have offered a better quality meat!

Food was expensive and while that is not a problem for me the food wasn't that good so it was a disappointment ($800 for a party of 9, yes we did have cocktails!). 

That would have been ok, I really have low expectations for Hotel Restaurants but the staff at the bar were slow and rude both times we were there and normally higher end hotels have the bar thing down but clearly the La Jolla Hilton did not.

I ordered the egg/protein breakfast (or something like that) The over easy eggs were very bland and one of the eggs yolks was broken. The turkey bacon was so-so. The bagel provided was not so great. It was a lot of money. If staying at the hotel, that breakfast would have been free for me as a Hilton Gold member. As someone coming in from the outside, it was a very large $15+ bill.

We arrived one hour before our reservation time , but were still seated promptly.  The service staff was top notch and very attentive throughout the entire dinner.  For dinner, four members of our party ordered the traditional Thanksgiving dinner and it was excellent.  The fifth person ordered a prime rib dinner, cooked medium.  The prime rib was brought to the table at the same time as the traditional turkey dinners, but the meat was extremely rare.  At first the person did not want to complain, but within five minutes realized that it was too rare for their taste.  They asked that the it be cooked a little more and our waiter, who was very accommodating, took it back to the kitchen.  Unfortunately, when it was returned to the table it was overcooked to the point of being inedible.  We chose not to make it an issue and nothing was said at the time.

Food wasn't as good as it used to be  Honestly, I was so disappointed. The food was obviously made ahead of time and had little to no flavor. The past was blah, overcooked and mushy. The sauces were boring with no flavor. This is not Italian food and to top it off the zucchini blossoms were coated in layers of dough and we couldn't tell what they actually were.

Read more We were very disappointed. We’ve gone to Davanti for years, though we haven’t been for quite some time. Years ago the food was good. This time the meal was well below what we expected and was reminiscent of hastily prepared strip mall food court meals.
1. We had the steak special. It was overcooked and served cold. It was topped by a watery white sauce without flavor. Over the steak was heavily sprinkled with battered fried onions. The onions were obviously out of a can.
2. We had the fried zucchini blossoms. They were covered in an oily heavy tempura and were overstuffed with tasteless cheese. The “blossoms“ disappeared within basically a deep fried tempura chews glob.
Sorry to say, after years of going to Davanti we will find a different place to dine before a movie. Read more Its changed since the last time we were there. A lot of food we ordered tasted like it was frozen and heated up.  And everything was bland.   Which sucks because we used to love going there. Maybe just order Hamburgers or Pizza to be safe. Read more Great food as always. Nice red sauce. However, the Bread was not great.  Great place for date night or family night. You need to check it out.  Love the food here - lots of options and good at accommodating allergies. Fun ambience and enjoy the covered patio with space heaters. Staff are friendly and helpful.  An early dinner was Ok. The limited service slowed down the ability to order and to get the meals in a reasonable time. Better wait staff, or perhaps more of them would solve the problem. They can add attendance just by staffing based in part on the movies at a nearby theater. An example, a movie gets out between 5-7+pm, you might try to attract the hundreds of people leaving the movies. Read more Appetizers are a little pricey but flavor was great so it balanced out. My meal was fantastic but my friend ordered the Lobster Ravioli and there was no Lobster.  If you're charging 5 star prices and bring out a dish with no Lobster that really is sad. We sent the plate back and ordered the lasagna which was very good. We ordered 3 desserts (tiramisu, cheesecake, lava cake) and this was the biggest disappointment. The cheesecake was rock hard. The lack cake wasn't anything like the description. Lava cakes are warm with warm chocolate or fudge in the middle. What we got was a frozen chocolate ""cake"" that was more like a chocolate ganache, no hazelnuts as described on the menu. We sent it back and it came back warmed. I'll give the chef credit for trying but just take it off the menu. That's false advertising as it is not a lava cake at all. If you come here for a main course only the food is 5/5. Service was also 5/5 Read more Always a great place! We had the pate’, the focaccia, and the lava cake and they were all delicious.  We were disappointed with the food.  Do they have a new chef?",https://resizer.otstatic.com/v2/photos/xlarge/4/53266659.webp

Not being able to pick your seat is disappointing even if you show up early. They assign you wherever they want you to sit, so it's not first come first serve as stated.

Went here for a ""movie night"" not knowing what to expect, not expecting too much. The setup was pretty ok, many tables had a tree or lamp or something blocking some part of the screen (including our table) but it wasn't a huge deal. We did get there super early before it started so we didn't get the best table. We were near the back and the audio wasn't suited very well for those of us sitting near the back, again not a huge deal, its an outdoor movie at a restaurant not a movie theater and I supposed they are doing what they can. The service however was terrible. I watched 4 different people try to deliver the wrong food to the table in front of us, and then continue to unsuccessfully ask every table around it if this was their order, which never ended with the right table. Our waitress visited us once about every 20 minutes, and the food was very subpar and over priced. We got carne asada nachos which came with pretty burnt and charred meat, along with We ordered a couple cocktails some of which were decent (the sunset collins) however the spicy watermelon margarita was terrible. I understand this isn't a fine dining establishment, that doesn't carry the ambience of a great movie showing location, but the price of entry equates to almost movie ticket prices and the food quality did not equate to their price either.

We had a reservation, and they have a beautiful, warm dining room, but they sat us outside on an oversized table surrounded by plastic tarps ... hmm (a different experience obviously). The cocktails were great. They gnocchi was great, though it would have been better w/o the truffle. Bill's filet mignon was fair. I had the ciopinno but didn't eat much of it - they had a very appealing-looking giant prawn, but it was so overcooked it was inedibly chewy. The calimari was hit and miss - some soft, some chewy.

The food was excellent. My family and I shared the Margarita pizza and sea bass. My son had a pasta dish that they made for him that was off menu. That was a nice touch.

I loved the pizza. 
  My wife thought the food was too acidic with too much tomato sauce. Now the food did have a lot of tomato sauce so keep that in mind for folks with sensitive stomachs. The Seabass did had a lot of tomato pesto sauce, however, I enjoyed it a lot. 
   They also had a nice selection of Italian wine which I had two. They were excellent and matched the theme of the restaurant. 
    For desert we had a chocolate gelato with a lava center. very delicious. 
Service was good and the main servers were Italian(I think) which added to the ambience. However, we asked for water to start and we were given a bottle to pour ourselves. For a casual/casual/upsacle they should pour it for you. 
    Value was good but still a $188 bill with tip included. There are a few other local casual/upscale that have a slightly better value (Nicks Del Mar $174 w/tip 3 mains) but having pizza is a great change of pace. Overall Good experience.

I complain about this at every restaurant who serves fake crab.  Customer shouldn’t have to ask.  It should be listed on the menu as “imitation crab” rather as just crab.  Waiter wasn’t sure and had to go ask.  Another pet peeve.  Waiter should know the menu.

We were then seated in the bar which was so loud normal conversation was not possible. It was deafening at times. Then 30 minutes after ordering, we were informed my wife’s entree was no longer available, at 7 PM in the evening. We substituted another dish which about 50% more expensive, and were charged the full amount. The manager did give us two free glasses of wine, which we didn’t want, and were left mostly unconsumed. To top it off, the server set the Toast payment device so the 20% gratuity was calculated on the full amount, including the comped wine glasses. I guess they thought we were too stupid to notice?

Went to the hostess stand to complain and waited again for another 5 minutes.  Finally spoke to the manager and finally got a server.  Second time we have received poor service and seems to be a chronic issue for this restaurant.  Do like the food which is a shame as we won’t be back.  No reason to pay for higher end prices for a meal and receive such poor service.  Manager didn’t even bother to come by at end of meal to apologize. Read more We dined on a Monday evening. The restaurant was not busy that evening. Dined on the upper deck and we’re well taken care of by the team. Sat at the fire table after dinner and enjoyed the evening.

The meal I ordered was not as it was listed on the menu, the noise level was stupidly crazy loud,

It was appalling.   And I never give bad reviews. Read more Busy!!!, Greeting not good. Food good. Waitress good. Staff burnt out.

Great view, okay service (but they were understaffed so not the servers fault!), delightful food, love the wine Wednesday deal!  Unfortunately there was a shift change shortly after we arrived.  New waiter was less than engaging.  Didn't seem happy to be there.   We requested some time to talk before ordering and enjoy our drinks.  When we did order, Margherita pizza, eggplant parm, and short rib papardelle, everything arrived cold or lukewarm.   So we asked for a new pizza and the other 2 entrees to be reheated.   Better the second time, but food was not great.  Service was so-so and food was disappointing.   Don't think I  would return. Read more I liked the venue and the service was outstanding.  They claim that their pasta is homemade, but when we got it, the lasagna was cool inside and the ravioli was very bland.  I suspect they have a local place make the pasta and deliver it to the restaurant daily.  It was not the caliber of ""homemade"" we are used to when claimed by a restaurant.

Short handed on staff took to long for food to arrive  I wish I could remember our servers name, he was awesome!  I've enjoyed El Torito's many a time! So, to be fair, the review is not standard by any means. A friend recommended we meet there for breakfast, which we have done before. Unfortunately, on Sundays they only offer brunch. It is pricey, therefore we left.  I wish it was mentioned on the page or I wish I had looked into it. So, since I was asked for a review, I thought it might be helpful, if others can look into it, before going and being surprised. By the way, there regular breakfasts are reasonable.

I recommend making reservations as they do get busy.
Early is better and they have TVs in the bar for seasonal sports Read more Service was impeccable.  Same server always treats us great.    A bit noisy due  to a larger group  server apologized even though. She had no control.   Still enjoyed our brunch as always.   We were seated immediately and staff was very friendly.  When being seated and leaving, you will go up stairs through the bar area and then back down stairs to reach the dining room.  I did see a ramp on the other side in another dining area that wasn't being used.  The restaurant wasn't crowded on an early summer Saturday evening.  It was a nice touch that the manager came around to the tables to ask if everything was alright and thank us for coming.  It was also an indirect way of assisting the one server that was on staff.  As far as the food was concerned, it was fresh and tasted good.  We drove over 30 minutes to go to the restaurant, as we had been given a gift card.  I would say that had we not had the gift card, the food was not any better than other Mexican restaurants local to where we live to drive the extra distance.  It did appear that they have a Sunday morning buffet. Maybe we'll try that the next time, since we have a second gift card we received as a gift. Read more Our server Bailey I believe was super friendly and attentive  Welcome change to note that El Torito updated their menu and have discontinued the “surcharge “.
Excellent server, made us feel welcome. As did other staff.  Anytime we are in the mood for Mexican buffet we come here their brunch is so good and bottomless mimosas!  You have to try the menudo, taco bar and the delicious desserts.  The service was great, the brunch buffet dinner ware was dirty at all food stations. The dinner plates and bowls were dirty, washed yes, but partially cleaned; and present with dried food or partially dried foods from the previous users. The booth seats need to be cleaned better before utilization of other guests. Read more Outstanding Brunch! Would reccomend! Great kids buffet as well.  It was Father's Day so there were a lot of people which was appropriate.  The food was good overall.  The only issue was that I don't think they put out enough food for everyone and the buffet setup was too small for the amount of people that were there.  The flow buffet line was too slow and lots of waiting for the amount of time given for the buffet (it ended a 2pm).  We didn't get to try the tacos because it was too long of a wait, and we didn't get seated until 1pm (our reservations were for 12:30 and the buffet ended at 2 and I think they stopped refilling the food stations.  If the stations were spread out or if there were more stations it would have been better.  But the food was good and delicious.  Thank you! Read more Sunday bottomless mimosa brunch is amazing and a fantastic deal!  Great sunday brunch! Would recommend the food is so good very impressed  Always excellent food and drinks.

We discovered the bar with the shrimp, aguachiles, and ceviche this trip which was great. My only gripe or disappointment would be the drinks. The orange juice could be much better. I look forward to good OJ with breakfast/ brunch. The aguafrescas was watered down.  You might as well just have water with your meal if you want to be satisfied. The manager came to our table and sang happy birthday and made sure we were satisfied. They also accommodated our early arrival.

Had to wait over 45 minutes for my reservation which is unacceptable. They had buffet food in the check in area and it was totally not sanitary with people not even seated eating and drinking the food while they were waiting. The buffet lines were too long, had to wait and wait for food. They need to redesign the location of the food and experience. The only pleasant experience was the waiter. He was awesome. Older gentleman that knew how to handle his customers. Read more Pedro, our Waiter was very Engaging during Our Mother's Day B'fast!  Always a great meal. Sunday buffet is really great.

The food was just ok. My husband’s burger bun was very wet not very appetizing. My tri tip sandwich didn’t taste fresh, a bit dried out and not even warm.

Tried BJ for the first time over at La Mesa as we were headed to a concert and it was date night. We were seated right away however, waitress showed up after about 5 min, then said will be back. Then waited probably another 5 to 10 minutes when she returned she already had 2 waters. We ordered the Calamari appetizer, the spaghetti with meatballs and jambalaya with a house salad. The Spaghetti was ok, looked like the meatballs have been in the warmer too long as it was very dry. The jambalaya was a bit better however, the rice didn't seem throughly cooked as there were bits of hardness in them, wife was only able to eat about 1/4 of the spaghetti plate, i ate about half of the jambalaya. We then ordered dessert and got the pizookie trio since it was date night. Got the strawberry shortcake, cookies and cream and the chocolate chunk. Now, literally, the dessert took a while before it got served, probably what seemed to be about 10-15 min, it was ok, but what was disappointing was the ice cream was already melted halfway through when we got it. It was literally runny that my wife did't enjoy it much. I mean, it didn't really ruin date night for us but, would we go back there, probably not as we felt that it was underwhelming specially when we paid over $100 including tip. As soon as we left, my wife literally said that we should've went to Olive Gardens instead. Read more Always a great place for our family for a celebratory dinner, ending with a shared pizookie, of course.  Our server was amazing.  I am so sorry that I don’t recall his name, but he was great!  Drink service very slow. Bar area has much better service.

Can’t wait to be back again soon! Read more Enjoyed lunch choosing the $13 weekday lunch menu. The Strawberry salad, burger and Chicken, bacon ranch Piadina were all very good. The Mac and cheese balls were tasty too according to the 10yr old. Everything came out quickly. Staff very friendly and helpful.

Read more Made a reservation for a birthday dinner for 8 people for 6:30, we didn’t end up leaving until 9 after waiting an hour for food and 30 minutes for pizookies.

Server was really nice about it but probably won’t be coming back Read more Good was hot and done to perfection.

Salad served with no utensils  Read more Good order to a long time and one guests order was placed wrong  There were nine of us on a busy Saturday night. Lots of large parties. The food was overall good. They do impose an automatic 18% tip. I rated the service poor because the waits between ordering drinks and getting them, ordering food and getting it, asking for the check and receiving it, etc., were way too long. But I think they simply didn’t have enough staff. I felt sorry for our server. He and the others were busting their humps. So management, I hope you can add to your staff soon!

Only good part of the evening was the food was good when it finally arrived Read more Good quality food. Sports bar atmosphere. Fair value.  Absolutely horrible experience.  Service was terrible.  We had to keep asking for assistance such as water refills, drink refills.  Food was cold or meat uncooked.  Had to send back three meals because they were not cooked.  Some meals never came or were late arriving and cold when they did arrive.  Was over charged meals that we did not order.  Had to speak with two managers before we had our bill modified.  

Unbelievable.  I hope this is a one time incident.  From the looks of some reviews it is not.  No we will not be back. Read more The food took a long time to arrive, some of the food items were cold. Drinks came out fast. We didn’t get a kids menu until we placed our order (we didn’t even know they had any as we weren’t offered before). The clam chowder didn’t come with the bread bowl and we didn’t get an explanation (we very obviously ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl). The waiters seemed to be doing their best but seemed very overwhelmed and possibly understaffed in the kitchen. Wouldn’t return or recommend.

Overall, it was an okay experience, especially since we had to wait 45 minutes for our food, granted it was a Saturday evening but still that was a pretty substantial wait time.

The menu selection would good, the food was good.  The service was excellent. Would go back again.  Celebrated my son’s 16th bday with family.  Great dinner!  I've been coming to this restaurant for several years now and last night was a complete disappointment. They sat us down 40min past the reservation time and completely forgot our order. We had to wait for 45min for the food to arrive for a party of 2 adults and 2 kids. Once the food arrived, the tri tip was undercooked. My wife's hamburger was dry and looked like it had been cooked a while ago. And they forgot daughters food entirely,  even though it was just a bowl of soup.

They were half done by the time the 3rd person got their entree. 4th person got their entree when first 2 were done with their food. 2 rolls showed up somewhere in the middle, but 1 was deep fried and sat for a while, so it was just lukewarm and soggy.
Agedashi tofu needs rework. Restaurants are allowed some creative license, but it looked like little flat triangles of white bread scattered on a large plate with a bowl of sauce on the side. It should be big squares in a bowl with sauce and garnish; look up any of a dozen pictures. If the sauce is supposed to be controllable, serve it in a bowl with sauce on the side. Definitely not little tiny diagonal sandwich bread pieces though. Read more Unfortunately the fish did not seem fresh and the green ice tea had a distinct after taste. The server was nice and attentive, and the ambiance was ok. The music was very loud. We won’t be back  The rice in the rolls were not cooked all the way, found a hair on my dish upon eating, and another one in the ice cream birthday treat. Service was good though and tuna crispy rice was good.  The food was good, but the sushi service was very slow. They need another chef to keep up with the number of patrons. Our server was lovely, though. For sure we will be going back.  Mikey at the sushi bar is amazing. Had the best roll of my life.

Food was outstanding and service excellent plus it was a really attractive decor Read more Our server was great, and the food was delicious. My only complaint was the risotto wasn’t to my or my mom’s liking. It just had an off flavor. I thought it was too much pepper, but others who tasted it thought it had too much garlic. Either way, our server was quick to offer another option, like scalloped potatoes. I opted for the green beans instead, as did my mom. I appreciated the the manager was quick to check on us as well and even offered a dessert to compensate. I would definitely return. Read more We loved our food snd cocktails! We were visiting from out of town and we’ll definitely make a point to come back here on our next visit.  Read more Nice dinner  We had a wonderful dinner last night at the Bluewater Grill.

A lively atmosphere and great food. We sat at the bar and had a good time watching everything going on.  A good lunch. The cedar plank salmon was pretty good, as was the prawn linguini lunch special. The restaurant was clean and not busy or loud.

The service was rough. I had made a reservation a few days ahead on Opentable for lunch, and when we arrived they had no record of it. At least as stated, it wasn’t busy.

Service was at a snail’s pace to start. It was close to 20 minutes before anyone even came over with water.

That said, once everything was ordered, food came out relatively quickly and drinks were constantly refilled. And the waitress was very friendly and did a great job explaining the menu.

At the end, my friend and I wanted to split the check and gave the waitress two cards. She charged my friend’s card twice. For such a common thing at a restaurant, that was unexpectedly poor. I guess that’s what Venmo exists for though!

Would come back for the food, but hopefully the service gets cleaned up a bit. Read more I was appreciative of the fact that they happily moved us to outdoor seating after seating us indoors. Inside the restaurant, the noise level was high. Outdoors it was way more mellow, except when the train rushed by just a few hundred feet away.

Service was attentive, meals came quickly and were tasty.  Service is always very good at these restaurants, and this day was no different. 
Had two appetizers and neither had any flavor at all. In past both have been great, but Kung Pao brussels were soggy and flavorless. Veggie eggrolls were also greasy and tasteless. 
I ordered the shrimp Kung Pao, one of my go to favorites and the shrimp were also soggy, greasy and the dish flavorless. 
The restaurant was almost empty during the lunch hour on a Friday, so really made me wonder after if I was the last to figure out the place has gone downhill or the kitchen is poorly managed and chef's not trained properly.

Our server was very short with us & unfriendly, never refilled our drinks once, we had to ask for Togo containers 4 times, never came by to see if we needed anything, cleared the table before everyone at the table was done eating, forcing us to rush our $200+ meal & to top it off, circled the 20% suggested gratuity on the receipt as if she was entitled to it after the horrible service.

Nice menu with lots of great options. Ordered, halibut sandwich that was amazing, steak salad, cooked to perfection and delicious, salmon, delicious, and cioppino., delicious again. The only thing lacking was good service. Brought a second glass of wine and the dirty glass was left, disappeared at times. Oh, I was out talking to a friend. Just very lackadaisical for such a lovely place and meal. 
I mentioned three times I was cold, nothing. Fourth mention, the server said, oh we have blankets! Would have been nice to have known an hour earlier. Nice touch, if you know about them. Someone who we assumed was the manager stopped by everyone’s table to say hello and ask how the food was.

Asked for a table outside and the hostess seated us at the side. Not the greatest but it was the only tables available. A customer came in right after us and someone had vacated a table at beach side which the hostess gave to said customer. Since no one had come to wait on us she should have asked if we wanted that table. Totally unprofessional.

Server came with water and after a long period of time she came back and I asked for a cocktail list again after a lengthy time another server brought the list. No one ever came back so because our time and money is precious to us we left

Will never return Read more Service was great, the burgers & chicken sandwiches are very good. Sometime in the last 2 weeks chandler's has reduced the portion size of the beet salad by half.

Then we split the Maui Chicken Pineapple bowl and it was perfect just like at the Fair. She tried to talk us into the fried Oreo dessert but we were stuffed. The value for the price was perfect and we will definitely be back again. Read more Enjoyed our food and experience. Our server was awesome.  The shrimp were really good! And the service was great!  I had been to this location when it was an elegant restaurant, though I knew this would be less formal. What I wasn’t expecting was the horrible acoustics and very loud bar area when you first walk in. Even though there were only a few patrons at the Bar, the noise was overwhelming. There was no host/hostess at the hostess stand, and we waited a few minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant. We were advised to seat ourselves and chose the furthest table away from the bar with the hopes of being able to have conversation.  It was better, but the bar was still very noisy. The service was okay, and the food was l pretty good. We had the fish and chips and spring salad with crispy chicken. The coating used on both was very good, good flavor, good coverage. The chicken remained juicy inside which I appreciated. The tater tots were a nice option and very good. Read more Amazing! Everything was wonderful from the beginning to the end food and service !  The special for the day was excellent.
Server from Carvers was exceptional.  My third time back in two months. Love the chicken.  Chicken Charlie’s is one of mine and my family’s favorite places to go. The person who took care of us did a great job, the food was absolutely delicious, and we know for sure that we will be dining again in the future! ￼ Read more Read more Great recommendation from a friend. Excellent chicken, fish and salad. Large portions.  The pancakes are tasty and the food preparation was good. Disappointed that the menu doesn’t include any creative omelettes or scrambles with veggies. Very surprised they do not have decaf coffee or non dairy creamer. The wait staff were not engaged and didn’t offer refills on tea or water or offer jam for toast. Had to flag down the waitress a couple times and the restaurant was pretty empty. Overall a fine experience but I don’t think I’ll go back due to lack of our preferred breakfast offerings. Read more Overall it was a good experience and we will be back, they make a killer old fashioned and for small bar they have a good selection of quality spirits and wine. The food was good quality and the shrimp is outstanding the ribs were very very cooked and tender (although the sauce isn’t my favorite so I’ll ask for naked next time). Our sever and bar tender was awesome. A cool little casual neighbourhood spot. Read more Excellent food and service. Very friendly staff. Highly recommend.  Food was great, all of the staff were super nice and accommodating, and I even got to meet Charlie! He loved my green eyes. Lol. ￼  Great experience for a business lunch with unusual food like the chicken teriyaki inside the pineapple.  Love it! I would love to go back there again with my dog!  service was friendly and inviting.  loaded fries were good price and very tasty. would definitely order again.  fish and chips (tater tots) were good but prefer the more traditional batter vs the thick crispy batter. Read more It was a great time, with yummy food. Couldn’t ask for better service.  Definitely, will be doing this spot again.  Don’t ever eat there.. the food was horrible. I had short curly hair cooked in my Mac n cheese. I would never recommend this restaurant.  Read more We decided to dine here today because it is one of my grandma’s favorite places. Overall, we had a great experience. There are one or two things that could’ve gone a little bit better. First of all, the person who waited on us had a little bit of attitude that was negative, and came back about 20 minutes after we were ready for our order to be done 15 minutes ago. For the most part, the food was delicious, but the salad my mom had was not that great. It looked like there were parts of it that were burned Whether it was the lettuce or chicken. We probably will come back again at some point in the future. ￼ Read more The food was great.  Shrimp and lobster were cooked perfectly.  Our server was terrific  - she was really helpful.  The only negative was that I was in the mood for frogs' legs and they were out. Read more This is a great place for groups. The server let us split checks and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. It was a great experience..I would gladly come back.  Loved our waiter!

We enjoyed all the dishes immensely and highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Great food! Delicious! Service was a tad slow. Ambiance is nice. Love the place!  Very kind servíce and food was tasty!
Every dish we had or shared was delightful and abundant.  We love the new menu. It still has some of the previous favorites, and the additions are great! We go a few times a year and it is always great fresh food and friendly service.  Great environment for drinks, they were out of many dishes. What we ordered was not so great for the value.  Quite disappointing.  There were 2 entrees on the menu which we planned to share.  Turned out both of those were discontinued. They need to update the website menu and the printed menus.  We settled for something else that was just average. Read more Great overall experience! Food , ambiance, great customer service. Got the Tomahawk and salmon really good  .

The town of Temecula is lovely. Small Barn sits it a wonderful spot on the Main Street of the town. The ambiance does not disappoint .   The waitstaff treated us kindly and gave us wonderful recommendations for the rest of the day. My disappointment is that at 10:30 in the morning they had sold out of menu items. I would think a restaurant that advertised brunch would be prepared for service beyond the first 30 minutes of the day. I did enjoy the mimosa. Read more Read more This place is absolutely amazing.   Quick shout out to Andy for being an incredible server.

If you are a real fan of food and creativity…make a reservation.  The executive chef’s creativity with ingredients and styles or presentation are absolutely refreshing and delicious.  And the ambiance is inviting and the music is upbeat but subtle so you feel active and engaged while enjoying incredible food.

Get the scallops.  So stupidly good!
Get the Rack of Lamb if it’s on the menu!

Chocolate Chip Cookie for desert will blow your mind. Read more For some reason, something was off last night.  Service was subpar, food was just ok. A lot of food items on the menu were out of stock and we couldn’t order what menu items we wanted. We were excited to take some out of town family members and it was too bad it wasn’t a better experience. We’ve never experienced this before when we’ve dined here so I’ll chalk it up to an off night. Very disappointing. Read more Fantastic, as always. We loved our server Selena, she’s awesome. I always come here when visiting Temecula.  This is a lovely restaurant with three areas to gather. We sat outdoor under a covered patio. E made reservations for brunch and were seated immediately with menus. After 20 minutes we had to ask for a server to come. The hostess delivered water and told us one would be coming. Another table had sat down next to us and only been there 5 min. The server went there and took their order. Seems to be confusion in the system of servers. All were pleasant but we were 4 adults and 2 children and this was not a good experience. Orders were taken 35 minutes after arrival. Food came in normal time and had good variety and taste. Read more The typical becomes atypical. Even the commomplace Brussel Sprouts and French Fries get dressed up in a new and exciting way. Presentation was excellent, right down to the stoneware dishes, never asked for bone handled steak knives, and unusual water bottles. Meats were tender and delicious, and the sides were special. Ambience was casual-cool, the establishment was beautifully lit after the sun set, the servers knew their stuff and were happy to be there, and management was attentive and kind.
A five star experience if ever there was one in Temecula. Thank you, Small Barn! Read more Croque madame was in over-cooked.
Service was excellent. Wish I had ordered something different.  Excellent food and service! We came here with a party of 8 late on a Thursday in September. I was very surprised how empty the restaurant was, but nothing disappointed. The heaters kept us warm and the food and drinks were delicious.our server was very attentive and we had a great night. Would definitely go back again. Read more Always a great experience and great service! Great food and cocktails too. This will continue to be my favorite restaurant in town.  For the price, the steak was low quality and chewy.  Not worth it.  The Croque Madam was over toasted.  The only thing that was worth it was the drink and tuna appetizer.  Thunder was expected so no outside seating the night we dined there. No problem as the inside was cozy and comfortable. Burger, salmon, lamb chops and cheesy potato’s were all very good. Our waitress was super nice and my daughter got cookies and ice cream for her birthday treat. I hope to make it for breakfast on the weekend some time. Read more Read more Came here with a large group. Service was fanrastic, food was pretty good, kinda pricey, but overall a great evening. Would definitely go back next time we’re in town.  Overall a complete miss and sadly very disappointing.

Service was full of mistakes. Took over 15 mins for server to come take our food order after we sat down. Also she came over after our appetizers came out and told us it was “last call at the bar”

It was 8pm. I’ve never in my life had a restaurant say that to me.

Food was underwhelming. Presentation was sloppy. We ordered crudo and baked feta which were both drowning in sauce it made it borderline inedible.

Entrees were something out of a hello fresh box.
No one came to clear our appetizer plates and the food runner who delivered our entrees pushed the plates to the center of the table and said “have a great night”

Drinks were bad I couldn’t even finish the passion fruit margarita that I was rushed to get and took 15 mins to come out.

Menu has a bit of an identity crisis and trying too hard to be fancy. Read more Nice location vibe and great food choices for lunch   Just need bigger sign outside   Both people in our party walked around entire block passing restaurant  before realizing we had arrived
Sign small behind gate/ bush
Otherwise  liked everything Read more Awesome food as always. Ambiance is excellent. The only downside to this restaurant is the price. It is expensive. The average person or someone on a budget cannot afford to eat here. Read more What a lovely place with excellent food! Old Towne is moving up in the world.  I’ve been here before and loved it.  This visit they sat us outside under the covered patio again but this time we were smashed up against the outside wall of the restaurant in a tiny 2 top table, right under the speaker. Not a great experience this time.  However, our server was amazing & the food was good. My husband really liked his steak & eggs. I tried the Croque Madame… too much bread for me.  But the flavor was good.
Next time we’ll ask for a 4 top & maybe try sitting inside for a change.  Looks like a good bar inside. Read more Love the ambiance and energy here. Food was phenomenal and portions are huge. We (3of us)  shared one entree and 2 appetizers and it was too much lol  Food and services great!  We got smash burgers and fries and beer.  First time here over the weekend and was not disappointed.  Two of my friends and I shared the wagyu tomahawk and is was delicious.  We also ordered the brussels and mushroom, both really good and the sauce on the mushrooms was delicious.  We also ordered the potato gratin side but it was a small portion which normally I feel if the entree doesn't come with a side that the sides should be a sharable portion side, but that's just me.  Still delicious.  I was given free birthday milk and cookies warm and gooey with whip and strawberries.  They service it with a horchata like milk, but its the texture of mexican champurrado.  I love champurrado so I enjoyed it, but my friend wasn't fond of the texture so to each his own.

I def say it's worth checking out for the ambiance and food.  I would love to go back and try the sea bass next time. Read more My husband and I got the strawberry salad, broiled feta and honey, and the burgers and Parmesan fries. It was all delicious! The vegetables were all so incredibly fresh! Also, one of the best juicy burgers ever- the mayo/sauce stuff mixed with the fat from the burger and made the most amazingly juicy burger.

And the foods are different from the menu on the app. For those who want something quick like pizza or looking for an atmosphere to drink, this is good.  The advertising for this restaurant is not appropriate- 
It is a casual walk in pizza place that has not been properly renovated since the 80's.  there are holes in the floor, the bathroom has graffiti in it? We walked like 7 blocks- passing much more pleasant places.  Their logo- is awful, the name of the restaurant isn't clear and looks like an old arcade building.  It doesn't feel clean at all-the food was actually fresh and good and the waitress was a doll, however one of the other girls were wearing a bustier without a jacket?  It was very inapporpriate and uncomfortable.  
They shouldnt even offer a reservation- we were given paper plates too where the food in the pics looks like gormet? So strange- a place we will talk about for a long time.  Hope the owners listen to this advice- you have great food and staff.  You need to really clean and update things if you want to be worthy of a reservation.

Read more We’ve dined many times at our favorite North County Gastro pub. I’m happy to report, they are back of their previous level of excellence in food, ambience, and service. I had their gumbo which was expertly seasoned. My wife had the shrimp and grits, her perennial favorite, which remains excellent. Service by Rachel Was spot on, friendly and punctual. This is a classic North County Gastro pub, I frequently bring out of town friends to get a sense for a classic San Diego eatery. Highly recommended. ￼ Read more Dropped in for a couple of Pacific's and and the ahi poke nachos - food was great, beer was good and cold and our server (Nick at the bar) was outstanding.

We had the flatbreads.  But the star was the Creole Shrimp appetizer.  That was excellent.  Alec, our server was awesome!!!  Great lunch with colleagues. Service was fantastic - very attentive. Everyone enjoyed their food & drinks. I had the vegan burger, but on the regular burger's brioche bread. It was SO good, and I actually thought I was eating meat at first. I would definitely get it again. Read more Still love this restaurant but we did have a few issues: seated right away but extremely long time before a server approached; one of our entrees was incorrect so it had to be returned and made again (price deducted from bill); and shrimp & grits though delicious was too salty. Read more I had not been to Union Kitchen in Encinitas for a couple of years.  Took a friend there on Saturday and liked the vibe so much I took my wife the next day.  I love the setting and the energy.  Bloody's were good and the food was good too - nothing amazing, but really good.  The prices are pretty steep with shrimp and grits at $28, side of fries $9, etc.  We'll definitely come back for drinks and ambience, but the food needs to be either more special or not as expensive - there are many other competitive choices in the area.  Thanks for the great service. Read more Good food and great service. We will be back! Thank you.  We used to come here way back in the beginning years ago when it first opened, and it was a fun lively place with good food. It has gone way downhill over the years: Terrible service. Our server forgot about us several times. In fact, it took almost 20 minutes for her to even get to our table to take her drink order and all we were getting was water. We felt bad she was so busy. It’s very loud in there, but it is a bar atmosphere so that’s to be expected. The food was awful. Overly flavored, heavy on the sauces, but I suppose that’s also typical of a bar. Read more Great food, drinks and staff--a local jewel! Steak frites and OG burger are the best.

Also, WOW they raised prices or something? $200 pre-tip for a family of 3 with no alcohol or appetizers. Ok if you’re going to charge that much but then clean it up. Don’t let the floor be so greasy that the chairs slide around. Put away the wet floor sign and the rags on the floor soaking up a leak. Don’t have dirty plates on the table needing to be replaced when seated. And serve Coke instead of Pepsi. Read more Work party.  Had kids 9-13 there too.  They were mesmerized.  Great experience.  Our chef (Daniel) was very personable and cooked our food perfectly. The best deal was adding scallops to my meal for $12.50. The way the scallops were cooked was the “topper” for my meal. My daughter ordered the Yakisoba and said it was the best she ever tasted. Thank you everyone. Read more Our table's chef was Daniel. He hardly used any oil for the grill dishes, which caused all the food to burn quickly, and he placed other ingredients on top of the charred remains, leaving everything covered in ash. The fried rice wasn't stir-fried well, so we ended up eating plain white rice. While the group next to us received a large portion of fried rice, we got a small serving that barely filled one bowl. While his talking with other guests at the table, we noticed that the meat we ordered was overcooked, leaving it dry and tasteless. It was truly the worst chef.

The group next to us was already enjoying their food, but we had to wait longer for ours because one person in that group had a shrimp allergy, so he cooked shrimp dishes last. As a result, our family had to wait the longest for the main dish.

The server also treated our family differently. There was someone celebrating a birthday in the adjacent group, and my wife was celebrating her birthday too, yet the server gave ice cream to everyone in that group but only to my wife in ours. This was clearly racial discrimination. When my wife asked for an extra spoon so the kids could share, we were only given one spoon. My wife said it was truly the worst birthday ever. Read more Floor is slippery from cooking oil. The food quality was fair. Too loud. $100 for two people. Not returning.  Everything is ok untilhe cooked my scallops, RAW and still fishy!  I’ve been to other Benihanas and it was great this was my first time at this one made a reservation for 8:15 didn’t get sat until almost 8:30. Not to mention the hostess kept going right outside the front door where the entrance is and vaping right there. Then it took a server almost 10 minutes to greet us we got our soup salad and appetizers before we reminded the server we didn’t have our drinks yet. The chef was great and funny and put on a show for us and the food was great but after the chef left it took a while for us to get the server back over so we could get the check and to go boxes. The food and chef were great everything else not so much. Read more Carly was the best bartender ever! Give her a raise!  Bad food quality, came very late. Chef looked tired, dropped the knife and broke a bowl  Read more We had a great experience here tonight celebrating a birthday and enjoying well prepared food. Everything was just delicious. We love this place.  I think our server was waiting to leave.   He did not do any of the fun stuff like flip the shrimp or make the fried rice look cool.  He cooked and only did the onion volcano,  Nothing else.  We ended up at a table with just the two of us, but that's not a reason not to do the show that I paid for at Benihanas.  Also, it was not his fault, but half my meal was missing, and I had to ask for my scallops.  The kitchen had not included them when they sent his cart out, and he did not check like they usually do.  From sitting down to the chef leaving the table after cleaning the grill was about 15 minutes.  We were there at 8:45, so not super close to closing.

Have a blessed week Read more We checked in about 2 minutes before our 7:00 pm reservation. We waited about 15 minutes then asked when our table would be ready. We were then told that it would be about 1.5 hours! I understand that things happen but why didn’t anyone inform us of the wait when we checked in? What is the point of making a reservation? We were there with my 3 year old couldn’t wait that long so we had to leave. Read more We celebrated my mom's bday and was such a fun time. Our chef, Ray, was awesome and so funny! Didn't realize it was Restaurant Week and Benihana had a special that showcased my favorite meal, but also included the chicken fried rice and an appetizer. So good, so yummy, and mom had a blast!! Read more It was a great experience, it was for my Birthday. Good food. Nice staff.  We go here for all our birthdays and special occasions.  The steak is some of the best in CA.  The chef's are fun and funny and it is always a good memory for us!  This location is one of the best and very consistent in quality and entertainment value. Read more Service was terrible. We literally were ignored the whole time by our waitress and staff  Just a note, happy hours have changed at this location to 3-6 pm, instead of 4-7 pm so we missed happy hour which we usually do begore dinner. As always, this place is a lot of fun, it is getting a bit pricy, but the food is good and our chef Nick made if a very enjoyable experience, would love it if we could get him every time!

Read more Once our chef arrived we had a good time and the food was great. However our reservation was for 6:30, we weren’t seated until after 6:45, and the chef didn’t make his way over to our teppan seating area until 7:45. Long wait for a birthday dinner that had been noted on the reservation. They also forgot one of our sushi rolls that had been ordered so we just did without it. Overall good, but maybe short- staffed Read more We ordered the hibachi steak and shrimp dinner . The steak was full of grizzle! We had to wait too long for our chef to come to our grill.  It's everything you would expect from Benihana. Entertainment, attentiveness, great food, and professionalism.  Really feel like I should have bought Disney tickets with the same money. Didn't really feel like it was a value  Lesson learned.  We had a fun time. Chef Aries was amazing! Pricey, but paying for an experience as well as good food.  Always a great time coming here. Family has been celebrating birthdays here for over 15 years .  David was great. So was our server. She was kind and attentive  We shared our table with a lovely family. Our chef was very engaging and had hilarious jokes. He was very kind to the children at the table. Our chef was very attentive to our dietary restrictions with my daughter, being a vegetarian  . Our server was very attentive as well and was quick to respond to anything we needed refilled or package to go.  It was such a great experience ￼ Read more We went for a birthday, we have a 5 yo myself and my wife. It was really nice and the show helped keep my daughter’s attention. It was a bit pricey but the food is a lot so it’s good. I didn’t order the fried rice and regretted it a little since fried rice is part of the show. We only had 3 and the other party was five so we were the small group. It was a lot longer than I planned total time for dinner was 2.5 hours from the time of our reservation. This included  longer wait time to be seated. I think I would go back - highlights were my daughter who was really into the onion volcano and our server and chef were nice just didn’t know the Benihana way and it was the first time there so I wish I would have got some more background. The place is really nice but it was a little hot inside. Overall fun time. Read more The service at Carlsbad Benihana was good. We ordered 2 sets or chicken wing appetizers they were both cold which leads me to believe that they do not make them fresh - but reheat. They did comp us one set which was nice. The show was ust OK. They asked if it was a special occasion which it was our 42 wedding anniversary but they did not do anything or acknowledge it.

I’ve been many times before, and have always had such a great time. However, this time around has truly had me question if it was worth returning. We made reservations for prime rib night, and understandably they sold out. We opted for porterhouse-the manager comes to our table 20 minutes after we’ve already ordered to tell us that they’ve ran out. Waiting 20-30 minutes for each round of drinks… not worth it. Read more Our server Isiah was outstanding and we had a wonderful time!  The hostess wasn't dressed appropriately for the restaurants environment and wasn't very friendly. We were offered the Tomahawk special, but by the time our waiter came back to take our order the only 1 for the night had already been ordered. Was bummed and had to shift gears.

The included salad was disappointing but I upgraded one of our salads to the wedge and was enough for two. It was $9 extra but worth the extra cost as it was pretty good. I believe the steak was a sirloin based on shape and taste. It was cooked perfectly and flavorful. Lobster also cooked well and not overcooked like many lobster specials are. Good desert. A solid 4 for me which means the food and service were really good and if I come back to Sycuan I would dine there again. Read more Delicious steaks, great drinks, and great service!

Sooooo good!!! Great date night! Beautiful setting , with candles and sounds from a piano. Oh and the food was DE-lish!! Highly recommend the Surf & Turf!  The F&B director came out. I attempted to let him know that the last 3 times we’ve been in they were out of what we ordered. He didn’t hear me because he wouldn’t let me talk. He’s a heavyset guy named Daniel. He was extremely rude and all that we could get to the table in 30 minutes was the free bread they give, the drinks never came. He did let me know the time they ran out last week and so on. We were staying in the hotel for 4 days last week, same. Tonight we left. I know people that work here, what I experienced is normal. The employees are treated like crap so I guess we got the same treatment. I’ll be emailing the resort as well. I’m sure they don’t care just their employees. We would come here more but Sycuan and their food and beverage has been going downhill for years. I have diabetes and had taken my meds thinking I’d get a good meal served to me. That wasn’t the case. We gambled and had food at home later. Each steak runs around an average of $50+. We usually spend around $300 after apps and sides. Tonight we just left. We won’t be back. The food at Sycuan is a ripoff. Daniel did a horrible job once we asked for a manager. What a waste of time. Read more We ordered the Slab bacon, was so juicy and amazing.

We had excellent service even though it was a busy holiday weekend and the food was delicious! My steak was cooked perfectly!  Food was not cooked to specs. No soda refill.

Great Bloody Mary too!  One of our favorite spots. Today was a very nice relaxing experience and the food was great as always. I do wish they had more (healthy) options on the menu. There seem to be less every time I’m there. Read more This was our first time at Cork Fire. The service and food were outstanding. I suggest you get the Brussel sprouts and bread pudding with extra caramel sauce.  Our group of 4 dined on Saturday night. The restaurant is in a nice cabin style building. The ambience is quiet and classy. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience with our food taste and quality. We ordered a salad and patatas bravas for appetizer and both were tasty. However, our main dishes were all aweful. I ordered the tagliatelle pasta. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I drenched it in salt and pepper to try to make it edible but it did not help. Another person ordered the Risotto. The dish was made with curry and it could have been a great tasting dish but it was like they had thrown the entire bottle of curry on the food. It was so strong and overpowering that it made you cough. Finally, the last two ordered the Halibut. One of the worst fish I have ever tasted. There was absolutely no flavor. They put a bit of dried chinichurri sauce on top but it couldn’t help the extreme blandness of the fish. In addition to the lack of flavor, the consistency of the fish was like it had been frozen and they through it in the microwave. It was overcooked; chewy and mushy at the same time. This was a $50 plus plate. Our group kept debating whether or not to tell the server and we tried to eat the meals because we were starving but in the end we had to tell her. It was just that bad. The server was very apologetic and spoke to the manager. The server later returned to say they would give us a 50% discount on the main entrees. We accepted the offer, although honestly, they food was worth absolutely nothing. Last but not least, my husband ordered a margarita and he didn’t drink it because the taste was also watered down. We did not mention the drink to the server. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. For the prices you would think they would have a top chef but unfortunately, my kids can make a better dinner. Read more Excellent evening at Cork Fire Kitchen.

Food, service, lighting… it was all 5 star quality.  I had the beef short ribs, which was a substitute for the lamb shank, and it was exquisite.  The meat was tender and the sauce added unctuous depth of flavor.  The wife had scallops which were delicate and succulent.  Also, they serve a killer Bloody Mary! Read more Four of us went out for a birthday dinner last night at Cork Fire. I had requested a dining room table which we were seated at. The service was very nice. The menu was quite limited - we were hard pressed to find something that we wanted to order. Most entrees were the same price. The short rib was basically just meat with sauce on a dish. A vegetable or two would have been appreciated. The other couple enjoyed their entrees. The noise level was a little too loud and it made it nearly impossible to have a conversation.

Too greasy..  We arrived for our reservation a few minutes early. We checked in with the hostess, she said it would be a minute so I went to the restroom. When I can back I asked how much longer. She said it would be a minute. Not even checking my name. She then had to asked me again for my name. Kind of rude. We got seated at a nice soft banquet/bench table. The seat hadn’t been wiped off. So I quickly did it with my hand since there were crumbs all over. Our waiter comes over (after about 5-10minutes) and I wasn’t sure if he was the bus boy since he was filling our water glasses until he asked what we wanted to drink. I asked about the specialty drinks then ordered the “To the Victor goes the Spoils”. It taste like a dreamsicle. It is only a half size drink. Still really yummy. My husband has the fauxtail that was spicy. It was very pineapple forward with a nice spicy finish. I ordered the burger. It was juicy and cooked perfect. It had really good toppings. The fries that came with it were nice and crispy but rubbery. It was so weird that I ate a couple to check. Not good. My husband got the fish and chips. When he saw it (3 pieces of fish strips) he thought he was going to be hungry after. He also got the house made chips. They lacked any real flavor. My water went empty and we had to do some major flagging down to get 1 refill. We asked for the check when we finally got the refill and it was another 5 minutes before it arrived. The restaurant was not busy today. We have tried the food at a chef’s speciality dinner and winery event before and it was really good. Just a little disappointed with everything today.

Our waiter wasn’t very attentive and the hostess forgot my husbands birthday - so we just left  Vigilucci’s never disappoints! There are 3 Vigilucci’s Restaurants in the area and the Trattoria is my favorite of the three locations, as it’s a little less “stuffy” than the other two.

The food is all house-made and fresh to order. I’ve never had less than excellent service, and their portions are actually very generous for the prices.

If you’re there for supper and they have a seafood special such as Halibut, do yourself a favor and order that! It’s always amazing.

I have never found a single fault with my food or experience. Read more Excellent food and service. Accomodated out large party of 13 with a private space that had a big screen tv for us watch the Padre game in the background  The food and service was awesome. Love visiting this spot. Thanks Crew  Good service classic Italian food well presented  We have been here off and on over many years. The food is not good. I couldn’t even eat my eggplant parmigiana because it was extremely salty and cheesy. When the waitress came and asked how our food was I said not good. I don’t like this. At that point I did not want to order anything else and she said she would take the meal off my check. Later she came back and told me her boss said they were just offering us a free dessert. I negotiated a 50% discount on my meal and went home hungry. Too bad because this was supposed to be a date with my husband. I need to remember not to go back. Read more I’ve been Vigiluccis’s over 120 times over the years. I like this particular location. The food is good. The service is generally good. (sometimes a bit variable). Hope to be back another 120 times at least! Read more We went at 6:30 p.m. the restaurant was lightly filled, the food was outstanding as usual; but the service was poor, mentioned it to the owner and he simply stated that they were busy....usually the service is fine.............hopefully a one time thing.  When signed up, it was a special occasion my birthday, which they seemed unaware.......so nothing special there. Read more Read more This was the most delicious dinner that I’ve had all year. I had the minestrone soup and wife started with the caprese. They were both delicious. Our main courses were Scaloppine Funghi Porcini and Melanzana ( Eggplant) Alla Parmigiana. They were both fantastic. They also comped a cannolo for dessert for our anniversary.
Overall it was s wonderful dinner. Read more Our favorite Italian restaurant in North County. Great menu choices from Risotto to Lasagna to outstanding seafood choices. Interesting specials that are very creative.  Another excellent meal at Vigiluccis! I dined in the bar with Amy who always takes great care of her customers. I had a perfect Martini with a Caesar salad followed by Penne Ala Vodka with sausage. Amy picked a fantastic Super Tuscan to pair with my pasta-Delicious! Once again, Vigiluccis has demonstrated why they are my favorite restaurant on the planet. Every time I visit Encinitas from Phoenix I go and will be back in a couple of months. Read more The food is always delicious. I wish I could remember our servers name, a very tall gentleman, was incredible. We had a group of young children with us and he was extremely patient. Live music makes for a great ambience. This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the area. Read more The restaurant consistently offers good food and a pleasant atmosphere. The music in the dining room and bar is always enjoyable, yet quiet enough for conversation. The bar is an excellent spot for drinks, dining, or waiting for your table. We visit often. Read more Great food and service as always. Ordered the special seafood pasta. Very good.  We frequently come to this restaurant because we have always had great service and excellent food!  Last night we were there for my birthday,  service was terrible! It took 20 minutes to even get water! Then it took a long time to get our drinks. Our appetizer which is usually a must was not as tasty, and smaller portions. Our server was no where to be found when we needed more water 😡  Our dinners were ok. My sisters Chicken Parm was burnt, my Lasagna was lukewarm and my husband’s was fine but again portions were noticeably smaller and a raise in prices as well. I understand the raise in prices but anyway. They just brought me a cannoli for my birthday dessert without even asking if I wanted that or something else. I don’t care for cannoli.  Ok enough complaining!
Not to sure if we will be back anytime soon! Read more We had a very nice dinner and great service. We plan to go back more often.  Always good food and service. Great menu. Lovely restaurant.

Our server was awesome and the food came out quickly. Everything we ordered was great with good portion sizes. Definitely recommend! Read more Ambiance, service and drinks were all great. Food presentation was excellent. Servings were a little small for price. Overall good experience.  Delicious food! Salmon is stellar!! Great ambience!  It was chilly although I enjoyed the doors open.  Very yummy and seamless service!  I had the green chile enchiladas and I really enjoyed them. My friend had a fish taco. The taco was bland and no sauce. The drinks are always so good.  We sat at the Baja outdoor area upstairs. The ceviche was the best we ever had and the mole salmon was fantastic. The waiter was friendly and service in general very good. Would highly recommend. Read more Overall, food quality was not worth the price, although there were a few things here and there that were pretty good (Chile mango margarita!). We were seated inside near a party of 10, so it was pretty loud. Read more Our party of 8 all enjoyed their food!! Service was great & a lovely ambiance!!  We were visiting Carlsbad for a few days & I picked this place on line. What a great choice! The menu is a Mexican & S. American fusion. Everything about this restaurant is fabulous: Service, Food, Decor, Ambience! Even the bathrooms are fabulous! It has 2 patios for outdoor dining and the bar was very nice too. Plenty of seating in the bar! I highly recommend it! Read more Order the black bean dip. Your tastebuds will thank you.  Read more Our server was wonderful. Unfortunately the food didn’t taste as good as I’d hoped looking at the reviews. Their guac lacked flavor and their chips were nothing special considering they make them in house. Read more Food was decent but overpriced.  Not worth the drive to Carlsbad  Had a great experience at this restaurant and would highly recommend it!! The service was very prompt and our waiter, John D. was awesome. He had. A lot of energy and was so quick in taking care of us and recommending a great dish. The special was a lamb chop plate with a sweet potato squash, with black rice!! I would give it a 10/10 and come back again. Read more Great space and good food. The brunch menu is smaller and the restaurant was not crowded since we had a reservation before eleven.  Service was amazing! Drinks could have been better, prices a bit higher than what they should have been.  Only four stars because the food took a long time to come out both times we’ve been here.  Very slow and it wasn’t crowded at all. Service and food were great.  I’ve been here multiple times before however I’ve sit in the bar area when I do. They have amazing cocktails and the food is phenomenal. I went here to celebrate my birthday with my family. I had made the reservation for the Baja patio, & was not seated there, however didn’t say anything as I figured a table is a table. However we proceeded to  have the worst service I think I’ve ever had. We sat for 20 minutes before having to go to the host stand to ask for service. When finally greeted we were told our server was “dealing with something” so the server there would be helping us for the night. Food & drinks came pretty quick and was AMAZING! But that was literally the only positive about the whole experience. Our table was never cleared, we sat in a pile of dirty dishes while we waited for our check & to pay. We waited quite some time to even pay to the point where we set a timer & were ready to just leave- something I have NEVER DONE. In looking around every other table was cleaned and kept up and the server spent plenty of time with them. I realize this sounds like an “our party” problem but we are very polite & understanding as we’ve all worked in restaurants before. We  go out frequently & have literally never experienced this before, it’s mind boggling. I’ll probably go back and sit at the bar area again as like I said, the product is amazing but definitely wouldn’t recommend for any kind of dinner party. Read more We sat outside, so there was very little noise level. If you make a reservation you can ask for a table on the south side of the restaurant to avoid sitting on the parking lot but it wasn't bad. The food was delicious and the server pointed out that they have changed their menu to accommodate people who aren't looking to spend an arm and a leg (can get indiv tacos now and a drink for dinner and they don't care). Carlsbad is so expensive now, so that is a nice addition. Server was hilarious and very good. Read more Best Mexican food in San Diego. Amazing happy hour.  Service, food & ambience was excellent!

I have a friend who lives in Oceanside. This place is right on the boarder between O-side and CB.
We were meeting with family. 2 of which I had not seen since Covid. We lingered and laughed our waitress was so lovely. I had the avocado tostada with 2 eggs on the brunch menu, and a Blackberry Aperol Spritz, my husband had the Chili Quiles, my husband said the meat was so tender like filet mignon, Acai bowl was order by another family member and my Auntie had the tortilla soup! We will definitely go back! Read more We have appreciate their quality and variety offerings.  Our last visit for lunch the 4 of us all ordered different things and thought all we great.  We have thoroughly enjoyed all our meals at Fresco Cocina. Read more We are vegetarian.  The tortilla chips are fried in beef tallow.  I don’t understand why they don’t just use another oil so everyone can enjoy nachos.  I brought my girlfriend here for the first time and the food and drinks were great. I think the cost of Caesar w/ chicken salad was a bit extreme but it was very food. My friend ordered the tinga tacos and the flavor was fabulous. The ambience is beautifully done. I absolutely love the pink leather chairs in the bar area. Read more Service was great. Ambiance also equally great. Margaritas quite tasty. The food was mediocre. That was disappointing  This was our third visit to Fresco Cocina and it did not disappoint. There was a lively crowd but we were seated outside and it wasn't too loud. We had an excellent waiter; very exuberant and hard working. It appeared that he had the whole side of the outdoor patio. The food is soooo good. I had the Mussels and Scallops in a red broth with Chorizo which is an appetizer but after all the chips and guacamole it was not only plenty but I brought the broth home and added it to cooked rice for dinner the next night! Very flavorful, rich, with lots of Chorizo and Mussels. My husband chose the Fajitas and was surprised to see that the meat was beautifully cooked sirloin steak. There was so much on  his plate that he was also able to take home the rest and have it for dinner. He said everything on his plate was perfect. Even though we were full and took half of our dinner home, we asked for dessert. We ordered theChurro cake that had a chocolate ganache inside and little churro fries on top. We are so happy to have quality restaurants like this one in North County. We will be back! Read more The staff did a wonderful job accommodating our requests. The mole is delicious- we’re going to try to make some but doubt it will be that good!  I ordered the mole salmon and was disappointed,it really did not have any mole flavor, my wife had short rib enchiladas,no sauce on top when served to keep it moist and no cheese.My son ordered the sea bass with black rice, that also needed some sauce to go with it.the rest of the food was very good,also the tres leche bread pudding- Delicious Having worked in kitchens all my life the chef should look into these items for correction.

Read more As with so many things, just not as good as it used to be…  Food was delish and timely. Everything was wonderful!  The Grove Steakhouse was a very nice restaurant. The staff was excellent.

My husband enjoyed the beef short ribs; they were tender and had plenty of gravy. He did end up asking for more spatzle because there was a tiny portion on his plate.

The entire restaurant was almost completely empty and the host and hostess gave us an entire speel about how we would need to wait for a table and that all the empty tables were reserved (even though we had reservations also). We ended up sitting outside of the Grove for awhile waiting for no real reason. The host and hostess working Saturday night at 8:45 were rude and highly unprofessional.

Such a great day and can’t wait to return next summer for more cabana pool days!! Read more Sycuan no longer offers the industry discount for cabanas.

Honestly, the service from check in to food and beverage was pretty bad. Read more Awesome experience - highly recommended! Delicious  food great staff  Hi, our server Carnia, had an attitude when she arrived. 
Said she was on lunch, although our cabana time was 10:30, service was scheduled for 11:00am. Carina did not arrive until  11:30, with attitude.  Then talked to the bartender, asked for help, his comment “ She’s at lunch, what do you want me to do about it? “

Carina’s demeanor slightly changed after her arrival. Every other server was very nice & helpful. Food was absolutely wonderful . 

Cari Haynes~ Read more Slow service but our server was awesome. Some of the employees are rude which, when you spend $300 on a day bed kind of sucks but overall a decent experience  It was a great time. Service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly.

The pools and river provide space for lots of people.  The setting in east county San Diego is beautiful.  Our cabana server was very friendly and efficient.

I have been there in the past, and it was too loud, but today it was perfect. Our waitress was very attentive and very friendly and great, but she might have had too much to do. Some things just took to long to get, but it didn't seem like it was our waitress' fault. She was hustling, and very good. Not sure what the issue was. Perhaps she had to travel to far to get things... Anyway, other than that, it was a perfect day. We got everything we wanted, and were treated like kings, and everything was great. Thank you. Read more We had the best experience. The drinks were great, the food was good, and our server was amazing. We will definitely be coming back before the end of the season.  We've been here a lot.  We've rented Day beds, cabanas, gone as hotel guests and attended concerts.
We went yesterday and got a cabana.
Check in for your cabana is 10:30 and they close at 5.  We checked in a couple min after 10:30 and were taken to our cabana by the swim up bar pool, right next to the big hot tub.  At 11:15 no waitress had greeted us so I went to the bar but you can't order from the bar toward your cabana. Period.  You must order from your waitress.  Went back to the front and asked about our server.  I was told she was on her lunch break and would be back in 10-15min.  Sooooo for an hour of being there you aren't allowed to order any food or drinks toward the cabana you are being charged $500 for???  Sounds like poor management.
That's the theme here.  You can tell it's poorly managed.  Every time I've gone it's new servers and none of them seem to love what they are doing.
They also have been out of something every time.  This time it was Pina colada mix and coors light beer!!  In East county!
Once the waitress arrived she apologized and promised to do a bunch of things to make it better...our cabana had no towels / the mini fridge was almost empty and dirty on the outside, noticeably dirty. None of those things happened without being asked again - and we never got any cans of coke cause SHOCKER - they were out of those too!!  They also don't have non alcohol beer , outside at a pool.  Again it screams very poor management.
The waitress was sweet and came around pretty often but the drinks took forever to get - food came out so much faster.  Food was delicious actually!  It always has been every time we've been there.  We love the ground beef tacos and the fish tacos. Wish I could give the kitchen 5 stars! It's a fun, beautiful pool but don't expect too much from the service or bar.  That's been our experience. Read more Service was horrible. Had a hard time hitting the minimum due to the fact the service was slow we went to other bars to get our drinks  This was a great experience, well worth the $ and wasn’t to overbooked.  Read more Our server was amazing. She provided excellent customer service. the food and drinks were delicious. We had an amazing time.  We had a wonderful day at the Retreat Pool & Cabana.  Adina was our server and she was fabulous.  We will be requesting her for our future visits.  She was very courteous, attentive and made us feel like ""friends"".  The food is very good and the atmosphere is so relaxing. Read more I recently had a disappointing experience at the Sycuan pool cabana. Despite the pool not being busy, the service was extremely slow. Our server, Ruby, was very nice and had a good attitude, but the service was not good. She either took forever to serve us or forgot to put our orders in altogether. Each time we ordered, we waited 45+ minutes, only to find out our orders hadn't been placed. Considering the amount of money spent, this was unacceptable. I expected much better service and a more enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the Sycuan pool cabana based on this visit. It seems like they’re under new management because when I went last year, I had a completely different experience in a good way. Read more Second time this summer and had an awesome time!! Can’t wait to go back again real soon!  I went for the first time on a Saturday, and everything was amazing.

But my second visit on a Wednesday was a complete disaster. The service was awful – it took over 30 minutes to get our drinks, and the server kept bringing us the wrong ones. To top it off, the food came out cold and even raw in some parts. I get that they might have been understaffed, but that's still no excuse, especially on a Wednesday in the summer!!! Read more Beware that if you book the cabana you get kicked out at 5 but the pool is open until 8. They don’t let you know that. Not sure it’s worth $500 in food and bev to not use it all day. Would have rather paid general admission. Read more Yesterday was our  first time at Sycuan and we went to check out the pool/cabanas since we are having a bachelor and bachelorette party there in September. EVERYONE that we encountered was wonderful. Emily was an amazing host at the cabana, she was friendly, fun, attentive and helpful. So much so we hope she serves our party in a few months. Josh was a very cool and friendly food runner and he gave us a lot of info for September. Spoke with Lauren the pool manager to get more info about fine tuning our plans and she was helpful with great insight! Great experience and we are all pumped to come back for our big party in September! Read more Sycuan poolside is always a great time. The servers are always polite and respectful and during the concert (our first time at this type of event) was no different. The staff was great and professional. Will continue to come back because the environment is welcoming. I will say, the music after the concert was better than the music that we have heard on past weekend day visits. I recommend sticking to the top 100 hits or something similar. In the past, the music has felt like “world vibes” which is not really our thing. Read more What a joke!! Zabrina our waitress needs some retraining. We paid extra for a daybed. She’d forget our drinks we would wait forever for. After waiting 40 minutes for a to go box and drinks (it wasn’t busy AT ALL) we decided to go to bar to get a box and order drinks. Low and behold this gal scolded us for going to the bar! She gave us grief! All we wanted was a drink. I don’t know what I was thinking paying extra for a daybed when we could have served our needs better for 1/2 the price. The whole experience was terrible! There were 3 other groups in our same area that had the same problem and had nothing nice to say about her. Difference was they didn’t pay extra for a daybed. They all bypassed her and went straight to the bar for drinks. When we tried we got scolded. I feel incredibly ripped off. I have never had a bad time at this pool and thought it’d be fun to “splurge”. What a miserable mistake. I waited tables for years. Never have I experienced someone with so many excuses for the service we were getting. I am so bummed. Read more Our server, Z, was the best. She was attentive and responsive to all of our requests. The food was good - would be nice to have a couple more vegetarian options. The music was the perfect volume. The lazy river was the perfect temperature.

See you soon!","Read more My friends and I have been to The Shop a number of times and were always happy with our meal and service. Yesterday exceeded our expectations because of our server, Shane F. He was awesome! He was attentive and very pleasant. We’ve always loved The Shop, but now we love it even more because of the excellent service! Read more The staff was extremely courteous, and professional. The food was prepared beautifully, great salads, pizza ; trendy, upbeat location. And fabulous cocktails.  There was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, which was nicely decorated. It was like a fancy pizza place.

I ordered a small Veggie Pesto Deep Dish pizza. The crust was unique in terms of texture and taste. It reminded me of a sweet apple pie crust.

I would come here again to enjoy a meal. Read more I have no complaints.  The food was good, the beer was cold, the service was attentive and friendly.  Outstanding food and service! Our server, Tony, was superb!  Delicious cauliflower crust pizza, yummy mixed green salad, and great service! We ❤️ The Shop!  The service was great; the food was spectacular. The salad was very fresh, Barada appetizer was extremely good. They do a really good job on their pizzas.  Great local non chain restaurant.  Great deep dish pizza.  Wonderful food and service! Way too loud inside for a party more than four to hear each other. My folks are older and it proved very difficult for them to hear the conversations. What a shame! Read more Delicious food and beer! Server forgot to bring beer, but brought it when reminded. Too noisy to talk.  Read more Pizza was excellent….one of the best!  Broad list of bourbon and rye plus other liquor……that I enjoyed!  We will be back!  Extremely slow service, 10 minutes to take drink order, 15 min to receive drinks. Food for 6 was delivered in 4 trips over 10 minutes so first was cold by the time everyone e else was served. 
Bathrooms were out of soap and almost out of TP. Saturday evening at 6:45pm should have been well staffed. Something was off! Read more The outdoors with sun and the food is always great to count on for flavor and appeal. The staff is always so kind and attentive.  The place is centrally located in a strip mall with lots of parking. It has an outside patio which is a plus for me. The place is cute and staff are friendly. The food is great.  The ambience is nice, it is pretty and not too loud, so you can have a conversation without having to yell, which I appreciate. The happy hour menu could be expanded. There are only three food items: the bruschetta, which is okay, but really just tostinis with two halves of a cherry tomato and some balsamic reduction; the spicy cheesy bread, which I was very much lookimg forward to, but was a sort of miniature deep dish pizza with an overflowing reservoir of too much melted cheese; and the wings, which are okay, more drumsticks than wings. The happy hour wines leave something to be desired, as the happy hour red was more than once unavailable,  and was only replaced with another red the first time I went, but not the second. I was pretty surprised that in not offering a replacement red for HH, there was only a white and a rosé to choose from. That being said, it is a nice wine selection, with multiple wines being made of organic grapes. The ceasar salad was above average and used quality lettuce.  The traditional crust Margherita pizza was also delicious and well made. Overall, it is nice to have a restaurant like this in RB, and I hope improvements or refinements will be made in time. Read more The waitstaff is super friendly and helpful. This is the first time I've ordered the traditional crust, Margherita pizza. I would definitely order that pizza again with the mixed green salad. Yum. A solid place to bring friends and family. I also like their movie selections. Read more The best deep dish pizza in San Diego! We always look forward to it and are never disappointed.  The food here is amazing! Love their cocktails! Although the service could improve greatly. Our server had 2 or 3 other tables and we barely saw her. I asked for extra chicken on my chopped salad, and it came with none. I mentioned this to my server that I asked for extra and she brought a tiny dish with was looked like just the original serving. Kind of disappointing. It was delicious though. Loved the wings and deep dish pizza. Would come back, but I hope their service will be better next time! Read more The service was not good. And they don’t think they need to accommodate customers  Dinner reservations for a weekend evening. I had read Yelp reviews & noticed people seemed to love or hate this place. Not many in the middle. I usually avoid places like that, but I wanted me some deep-dish pizza.  
It was not busy - I think less than 10 tables inside and out and maybe a couple people at the bar. There seemed to be 6-7 employees working with customers. After 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table we began discussing how long is too long to wait and just at that time our server came to our table. Our server was friendly and pleasant. Since we had been waiting a while, we were ready to order and asked for bruschetta, beer and pizza. 
The burrata bruschetta was tasty and fresh! We were almost done w/ that and still no beer. I saw another server and asked if they could check on it as it had been 15-20 minutes since I ordered a beer. Our server brought it out and offered to comp it which was nice. 
Another 20 minutes or so and we got pizzzzza! We ordered deep dish margherita pizza. Again, it was tasty and fresh, but the crust was dry and crumbly. Although we did not order cauliflower crust, we both were pretty certain that is what we received. Either that or just their pizza crust leaves something to be desired. 

My overall opinion is the place has potential but is not running very smoothly. Read more Read more Food, was very good, pizza & meatballs were delicious. Excellent friendly service. The outdoor dining was perfect. Really enjoyable experience.  It was delicious outside meal, celebrating our friends birthday.  The food is consistently really good, fresh ingredients, great service and the restaurant has lots of energy.  What a happy surprise.  To find a really good restaurant oddly enough is not easy.  This restaurant is fabulous.  The food was amazing, the ice tea was amazing, every bite had flavor. After my first bite my first thought was when am I coming back and who will I bring.  Definitely recommended. Read more Food - who puts a sub style salami on a pizza - so gross - maybe should have done the deep dish style instead of traditional
Service - pretty poor showing - counted 8 worker, prob 5 tables and it’s like we didn’t exist.
Price - pretty high for the quality - hope they invest in hard salami for pizza vs being cheap and using one type for all meals…sigh.
Ambiance - in a strip mall next to a subway and another restaurant…not fancy but acts fancy. Read more We have been eating at The Shop practically since it opened in RB.  The food, and specifically the crust of the deep dish pizzas, are consistently outstanding.  Over the past 2-3 months, there appears to be more wait staff and their attentiveness is great and timely.  We love this place!! Read more Introduced The Shop to a friend from Escondido. He’d never been and was impressed with the cocktail and wine selection. We sat outside and had a wonderful meal - burrata started, Caesar salad, traditional crust combo pizza. We just love it here.

Only suggestion would be to use Kalamata olives on the pizza. Read more Very friendly service. The owner even came over to make sure we had a great meal and experience.

I made the reservation two weeks ahead of time. I received 3 texts to confirm that we were a table of 10 for 5:15 on a Saturday night. I responded to all three. My husband and I were going to a matinee movie in San Marcos at 3pm, so we figured that our guests might get there ahead of us. I wanted to make sure that we had a nice inside table with a view and that it was not in the middle of the restaurant where it might be noisy. So, I stopped by the restaurant on Friday, to look at the layout. The young lady at the front wasn’t very busy, so, she showed me around. She said that the only table outside that would accommodate 10 people was way to the back side, near some bushes, and it didn’t look very appealing. We looked inside and found the perfect table, overlooking the putting green in an alcove, away from the middle of the restaurant. I told her that it would be perfect! She wrote the table number on my reservation to make sure it would be clear to anyone at the front desk on Saturday night. As predicted, our guests arrived about 8 minutes before we did, around 5:10 to 5:15. When we arrived, the host told them that I had made a reservation for an outside table. Fortunately, I had texted them all, letting them know exactly which table was ours, so that they made enough of a fuss to be able to secure the table, after waiting 5-10 minutes. We arrived just as they were being seated. I’m so glad that it turned out in the long run, no thanks to the staff at the front, who were prepared to put my guests outside. It just shows how far one has to go to get the best service, and it still may not be enough. Long story ending: we all had a great time and enjoyed the evening at Brickman’s! The portions were large, they accommodated separate checks for each couple, the food was excellent and everyone took some leftovers for a meal the next day. We will be back, but I hope the manager stresses the importance of communication among staff and sticking to promises to patrons. Read more Limited brunch menu but adequate choices. Good cocktails. Golf course view.  Service is always outstanding and the food is delicious. Love that they have a water dish for our pup!  Get the cookie for dessert, you won't regret it.  Food was amazing. And the atmosphere was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back! Riley was very attentive and absolutely adorable. Give him a raise 🙃  This was BY FAR the BEST Italian food we’ve ever had. The authenticity of this place is spot on, I seriously thought we were in Italy having pasta there. Everything is so fresh and flavorful. I wish we lived closer just because of this restaurant. We raved about it ALL weekend. 10/10 recommend!!!!! Read more Ordered the Caesar salad with the $13 add on of Sirloin steak medium temperature. Salad arrived with steak like shoe leather. Server took it back to kitchen and said they will correct it. Waited almost 20 minutes for it to come back out. Lettuce was not fresh - had that bagged funny taste.

Husband had the veggie burger and said it was good. Cheddar onion rings were amazing! 

Had our free Orfila Owl member glass at the bar. Service was terrible. A lot of employees milling around, yet we had to wait almost 10 minutes before some served us.

Nice location. First time trying the restaurant. Will go back to our free Owl member glasses of wine since they shut down the Oceanside Orfila tasting room. They really need to improve on their service. Read more Good food, great server, the leadership needs to work on informing the servers about Orfila wines and any discounts offered, ie the 30% disc on select wines until 9/30.

And the outdoor patio is spectacular. Our server, Ella, is attentive and personable and made our evening memorable. Read more We had a great brunch at Brickman's!  The food was delicious and prepared very quickly for a group of eleven.
Service was great too!  We went there to hear the live music, but unfortunately we're seated so far back we couldn't hear the music.  We were sat is a big room that was freezing and the blinds were down, so we took it upon ourselves to open them and it was better.  Food was good but I personally order eggs Benedict and the eggs were so overcooked it ruined this meal for me. Others got the breakfast burrito, which was delicious, but big, and could easily be shared. Another got the breakfast sandwich and it was also good.  Service was a bit slow and the real bummer was the waiters never smiled and were quick to step away from the table when they ever did check on us. Read more It’s a nice atmosphere.

First time visiting since the change. Food was great. Host was super. Price was decent. The only negative was they were short staffed and had to wait for service.  Service was absolutely horrible.

We are thrilled to call Chula Vista home and root ourselves here. Again, benvenuti, welcome, to Garbatella Osteria Italian restaurant.","Read more Love the vibe, love the decore of the place. Food was reasonable price, small portions but tasty.Service was lacking attention. Waiter might’ve been just too busy.  I recently dined at Garbatella with a group of 10 guests, and unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. From the start, our waitress was inattentive and slow. We had to ask for basic items, like waters, and dessert, 3-4 times before anything was brought to the table. Each time, it seemed like she had completely forgotten about us, and the wait times were ridiculously long. They were not busy. We had gone for lunch at 1:30pm they open at 1pm.

To make matters worse, the billing process was incredibly confusing. The waitress automatically added a service charge and tip for each of the 10 guests, which felt excessive and dishonest. Normally, you'd expect one service charge for the entire group, but charging each guest individually made it feel like we were being taken advantage of. It seemed very unprofessional and left a bad taste at the end of the meal.

Overall, between the slow service, multiple requests for basic items, and the strange, over-the-top billing, our experience was far from enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend dining here unless management seriously improves their service and addresses the weird billing practices. Read more Our reservation was 9pm. We received a text message confirming our reservation. Notified them through the text we are on the way. When we got there around 8:30 PM, we were told by the front desk we do t have a reservation and they will be closing g at 9pm.

They did not acknowledge our reservation even if I showed the Open Table email confirming of the reservation.

Complimentary Valet Parking","Read more It was actually our second visit in a week we had so much fun the first time with the beautiful atmosphere just warm enough with the fires going and heaters on and the food of course delicious this restaurant uses olive oil and butter no seed oil cooking Read more Our waitress Alli was delightful. She swapped my first glass of wine (house white and very very sweet) for a drier Louis Jason Bourgogne that was much nicer. More expensive but I wasn’t charged for the first one. The menu looked ambitious but original. We shared a huge charcuterie board for an appetiser and then chose the halibut. Unfortunately the spice overwhelmed all the other lovely flavours on the plate and the fish was overcooked. I wish I’d accepted Allis offer of a replacement! Read more Food was extremely expensive for what you got.   Service was ok.  Never had our water glasses re filled.  Food quality was high.  Service was very good.

Menu is VERY limited and somewhat esoteric.

Reasonable value, especially for a hotel restaurant. Read more We went here for drinks and appetizers. We had 2 drinks each and 1 appetizer and spent $100. It is a lovely restaurant but a little pricey imho.  We came here for my husbands 60th birthday celebration. I even came to drop off a cake beforehand and everything seemed fine. An hour after we ordered our main food the waitress apologized and let us know that our food was late and on its way because our ticket got switched with another table’s in the kitchen. After 30 more minutes of waiting we had to leave because my husband is a type 1 diabetic and needed insulin. At this point we had not received our food an hour and a half after ordering. The manager apologized and offered us our food to go but this whole experience was very disappointing for what we hoped to be a nice birthday dinner. We made our reservation a week in advance and the restaurant was not busy. The food itself is underwhelming and the portions are very small.

Not related to the restaurant but to make matters worse the valet broke our car key. They told us the hotel needed to make an incident report and that we would have to talk to our insurance to get a new key. At this point we just needed to get home and they were more interested in covering themselves than providing any immediate assistance. Read more The server staff was excellent. They are keepers on any team!  Much better than expected for a hotel restaurant! Excellent food made with unique ingredients and combinations. Decent wine list and delicious specialty cocktails. Service was spot on.  And the sunset view was just as promised - beautiful. Read more Came for brunch after church on Sunday. Loved the omelets! Very pleasant sitting outside with an occasional bee flying by. Service was great! We didn’t have to wait long to put in our order and the food was served quickly and hot! Only thing we didn’t enjoy was the piano player and his singing. He was good but sound was too loud to have a conversation. We’ll be back though! Read more Allie was an excellent server, the ambiance outside was lovely!
The food was delicious and we will be back!  Read more Our experience began with a warm welcome from Jack, in Valet Parking.  The hotel is just absolutely lovely, beautiful.  And the employees are all delightful.  Couldn't have been better.  We went for lunch, got there early, so had some breakfast, hung around a bit, then had lunch.  How's that?!  Really, everything was perfect in every way.  I hope Jack is there to greet you when you arrive.  It's a great beginning to a really lovely experience.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Read more Raphael was an excellent server. Very attentive, patient and friendly!  Service was poor. Food was great, but severely overpriced relatively.  The ambience is wonderful, looking out at the sunset sitting by gentle flames. Food over the top, but our server Allie made the experience very special! So personable and just delightful!  We had a wonderful dinner outside in the cozy covered area with our labradoodle. Super pleasant experience.  Our server was excellent, polite and knowledgeable, however, overall the restaurant was understaffed, and she was having to cover too many tables. Appetizers scallops were good, especially the corn chowder, the other two were fair. This steak entrée was cooked perfectly and excellent. Couscous was good. The Algerian style carrots were underwhelming both in flavor and in amount I doubt there was less than one carrot in the side. Chocolate mousse was good as was the olive oil cake.

We sat outside, the weather was perfect, the setting was excellent, noise level very acceptable. Read more 20 Twenty is a hotel restaurant inside the Westin. There is no view of the ocean. The food was ok but our halibut was over cooked and dried out. Service was nice but they only allowed us to split the bill with 3 credit cards instead of our party of five each using their card. Read more The restaurant looked nice, the staff was friendly but, the food was subpar and definitely did not line up with the cost of dining there. We had an 11:30 brunch reservation and there was already a group of very loud people hanging out at the bar, which took away from the ambience. I had the california omelette with potatoes and a side of turkey sausage. The avocado on top of the omelette was a grayish brown on the inside, the potatoes were some kind of variety and they were tasteless and dry as was the turkey sausage. I was surprised at the poor quality and taste of the food considering how nice the restaurant looked. I’m one and done with 20/twenty. Read more Excellent meal and service for my Dad's 93rd birthday. They put us in a private room and brought him a special desert. Our server Rafael did a great job and made excellent recommendations.  Superb experience! Staff at the hotel and Califino ￼ were informative, friendly, and made everyone feel welcome! Love getting to taste all the different tequilas!￼  Read more ""I'm convinced that this establishment is quite charming, and it would be wonderful if they could expand their team to match the creativity of their intriguing menu. The cuisine presented is both visually appealing and scrumptious.
Silos Read more We went for Father’a day brunch and it was clear they were overwhelmed. Service was very slow, but the outdoor space was lovely and thankfully we weren’t in a rush. Also we had looked at the menu online and some of the item online weren’t on the menu in person and the prices varied. $136 for a bottle of Vueve online but $175 on the in person menu is a big jump.
They clearly needed more staff. Our server was hustling, but it was just too much. Read more Very disappointed with our experience for Father's Day. Reserved an outside table at 10:30am for a party of 8. When we arrived, we were told they didn't have enough tables for us outside, so we were place in a semi-private corner of the dining room. It was a bit warm in there but not too bad. The biggest issue was that the the first of our entrees didn't arrive at the table until about 11:50. It took over 45 minutes for the juices we ordered to make it to the table. When our entrees were served, they came to the table 1 or 2 at a time over the period of about 10 minutes. Our server appeared to be covering at least 8 tables. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food but I don't know that I would go back for a Sunday brunch again. Read more Surprising place for lunch. Lived in the area for over 20 years and just discovered the restaurant.  Great place, even though inside the hotel.  I was told staff was short;  waiting for a lot of time to get checked out, but no one was in sight, so I had to look for someone to give the bill.  It was a great location with great decor! But the food was ok- nothing stood.  ￼￼Excellent service and great ambiance. Would got again .  Went for the happy hour. The charcuterie board was amazing! And the service was excellent.  It was a great place for Mother's Day -- they had a bouquet station and delicious food. In particular, the crab/oyster/crab buffet was fantastic. Would definitely go again!  Chris and Augie are the BEST!!!!! Give those sweet boys a raise !!!!!!

The ambience and view is breath taking! I highly recommend! Read more Apparently Open Table was not aware that the restaurant closed at 6:00. We and another couple with 5:45 reservations were not able to be served. Very disappointing.  Got there for our reservation at 5:45 and the bartender told us they were closing in 15 minutes. Open Table had not been updated with the right hours.  He was great about calling upstairs to see if we could be accommodated in their high end restaurant.

We did enjoy our drink at Pocket and our dinner at Vaga but were looking forward to a more low key experience. We did finally find out we could have ordered more casual food in their bar area.

This was a very disappointing Pi Day special, and if it had been our first visit to BJ's it would have been our last.

My wife and I celebrated the day me met 60 years ago, in September, back in the Midwest.  We love Vigilucci’s on State St.  The room is beautiful, calm and well lit.  It’s where we celebrated with 20 friends for her birthday 2 years ago.  Last night the two of us had a wonderful dinner, with fine wine (they have an excellent selection of wine by the glass), shared Vigilucci’s version of a Caesar Salad, The only bad note was the entrance of two diners, at different tables, arriving at different times, each with way too much perfume on.  It used to be much worse back in the day of Obsession, and has improved, but last night was sad.  There’s nothing to be done but suffer in silence, and concentrate on your partner and the wonderful food we were served:  We shared two dishes: prime beef meatballs and pasta (first time I ever tried them), and the spinach ravioli. Both were perfect.  The pasta was al dente, with sufficient tooth, and not mushy.  The sauces were, as usual tasty and spiced to perfection, and the meatballs were (also) not mushy, and delicious.  Nice evening, only marred with the need to tolerate the intrusion of perfume that wafted over us periodically.  Oh, and the service was just right:  not too intrusive, with just the right humor and personality that did not overbear.  He was excellent. Read more This is a first class restaurant in every way!!
The restaurant is beautiful, the spacing of the tables allows for intimacy and the server Miguel was so professional and perfect. We were lucky!!!
We started out with tastings from their showcase wines but then ordered our favorites, Montepuchiano and Zin Earthquake. Smooth and yummy. Our app was unusual…stuffed artichoke and we loved it. My dinner was veal marsala cooked perfectly with sides of veggies and pasta olio. Bret had the best OssoBucco!! It was a scrumptious meal. We will be going back soon.

Every time we go to Vigaluci’s it’s better than before. Angelo and Miquel are wonderful. The food is remarkable! We’ll be back tomorrow for another exquisite meal.  We enjoyed our dinner, this was our third time at this location. We shared salad with pears which was very nice. My husband had fettuccine alfredo, which he said was very good as well. I had veal piccata and had to add some more lemon and salt...it was a bit bland. I liked the veggies that came with it. Bread was great to start with and so was the tiramisu to finish with, even though I remembered the tiramisu that we had there previously was a bit better, light like a cloud.

A home run experience again! Read more Excellent food and ambience. Carbonara and Masala are perfection.  It is my favorite Italian restaurant and it is always amazing.  This was a nice restaurant but a bit more hype than the food and price. We ordered the veal parmigiana because our waiter spoke highly of the veal. It did not have very much sauce on it and it was dry. The ceasar salad had squirts of anchovy flavored dressing but not a lot of distribution. Overall just ok. Not what you would think for the hype.

Side dishes were extremely small. Pizza was undercooked. Service was slow. Would not go back  Normally, we have a great time, but felt like our server was overwhelmed. It took her forever to come to our table to take our order. I had decided on the  Buona Forchetta pasta with penne, and my daughter  had the Bolognese with farfalle pasta. My portion of pasta was extremely skimpy compared to my daughter’s Bolognese pasta, which was overflowing on her plate. 2nd pizza came out late & no refill on iced tea. Again not the servers fault, she had too many tables. With that said, service was slow and the food was unfortunately average. Read more The  restaurant was extremely noisy.

I was sorely disappointed in my overall experience. The food was overly salty and maybe I wasn’t expecting a small side portion of pasta with marinara to be $13. Service was fine as our server was friendly but maybe the value nor quality of the food wasn’t equivalent to cost. My other mistake was not doing further research that it was in the middle of campus either. Wouldn’t visit again. Read more Nicole our waitress was great!  We shared the burrata salad and a pizza, both so yummy!  Will be back again!  I came across this place looking for restaurants in the San Marcos area. The parking situation isn’t the best. There’s limited timed parking along the street, and a parking structure a block away. Don’t forget to validate.

The staff were friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The vibe was super chill for a weekend lunch date.

The fresh warm pizzas were flavorful. Portions just right for one person and perfect take out boxes ready for you if needed. I was impressed with the Italian soda. I love sweet drinks and my sweet tooth was satisfied.

Their desserts were beautifully made and delicious. I already had a sweet drink and I needed a dessert that was sweet, yet light.  The Panna Cotta was perfect!

I would definitely come and visit once again. Read more Excellent gluten free meal. Prepared safely and was delicious!  The patio was boisterous with large parties & smöl kids. Our table for 2 barely held our entrees, and the staff was shockingly inattentive… we needed to request glasses to accompany the water carafe, our beverages might’ve never showed up if not for us asking again several minutes after meals were delivered, and it took 15+ minutes to get a check - at that point we were tires of it & didn’t want to order a birthday dessert. The patio overlooks the street, and the inability to parallel park made for endless entertainment. Unfortunately, it also means that cigarette smoke also wafts. The patio is also dog friendly; fortunately the one at the table next to us was lovely & well-mannered. Food was nice enough, and the wine was tasty. Not sure we will bother with another try, tho. Read more Read more I have made a reservation for my daughter’s birthday last night on a Thursday night. I have put down in the reservation that is a birthday celebration.
When we arrived, there were only 2 tables occupied, however, the hostess sat us in the very end of the restaurant at the corner table, where it was awfully tight for a party of 4 since we were literally stuck in the corner. I have asked our server to sit us at a larger round table closer to the center of the restaurant.
The appetizers we ordered arrived quick and they were great. The main dish I ordered, however, wasn’t as good. I asked for halibut with mussels and clams. When the dish was brought out to me, I could smell a really bad stench coming from the plate, the mussels I was served were old as they were all shriveled up and the smell was unbearable. I returned the dish and ordered a vegetable lasagna instead. It was ok, couldn’t taste the vegetables in it as it was completely smothered in a white sauce.
At the end, our server offered a free desert to make up for the experience, but didn’t mention anything about my daughter’s birthday dessert even though it was mentioned when I made a reservation.
Overall, our service was good, our server was sweet and attentive. Unfortunately, due to the poisonous food I was served, I won’t be back. Read more We have eaten here several times because there aren't many good choices in San Marcos and this is very convenient. Our food tonight had good flavor, but it came out sort of warm, not hot. Bummer. Our server was a delight and helped recommend a wine pairing. We do wish they had a license for a full bar tho.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ review Read more Amazing wine, amazing views, needs some better choices of food, but we loved it overall. Deffinitley will be back  Had a fabulous time in a beautiful setting! Excellent food, excellent wine, excellent service!  The best service and people working keeps me coming back and being a member.  We love Mia Marie's.  The only negative part is that they ran out of Pizza by the time we got there in the late afternoon.  Otherwise, perfect!  Lovely afternoon enjoying the views and sampling the wine. Lisa was a terrific server, knowledgeable and friendly.  My dog enjoyed it too! We arrived early, 2:45ish and it was pleasant and quiet. As the 2 1/2 hours rolled by, it got a lot busier but the noise level was never too loud. Ended up leaving with 3 bottles...1 white, 1 rose and 1,red. The bottles themselves are gorgeous! Cheers to Mia Marie! Read more We had an absolutely wonderful time at Mia Marie! The views are spectacular no matter where you’re sitting. The wine is also outstanding…the whites are crisp and refreshing and the reds are bold without being too heavy. What also stands out is the service. Everyone is incredibly friendly, but Stacy is truly the best! She is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, fun and helped us feel welcome from the start. We even joined the wine club bc of her :) Read more Owner Mia and staff are fantastic !!!  Super fun!!!  Great wine!!!  Read more We did not eat, the wine was good but the service was excellent.  Relaxing and delicious time with friends Friday afternoon.  Cold on the patio but blankets provided!  Stephanie knew so much about the wines and was fun and informative.  We bought 3 bottles to take home! Read more Love this place sooo much!!! The views can not be beat!  Lovely environment, scenery, outstanding service and enjoyable music.  For us the wine didn't seem to hit the mark and seemed a bit pricy.  With that said, go for the service, the views, and the music.  We will definitely be back but may not be leaving with bottles in hand. Read more We loved this place! Wine was great. It’s dog friendly and has live music. Views were stunning!  Will definitely be going back. All woman owned and plenty of open space with shade. Dog friendly too!  Note: We did not have food, only wine, but Open Table requires a food rating, so I gave it 5 stars, the snacks available have been great in the past.

This is the nicest winery in SD County. The facility is gorgeous - there is something new to admire every time, the view unparalleled and the wines are simply the best around. Local winemaker Kiara is really putting together some excellent wines, especially the reserve Syrah and the Sauvignon blanc. Table service only, which makes for a very relaxing afternoon. The employees are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. We miss Stevie, but Savanna is doing a fabulous job in her shoes and has a great future ahead of her. 

Make reservations, because the word is out and weekends are very busy! Read more Great place to share with friends and family with  It was a great experience.  The views were breath taking.  Our sommelier was knowledgeable and interacted with us giving us telling us about the wine and the winery.  He made our experience very pleasant.  It was a wonderful afternoon. Read more The overall experience was great as always. Personally, I found the guitar player a bit too loud for the venue. We enjoy talking to our friends there over some good wine but we wound up moving to seats further away from the musician because we couldn't hear each other. The service, wine and view were still great though! Read more Read more Felt like going to a grocery store as the food items were of low quality and prepackaged like 7-11. What happened to the Amazing Cheese you used to have?  We did not have food.  Outdoor venue so noise not an issue. Beautiful back county view.  Beautiful setting, very friendly staff… we did not order food but I’m sure it would be great! Wine was great!  If you’re looking for a place to gather with friends or family then MiaMarie Winery is the place!  Relaxing spaces, gorgeous views, great wine and no one rushing you.  I brought my sister, niece and cousin for an afternoon of wine tasting and all of us loved sitting outside sipping on delicious wines and nibbling on charcuterie.  With each visit I have made, the grounds have expanded, landscape more mature and new varietals of wine.  This winery is truly a labor of love from its owners! Read more Spectacular view and great wines.  On the way to numerous other wineries in Highland Vally.  Kat is Amazing!  Be sure to ask for her as she goes above and beyond! Such a beautiful spot!  Fantastic chill vibe, really love it here  Great place and staff. The wines are very good, refreshing and surprising creativity in their vintages.  Great staff, beautiful vista, wine club is great value and wines are spectacular!  Very convenient for San Diego residents!  This winery is such a treasure,  there is not a bad wine here.  Besides the great wine, the view, the service and ambiance this is a ""go to"" place to spend with friends and family.  The more we come here the more others are learning about Mia Marie.

Great value for the amount of food you get  We were going to a concert at The Magnolia and wanted to have a bite to eat before. I would have never found this gem otherwise.

There were a wide variety of offerings on the buffet tables and the desserts were wonderful. The wait staff was attentive. The atmosphere was relaxed. I cannot say enough positive things about our experience. The cost of brunch was the best surprise of the morning! It's an excellent value. Read more We have been dining at Bailey’s for years and hadn’t been there in about six months while we used to be quite regular there and boy has it changed. We didn’t even finish our meals they were that bad. On a Sunday evening the music was so loud we couldn’t talk to each other at the table. Not cool. Sad our favorite restaurant has become this. Read more Absolutely our new favorite place in Temecula! Hadn’t really gone that far down into old town - GREAT PATIO - fire pit tables , heat lamps.. the food was wonderful but the service was even better than their food!!! Really, really attentive and kind staff … and the BAND!!! 80’s Brigade!!! They were absolutely amazing! Hope they have them back regularly !! Read more There was a rock band playing songs we didn’t like. We couldn’t hear each other talk!! Very annoying! Who wants to hear this when they’re dining.
The service was slow right from the start. Just to start off with a drink to clearing the table and getting our check. Maybe they couldn’t hear either 😉.  Who wants to hear this when they’re dining￼
The staff wasn’t trained properly. Too young.
I was served a high end wine that was too warm! Wow! I’m in wine country and they don’t know how to chill their wine properly! This is what they do for a living. 😖
Food was good though 😊😉 Read more Service was good, a bit disappointed this time on the cook on my filet.  There was only one bartender working and he was only preparing drinks for those waiting in line from the non-dining patio.  40 mins later I still didn’t have the mixed drink I had ordered and we were done eating so I cancelled my order.  They should have prioritized the drink orders for the diners versus only preparing drinks for the non-diners. Read more Food was good as always.  They did take a while to get drinks and the sides for my daughter’s food  The waiter was very attentive just hard to hear with the live music. Other than that, the food was amazing and had a great time!  We enjoyed having Saturday brunch at Baily’s. Our waitress kept our bottomless mimosas bottomless and other beverages replaced as needed. The environment was clean and well-maintained. Read more Our server Noah was very attentive. The food was satisfactory but nothing outstanding. The fresh omelets were good. Although the patio area is covered, it was still hot& steamy, and uncomfortable sitting outdoors. Unfortunately, due to the Sunday brunch buffet being set up in the dining area, there were no indoor seats available except at the bar. The hostess was very accommodating as well. Read more Read more My husband and I were meeting our friends for brunch. It has been awhile since we dined here but, I always liked the bottomless mimosas and their menu options. When I booked online I selected to sit in doors. When we arrived we did not realized that it was now Buffett style dining and all the tables were outside. Yesterday it was 104 degrees and they had no fans or misters on the patio. The heat was unbearable and the buffet select was very small. We all decided to leave and go to a restaurant that had indoor dining because again it was just too hot to sit outdoors. I hope in the future that will have accommodations for the weather such as, fans, misters and heaters for guest/patrons. Read more Great food, reasonably priced in lovely Old Town Temecula with ample parking onsite.  The drinks were delicious and made quickly. The food was not good. Three of us ordered dishes with breaded chicken and it was paper thin and tough like jerky. Service was struggling even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. One of the cocktails was too full and the server spilled it on the way to the table. When clearing the table, a different server dropped some of the silver ware causing a heavy spill on one of my guests. I was not impressed by this restaurant and understood why it was empty. Read more Huge portions. Nice staff who handled special requests well. The background music was a bit loud in our corner and they were happy to turn it down a bit. A good place for good friends to talk and have a nice time. Read more The food and drinks were amazing. So many great choices. And the staff were super friendly and attentive. We’ll definitely be back next time we’re in town.  The buffet was picked over when we arrived. Food was dried out and many things were missing. I would not do it again or recoomend.  I went to Baily’s with my family for the Sunday buffet, the food was at best average- hit or miss. French toast was ok, brisket was ok, but salad was soggy, I never found cheese in the Mac n cheese and there were no dressings or sauces in sight. The ambiance was good, and most of the servers were really kind; with the exception of some of the busboys, who wanted to clear our table every 10 minutes when we were OBVIOUSLY still eating (my dad still having some shrimp and a whole portion of brisket on his plate), seemed that they wanted to clear us off the restaurant lol maybe it was too close to lunch time and they were about to end the buffet- but it seemed pushy.

In general we had a good time, my dad enjoyed himself which is what matters. I don’t think I will do the buffet again, maybe try their a la carte menu if I ever go back. Read more After driving 45 minutes to our reservation, the sign on the front door said restaurant closed for private party. Why would your site allow us to make a reservation when the restaurant was going to be closed?! Seems like a simple thing to be able to block out the days of non operation. I wouldn’t recommend the Open Table app without calling to confirm first. Read more Reasonable prices, good food and great service. It was a good find and we’ll go back.  We sat on the patio and had a great experience with great food. It was a little chilli so they made sure we had heaters.  Read more We came down for rod run & the band was great & the overall experience was as well! Drinks & food!! Great time  My wife and I did not have the best experience during our visit to Baily’s, but let me explain. Besides the kind server we had, and the challenge of finding a decent location to sit away from the busy street event, limited food selection due to the event as well, profound smell of gas fumes baking in the air..I do believe our experience might have been better on another day. I know we could have done more like remembering thst evening was the start of the Annual Rod Run having been a local shop owner in Old Town. Just seemed our small date night could have been better or easily prevented with a little more effort. Baily’s is a great place to experience and eat, so don’t get me wrong my rating is solely based on that day, and what we encountered. Read more I made this reservation for my set of twin siblings birthday, as they came in from Arizona for a visit. I added that to the note on OpenTable. When we arrived I also mentioned it to the waiter and he spoke over me to tell us about the specials of the evening. Although we appreciate the information, it was a bit weird to speak over me. The food was not good. Four of us ordered the NY steak special. The steak was bland and all of them overcooked. 3 of us kept ours and one requested their remade. I asked for salt at the beginning of dinner and the waiter never brought it. When our appetizers came he didn’t give us small plates or silverware and napkins. We still tipped him but won’t be back. Read more They have plenty of tables for inside as well as outside.  Good location across from The Stampede and at the other end of Old Town Front Street.  Parking in the back, which makes it convenient.  The food was very good.  I had the Salmon salad with strawberries and it was very good!  I've had it twice now and it doesn't disappoint. Read more Reservation made but still had to wait. Had to remind hostess that we were there to be seated.  Made reservations to include a birthday was being celebrated yet nothing was ever recognized. Food was great. Service was great. Read more Great service!! Great to hear inside music with Those Guys. Food yummy and plentiful. Chef came down and was so helpful.  We arrived early and they were able to seat us, great staff food is amazing  When we arrived and asked for inside table they said due to rotation for servers they needed to seat us outside if we wanted to wait for inside table 3 outside tables needed to be seated first. We went to bar to order drinks and asked to speak with mgr about seating. Bar staff was fantastic and got us seated inside only to get a server that was poor at best. Food was great but service lack luster. Now a days it’s very uncommon to get good service & food, it’s one or the other not both. Such a shame Read more Service was satisfactory  and food was OK. No ambience there as this is a busy club atmosphere. Drinks and live music are good.  We have been coming to Baily‘s for years. Super disappointed in the last two times. Check in early and went to the bar to wait. The bartender was VERY NICE doing his best..  but literally said they were out of a lot of things. He didn’t have our first three choices￼￼. The band music even inside was so loud we couldn’t even talk. Bailey’s is an Irish type restaurant.. we also assumed on St. pattys day they would have corned beef. They did not. After drinking one round of our 2 nd or 3rd  choice drinks.. decided to go somewhere else we would be able to enjoy. Very sad the environment and quality was so poor.

They only had a couple of items offered for lunch.
I ordered the panko fried eggplant and it came between two large slices of French bread with Napa cabbage slaw.
The bread was soggy and the overall taste and appearance of it was disappointing.

I don’t think I’ll go back. Read more The food was good, but it took up to 45 minutes for us to receive our dishes. My girlfriend and I joked that they must be growing the food before cooking it. The service was slow, and it seemed like we were seated outside our server's section.

Our server eventually realized how long our food had taken and brought us soup as a gesture. This left me thinking there might be something wrong with the restaurant, as they kept giving us items we didn't order. For instance, when we were seated, the chef sent us an Amuse-Bouche.

For our birthday celebration, my sister and I enjoyed an extraordinary vegan dining experience that exceeded all expectations. The restaurant, renowned for its playful, innovative, and exciting array of courses, presented a six-course dinner featuring the culinary brilliance of Davin Waite, Rachel Hurley, Travis Roe, and Jade Chiu. This particular evening was part of the Plantscape Series, known for its unique menus that evolve based on seasonal abundance and the creative exploration of the chefs.

Our meal was a true testament to the art of vegan cuisine, featuring ingredients sourced locally and regeneratively, many from the restaurant’s own garden. The chefs highlighted techniques such as total utilization and dry aging, creating comforting yet boundary-pushing dishes that were both creative and inspiring. Each course was meticulously crafted, offering a delicious and satisfying meal that celebrated the abundance of the season.

One of the highlights was a deep dive into the flavors of sea vegetables and land fruits, paired optionally with natural wines and sake. This course featured a special dish by guest chef William Eick of Matsu, adding an extra layer of excitement to the evening.

Our server, Rayra, was exquisite, providing impeccable service that enhanced our dining experience. Her knowledge of the menu and her attentive, warm demeanor made us feel truly special on our birthday.

They did a really good job creating a nice vibe you wouldn’t expect in a track mall. All that said, MOST importantly, the gf pizza was off the charts some of the BEST I’ve had! As a celiac I felt super safe eating my meal and well attended to by Joey our server.
I’m not really a carb eater, but it was totally worth it and they have their own oven for gf pizza, so that was the clincher for me to try it. The stuffed peppers, calamari (sautéed in garlic butter with marinara sauce), plus the pizza and delicious wine…oooooml SO good! We’ll definitely be back 🌸🍷 Read more Excellent service and the best minestrone soup and cheesy garlic bread.  We will be back!  We sat on the patio for dinner last night and loved our food.

Very nice environment!  We arrived via our reservation time, and we're seated right away.
That was the last time we were approached by anyone. We saw 3 other tables get seated and helped. We never even received the complimentary bread and water.
I had requested indoor dining, and we were seated on the patio, which was fine as there was a good musician playing guitar, and we would have loved to stay.
We walked out after 35 minutes of no contact and watched others get helped in front of us.

Menu looks so tempting but the food is dreadful. Gave the carpaccio to the dog it was so bad. Took family here for special occasion and it was a disaster.

I had to get up three times to have water filled, server come, and for the check.  The server blamed it on too many graduation parties but  the restaurant was  1/3 full.  They also took back my order because they thought the salmon they cooked wasn’t very good.  For these prices, it’s crazy to come here.  Bottom line: totally understaffed and food is just OK.   Not coming back and you should not waste your hard earned dollars! Read more I WISH we remembered out waiters name because he was FANTASTIC with our group of 14. I will DEFINITELY be back!  Had a reservation on Mother's Day. When we arrived, we were sat right away. We went to the bathroom and the sink on the right was not working and the sink to the left was so scalding hot, steam was coming out. Luckily I touched the water before my toddler. When we sat back down, we let the host know we were ready to order. She let us know she would tell our server. Our server never came. No one acknowledged us.
About 30 min later, the manager, Jose V, noticed us and came to take our order. He was very friendly and even interacted with my toddler.
Considering it was Mother's Day, it didn't take long for our food to come out. They made a mistake on my sister's salad, however Jose fixed the problem when he came to check in on us after our food was delivered.
The rest of our dining experience, we had no clue who our server was. No one even made eye contact with us. I finally asked the host if she could get us the check. She told us she would let our sever know. Our server never came with our check. We finally asked to speak to the manager Jose, and I informed him of the horrible dining experience. I was livid and he could tell. Jose responded very appropriately, very apologetic, and beyond friendly- which I appreciated.
We were told there was a miscommunication and our server did not know we were her table. That was confusing because who was the host talking to every time she told us she would tell our server? The person who was supposed to be our sever ran into my sister in the bathroom and apologized.
If it wasn't for Jose V, I would have given this place a negative rating if I could. Thank you Jose for taking care of us. Thank you to the kitchen staff that had our food out fairly quickly on Mother's Day. Thank you to the server who did end up apologizing in the end.

The food was outstanding! We had the Crab & Shrimp Fondue, Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi, Grilled Marinated Swordfish, and creme brulee and mud pie for dessert -- and they were all so delicious! The one problem was that my husband's swordfish did not come out with the mahi mahi (we think that another server ""stole"" our swordfish from the kitchen and gave it to the diners next to us who arrived later than us and received their food before we did). However, our server and the manager apologized profusely, and the manager gave us a complimentary order of the mud pie for dessert. Kudos to them for addressing the situation.

Beautiful Atmosphere!  Our server was amazing and the location was quaint and beautiful, but the food was underwhelming.

We ordered a $38 charcuterie platter, but there wasn't anything on it (other than the local honey) that I couldn't have made myself at home. It was fine, but not for $38.00. The cheeses were what you'd find at a supermarket - the smoked Gouda I have on my sandwiches every day for lunch. The meats were a thick-cut less-dry prosciutto, and a salami, neither were special. The mustard was good, but not any better than the Grey Poupon in the fridge at my airBnB. And the ""fresh fruit"" was just a bunch of (not very good) red grapes.

The salad I ordered had a delicious soft cheese on it, but the portions were all wrong. The lettuce they chose was spinach, but they put SO MUCH cheese on it that the spinach was drowning and completely wilted under the weight. If there was dressing on the spinach, I couldn't tell because of all the cheese. The beets were good, and worked nicely with the cheese. There were two very small segments of blood orange on the top, as a garnish. I would have preferred the orange be an ingredient. There were 4 candied pecans. These were also good, would have made a nice addition if I could have had more than 4.

My mom ordered the Chilean sea bass, and it was cooked absolutely PERFECTLY. It was crispy on the outside but tender and soft underneath. It had an avocado topping that was also to die for - and paired perfectly with the fish. The side of couscous, however, had vegetables mixed in, and they tasted as though they were taken from a CupRamen. The carrots seemed like they had been dehydrated, they were chewy and wrinkly and retained no crunch.

The dessert, as recommended by our friendly server, was quite good! It was a chocolate mouse in a dome shape, with raspberry drizzle on the plate, and a raspberry in the middle of the mouse. We didn't know it would be a mouse when we ordered it, we were expecting a flourless chocolate cake, but we liked it! Read more Wonderful service by Cindy.  Large portions .  Beautiful scenery  Restaurant was warm due to side door being open to outdoor patio.

Very good service
Overall good experience Read more The whole experience at ponte vineyard was just amazing, at both restaurants. The bouquet and the restaurant at ponte!  Kayla was exceptional… thank you for showing us that customer service still exists  The food was fantastic and our server was wonderful.  We were celebrating my birthday.

Love the pool and the pool bar where it has food and beer and cocktails. Read more It’s always a wonderful experience in this restaurant and hotel.

Read more Very serene ambience.Had a nice peaceful brunch with friends.Will try a different dish next time.I ordered Benedict but the English muffin kind of rubbery texture.  Always enjoy Bouquet Restaurant … outdoor seating is lovely!  Revisiting the Bouquet Room at Ponte Inn brought back memories of my last visit with my husband.  The ambiance was understated elegance and perfect for a lovely meal.  The service was excellent.  Cindy was cheerful, knowledgeable and professional. Hunter did a wonderful job efficiently clearing our plates and filling our water.  He was courteous and respectful.  
I tasted my son's hamburger and believe it was the best I've ever had.  The meat quality was top-notch and the burger was cooked to a perfect medium-rare.
My Eggs Benedict was very good. I thought that the Canadian Bacon could have been cut thicker.  IT was a bit skimpy and a little dry because of the thinness of the cut. Sometimes it's best to charge a little more and get the Benedict as it is supposed to be.
 The menu had an overall appeal.  
We would return in a heartbeat to try other items on the menu. Read more Read more Excellent ambiance, food and service!  Definitely recommend for brunch  As a new Ponte Winery Club member I was excited to revisit Bouquet (One of the member perks is a discount at Bouquet!). 

I made the reservation online two days before. I get that they want to keep tables open for hotel guests, but there was only 1 reservation time available online and when we arrived the restaurant had plenty of availability.

I took my mom for an early Mother's Day dinner. She had never been before and was entranced by the beautiful and serene architecture and gardens on the property. 

James was our host made us feel more than welcome and took great care of us throughout our entire experience. 

My mom enjoyed Ponte's Pino Grigio and I indulged in a strawberry and mint fauxjito - non-alcoholic - that was perfectly sweet and refreshing.

Our Beet Salad starter was lovely and just the right amount to share between us. Our next course we both ordered the chicken piccata. This is usually a decent dish wherever you go, but both concluded that this was THE best chicken piccata we have ever tested. EVER! And my mom is nearly 80 and had her fair share of chicken piccata.

We didn't have room for desert but enjoyed a nice chat after our meal without being hounded with the bill, which I find most restaurants are eager to hand you and flip the table. 

We enjoyed a nice stroll on the grounds just as the sun went down and then ventured downstairs to the basement bar. 


Gorgeous setting. Amazing food. Stunning menu and flavors. Thoughtful and attentive staff. 

I can't wait to bring more guests and make more memories at Bouquet. 

Thank you James, Chef and the Bouquet Team. Read more Beautiful Setting, great service. Food was good. I enjoyed the grilled salmon.

Always a pleasure to dine at the Bouquet and service was amazing.  Ponte is one of our favorite places to go. It’s a little expensive for what they offer but you kind of need to expect that as part of the wine country experience. Overall it was a great visit. Our server Jacob was very attentive, and the host Larissa was accommodating with our seating request, even on a busy brunch morning. We’ll definitely be returning. Read more Chris was our server and he is always friendly, attentive to our needs. I love dining at the Bouquet.  A lovely restaurant in the Ponte Vineyard Inn, we enjoyed Easter brunch there for four of us.  Food is superb, they must have a great chef.

Just ordering online was not very easy. It’s not for everyone so I guess I won’t go back there because of the difficulty.  Food was ok…. Service was terrible! No cutlery with our food. Stood in line for 10 mins waiting to get a drink while all employees stood around talking… we won’t be back.  We have been there several times and have had issues with seating multiple times. Most recently we were placed at the table directly in front of the band. We immediately asked to be moved since it was too loud for our children and the hostess said she would move us as soon as a table opened. She never came back and after about 30 minutes I went to the host stand and explained the situation to someone else. They said we would be moved inside after the table was cleaned. Our food came soon after and fortunately the band was on break, so we could eat without the noise. The hosts never came to move us. We spent most of the time in the game area just to avoid the loud music. Read more This was probably our 7th visit to My Yard and it was to listen to some music on a Sunday afternoon. The fish and chips is still the best food we've had there. We got chips and salsa there at $5 but no refill on chips so just fyi. Got a basket of fries to share with the table.  Plenty for us all.  We have sat inside and outside and been there for lunch,  dinner, karaoke and concerts.  So all is pretty good other than prices for the quality or amount of food is high and one other thing.... the ordering from the table we've figured out but when we need a wait person to request napkins or about a beer, etc it's tough to find our wait person at times.  On the app, it would be nice to have a call button or some way to get a staff member.  This isn't a deal breaker but we've encountered this a few different visits. Each time we go,  we get more experienced. The staff is all super nice there and have made our experiences nicer.  Thank you My Yard Read more Read more We used to come more often, but after Covid, their service has gone down. The staff were friendly, but they are severely understaffed now. We came on a Saturday with live music and it felt like only a skeleton crew was working. I’m sure the mandatory $20 minimum wage factors into it, but everything took longer than usually and there were more than a few tables that needed bussing. Read more Food was ok but service was terrible. Asked multiple times for things and were left waiting.  There was a corn hole tournament going on outside. Our party of 7 sat outside and we heard music from the corn hole tournament and also from the patio. Not so pleasant. We had to order on our phone. Got an extra entree and said they would credit us. Don’t see the credit yet. No receipt. It seems strange to leave a tip for someone when we had to place our order online. Food ok. Won’t go back. Read more My problem is with ordering via QR code and not having an option to order any other way. After figuring out how to open an account and then place an order took us a good 15 minutes, the food took 40 minutes to arrive. Of course it was loud and noisy, it’s that kind of place. Just not for me. Read more We enjoyed the our experience at My Yard Live Beer company. They have a varied menu, and a good selection of beers, as well as cocktails and wine. And they have live music as well.  The service is a bit spotty, with no server assigned to our table, you order online, which seems impersonal with random encounters with servers. The food is decent, but hardly gourmet. Read more Not what I was expecting by the pictures but my wife loved the poki bowl. But I didn’t think it was worth it. Food for me was very mid.  Once again we had a blast at My Yard Live celebrating Father's Day!  Enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Bowl, Wowwie Burgers, BBQ Bacon cheese burger and the new Bahn Mi?Bahn You! sandwich!  All delicious.....  We especially liked drinking the new 4DudesBrew-called ""4StoneCold Dudes"" (Pilsner beer)  Delicious!  
All of these things while listening to a great band ""Chicken Wire"", in the front yard, what more could you ask for?  Oh yea, great service starting with Riley our hostess, Connor and Sean, our bar tenders and Tasha our waitress.

Another nice brewery to north county.  :)  My Family and I frequent My Yard Live, maybe once every few months. Great ambiance and lots of fun for the kiddos. Great beer, but the food could use some work. My wife loves the Poke Bowl, but it continues to change every time we go back.

We have been to MyYard dozens of times and even though we moved a little farther away we still make the trip back to have a good time!  OUTSTANDING service.

This was due primarily to our waiter, Tiago, who went above and beyond to create an extraordinary experience for us.  Not only was Tiago's service prompt and attentive, but before we were served he asked if we'd like to request any particular cuts of meat, which were promptly brought to our table.  In addition to Tiago's exemplary service, the food was delicious and fresh, and the other servers where excellent as well.  A memorable evening! Read more The neat was delicious,  salad raw salmon. Just everything delicious.  Highly recommend going.  It is definitely worth the price.  First time dining there on a weekday and the quality and value were as good as other times. Thanks and keep up with the good work!  We came here for my daughter's birthday and booked a 5pm reservation on Opentable.  We arrived a little late at 5:10, but still within the permitted alloted timeframe.  The hostess advised that their Wifi was down and that they're working on getting ready to seat us.  At 5:20 a larger table for 12 was seated before we were, even though we had reservations at 5pm.  I had to ask the other hostess to check on what the status was, in which we were then seated. 

For a Monday, it seemed like they were either unnderstaffed, or overwhelmed with the total number of diners that were finally seated around 5:30pm.  There were 2 waiters actively working the floor, and 3 folks that we serving meats.  Perhaps this was because Mondays may be slower at restauraunts? In either case, service was very slow.  We got one round of meats at one slice each, in which we mostly spent our time waiting for the folks serving meat grazing on the salad bar instead.  For ~$50 per person for 2 adults and $25 for one kid, it was not worth the total cost, which for 2.5 people and 2 indiviudal wines priced at $160. 

To add insult to injury, we explicitly called out that it was our daughter's birthday, and when I finally flagged down our waiter after waiting for 15 minutes, we weren't even offered something nice for my daughter.  

This is the most significantly let-down and failure from a service standpoint I've ever experienced.  

I don't know if we will be coming back again in the near future, at least not for Mondays ever again. Read more I wish the better quality meat was more available.  Food was a little bit on the salty side , not much variety to choose from in the salad bar and the side dishes.  Only one type of soup available and it is salty too.  The meats are too salty and you guys must do better. The salad bar could be must better and provide more of a variety for salad accompaniments.i had high expectations and they were not met. This is my 4th Brazilian Steak House and this would be on the low end of the 4 I’ve experienced so far. The Staff is super friendly loved everyone we came in contact with. The star of the night goes to the Carrot Cake…it’s so tasty very yummy. Read more Excellent selection at salad bar. Everything you could want to make a delicious side for all the meats that are being served. Love the continuous hit delicious French fries brought to the table. Read more Excellent choice of meats which revolved more frequently than expected.  Salad bar was exceptional.  The first course is a salad bar.  The variety was pretty good, however some dishes were not stocked. Nothing really stood out. The second course was a side dish bar and meats on skewers that servers would walk around and offer to you. The waiter would bring a small dish of fries, Parmesan puffs, and cinnamon banana. All of the meat was smoked and pretty much tasted the same. The quality was lower than expected. Most of the meat was undercooked and tough. We were only offered 4 of meats listed of the menu. No pork or lamb was served. The side dish bar was pretty limited and the dishes were lukewarm. All in all, the meal was really disappointing. 

At the end of the meal, after I paid, I stopped at the hostess desk to inform them that where I was seated was directly under the air conditioning vent, causing my food to become immediately cold and maybe they should look into that. Well, the manager came up and started giving me a some explanation that made it clear they were aware of it and still they are seating people there. Read more  The salad bar only option is quite expensive for the food available to choose from. The server did bring tasty rolls, mashed potatoes, and French fries for the table. Overall, it was a nice dinner date spot. Read more Don’t try using an open table rewards card here. Even though we clearly had it tied to our reservation it was denied. They shouldn’t offer it if they don’t intend to honor them. The manager was rude and would not allow me to talk. My husband put his hand up to ask her to allow me to talk and she accused him of touching her face. What? We came back after 2 years because of another incident hoping things have changed. They haven’t. Their management doesn’t care about their customer’s experiences. Read more Service and ambience was great. Meat was mostly too salty and overcooked to enjoy. Salad bar was very nice.  Tasty and delicious food all presented with excellent service.  Table felt overlooked by the people handing out the meat even after requesting to get more people at the table  We had a dinner with friends on a Sunday evening.  It was not very busy, but the restaurant was still quite noisy, making conversation difficult.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, and she checked on us often. The meats showed up periodically - either a lot at once or long periods would go by with none coming by. Some cuts were tough, and most options were oversalted. We don't usually order desserts but we did this time, and did not regret ordering the carrot cake, which they said was made on the premises and tasted great! Overall, a good dining experience but would recommend they use a little less salt on the meats. Read more I hate to have to do this, I didn't even think it possible at a Brazilian steakhouse but sadly, this has to be the worst steakhouse of them all. I've been to them all and being from Texas, my personal favorite is Chama Gaucha.

 I'd never been to Texas de Brazil and had already seen mixed reviews but knew it'd have to be one of those things you have to try for yourself. The only great experience here was our server who was fantastic. 

The salad bar was extremely bland, almost flavorless except for the potent items like olives, and the salad with the Brazilian vinaigrette.

When it came to the meats, every single item brought was almost tasteless, and some even overcooked, which was shocking. The tastiest item that was there was likely the leg of lamb which says a lot because I'm not the biggest fan of lamb due to the gamey taste.

Overall very disappointed in the experience especially with what you pay per person for the experience. This was a night out where me and my fiance were experiencing the new city after just moving into town nearby in Escondido, so wasn't the best for us. 

My feedback in short would be to really put more thought and effort into your cold bar and seasoning the meat a little more. Read more Great food; each piece of meat is cooked very well and the salad bar is also very nice.  Thiago was amazing and the food was delicious as usual! We eat at Texas De Brazil quite often and it’s always fantastic!  Great Meal. Lunch time service was good.   We had a great time celebrating a special day. The food was delicious, service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.  Honestly, this was our worst experience at a restaurant in a long time. we made a reservation and we’re sat at 8:15 PM. There are supposed to be at least 15 different kinds of meats that come around throughout the time. After 40 minutes of being at the restaurant, we had only seen three different ones. There was a table near us that we sat at the same time and had not received any. The waiter seemed really fixated on a table of girls that they were sharing phone numbers and Instagram accounts with. The manager laughed it off and said for us to waive our hands in the air when we meet in order to get the food. By the time we had been there for over an hour we had only had six different kinds of meat. For the price and the amount of time we spent there it was ridiculous. The manager offered nothing back and return and will be following up with the corporate office. We love Texas de Brazil, but this location has gone downhill. Read more We have dined at Texas de Brazil countless times and enjoy it every time.  The meats are always nicely seasoned and have “rare” portions which our family likes. We will be visiting again in a month or so. Read more Not the same as prior times. Atmosphere and service were great.  However we were all a bit disappointed this go around with most of the meats.  Flavor was great, but the majority were tough and several pieces had gristle streaks that made the bites inedible.  Having said that, the house special sirloin and the flank were both excellent!  Would still come back again in the future. Read more Great service and amazing food.  It was our third year in a row going for our anniversary, and we were a little disappointed that they got rid of the celebratory dessert and cute “happy anniversary” plate that we got the past two years.

Food was great, and our server was very nice but drinks took way too long, even just coffee  Great place to celebrate special dates! Best caipirinha!  Some of the meat was rough and full of fat.

They have 13.99 food specials that are a good value and a BbQ special on Thursdays.  One change on the BBQ special is that they changed out the Tri-tip for a sirloin, that isn't as tasty or tender.  Make sure you ask about how the asparagus looks before ordering.  If it is thin, they tend to overcook and is crispy.

The asparagus was a little over cooked, with the tips being crispy.  The tri-tip had good flavor, but was a little chewy this evening.

Staff friendly.  Unfortunately, we ordered 2 burger meals, both ordered med. 1 came raw, one came burnt.
Onion rings with burnt burger were lukewarm
French fries with raw burger were cold.

Our server and the food was excellent  Awful experience. My 6yr old daughter and I were looking forward to a fun dinner.

We were put at a booth quickly (we had reservation), and the waitress was pleasant. That’s about the best part of dinner. We ordered 1 pizza and kids chicken tenders, 1 adult drink and 1 kids lemonade. 

The drinks came out after a few minutes, but the food took a looooong time, and both meals were barely warm once they arrived. We said nothing and decided to just eat the food. I also ordered another beverage when the food arrived. 

We ate for about 10-15 minutes, I ate half the pizza and my daughter at some fries and a single chicken tender. We were still eating and my daughter  needed to use the restroom. I walked her to the bathroom where she spent a few minutes, and we returned to the table.

The restaurant cleared our table!!! Everything was gone. The pizza, her fries and chicken, everything.

“Daddy, they took our food!” We were literally away from the table for maybe 4 minutes.

I had not seen our server for quite a while, so I flagged another and requested our server and the manager.

I respectfully but firmly explained to the manager what happened; from the cold food, to the clearing of our table, and to the drink I ordered that still hadn’t arrived. 

He was apologetic, and had new food made and brought to us, along with some dessert. They also took care of the bill. It was a kind gesture, but still a terrible experience.

Thank you for the fast service!  Service by Ana was terrific and the food was excellent. had prime rib and it was delicious and had leftovers.

Everything about this Restaurant was A+ . I would highly recommend it to my family and friends!  As always the Brig came through with great food and service.
We had reservations but sat in the bar area for the tv.  My food was delicious. I had the blackened salmon. My husband said his pork chop was overcooked and too dry. It was so noisy that we couldn’t hear each other talk. I wish Brigantine was cozy and romantic the way it was many years ago. It used to have cozy private booths, but now it’s a noisy dining room. The food is high class and expensive but the ambience doesn’t match. Still, I’d go back - maybe for lunch instead.

Ann, our server, was friendly, courteous, and very polite.  Our go to place when we are entertaining family or friends.  Great service and dining choices.  I ordered Cordon Blue it was hard as a rock. It consists of two small portions the first way semi edible and the second piece was not edible at all. I was on patio the waiter did come by once to check on us, but when I decided the food was not edible the waiter didn’t come back in time my guest had already finished her meal. When waiter did return I told him the meal was terrible he took my plate away and never mentioned that he would do something to make it right. The meal was $25 plus tax.

Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  It was a smaller location than I expected, at the end of the bar an unsightly part of the kitchen is exposed which is off putting to see from a couple of tables. Why they have a booth by the toilets separated from the rest of the setting area is baffling. Ambiance 👎The location doesn’t work for the owners idea which is GOOD and on point.
HOWEVER the food was EXCELLENT.

Overall, very positive results, but some food came out cold and wasn't at the high standards of the SJC spot.   Our server, Kaili, and her assistant server did a fantastic job handling our large group of 15.  She was friendly, efficient and made great drink recommendations.  BTW, try the espresso martini.  I will certainly return, but with a smaller group. Read more Who cares what I think, but, you clicked. The good: Great service. Cool atmosphere. Good beer. Live music. I wanted the food to be better. Specifically, I wanted the brisket to be better. I’m not debating the “Texas barbecue” authenticity of the meat. I’m from Texas. And I’ve had worse in Texas. I was disappointed with the opportunity that’s possible to own something like this in California. It the opportunity being missed in a few of the details that make Texas bbq what it is. For this location, for example, there’s no smell of smoke when you walk up. That leads me to believe the brisket isn’t made onsite. Or that it’s made in a way that doesn’t allow the full flavor to come through. More likely, it’s made elsewhere, brought to this location and reheated. Either way, the full flavor of the brisket we had wasn’t there. Good cut. Nice ring. Both wet and dry options were good portions. Just not fully matured from a flavor standpoint. And, a little salty, which also can be a sign that the meat was rushed. The best thing on the plate was a flavored sausage that you wouldn’t find on a bbq plate elsewhere, but if authenticity isn’t the goal, then keep doing those sausage. I wanted to love it. I didn’t. Move along. Read more Came to celebrate husband’s birthday. Had a great time and the 3 meat combo was great. Had brisket, pulled pork and Tri tip  This was my second time at Heritage BBQ. We had Ribeye steak, tri-tip, brisket, chicken which we wanted to try something new. All of the meats were juicy, tasty and finger licken good. The breast on the chicken was dry but the flavor was excellent brown meat was great.  You can't go wrong on any of their side dishes, even the tortillas are so delicious. Our favorites were the Mac and cheese, Cole slaw, the loaded potatoe is a meal in itself and was great. I loved the roasted veggies. Their service was excellent!
